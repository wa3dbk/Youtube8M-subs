00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello everybody lately often 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.990
 people started asking the winter question on 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690
 Frosty for the plant 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 and warming up then stalls and very 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 hard to start I like well immediately 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.930
 it's hard to understand when you 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 This is not a long time to come across this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.250
 somehow forgotten so when i have 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 asking something I can not always 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.380
 answer the question though he is conscious 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.079
 somewhere I have the answer well since 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.120
 do you answer a lot at once a lot and 1 well 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.489
 I just can't figure it out today 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 his man is the same situation and here is a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.710
 Well, as I tell you here is already some 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.809
 warm already now I don't know winter is not winter 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.410
 puddles around and putty still at night 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 it turned out in the morning was tired 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 patrons ride to one place usually 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 start up with half a pint so who would this 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 the motor opened the output to believe and wait 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.250
 and here our cars say I'm like this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.010
 made and attack butter me and everything 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 never look that's how he 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.409
 there is no dirt in this defense 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 to k to a to a to a to a to a to a to a to a often 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.530
 see what the pilot looks like 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
 began to start usually enough immediately 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.540
 half a kick in the cold grow to him like about 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.000
 Does this type she is barely enough 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 enough and not like the world there yes well nafig 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 You are such that happened opening 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.040
 hood and cover distributor to the bottom like 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.700
 see this month so smeared 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.009
 dirt glowing to dirt and cover 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.909
 distributor all in this well as so slightly 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.920
 near and at the same time wet and 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.770
 it turned out that at night the frost and even more so 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.000
 drove through the day through the puddles naturally well 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.330
 how was vlad 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.980
 she froze here when frost 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 water frozen by carbonization on 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.759
 conducts aoki pilley 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.070
 there was moisture on the cover that i did i 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 just took and wipe straight took off 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.350
 only how do you wipe off well 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.770
 stage wiped all our x and a half kick 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.610
 I started up and lived like this 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.790
 if you suddenly like it may be 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.220
 from break 100 frost you started the engine 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.080
 starts playing and here you have 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.190
 there was also moisture for example and naturally 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.580
 engine warming up especially the senate to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.600
 the hood is protected by such a santoku 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.070
 Shumkov there still steam bath turns and 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.750
 moisture just sits on the cover of the distributor 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.520
 the spark starts to leave anytime 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.070
 only not on light he starts on the grass 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.930
 twitch his ending stalls later 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.390
 penetration this time on how to evaporate 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.130
 and again you start this one 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.070
 problem and here he is with us or she too 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.160
 happened and did not want to just wipe 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.060
 dry this cover with a dry cloth a partir 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.080
 and all for the work so here 's how 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.300
 cause 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 if u frost you started it concerns 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.019
 Anyone here is machine 199 and our classics 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 I just don't know 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.850
 injectors are not affected, so I have 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.300
 no injector i don't know but i think if 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.290
 module of the vector will also be taken well 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.900
 moisture like sweat and grandson 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.489
 will begin to thaw the possibility that this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.959
 it will be us until it dries 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.720
 there will also be interruptions so dag is just 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.410
 keep in mind if you suddenly succeed 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.350
 either bad can't start too 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.620
 thaw means most likely a cap 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.370
 tramblora or vice versa and the bobby I 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.680
 up put such pools smaller they 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.680
 Splash and whether it 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.450
 well understood yes rubbed the cover of the distributor 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.840
 that's all and so here it is again 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.720
 look you brought frost woman 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.790
 warming up and bang stalled you start 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.580
 start she grabs barely there 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.980
 the net does not start up later 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.530
 driving this time she's sweating like eos 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.250
 started here I do not like people wrote something 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.250
 to panic 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.950
 sometimes I didn't know what to answer 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.960
 just us things there attributed u like 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.010
 so guesses but it turned out to be just 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.350
 so if suddenly you did it 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.770
 open the hood to wipe and cover 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.130
 tramblora dry and only here will earn 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.920
 so the form think on it all wish everyone 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.770
 success good luck and here you are 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.870
 answered over the question if you have a frost 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.640
 stalls on on the engine warmed up 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.140
 this is going to condensate 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.240
 moisture on the cover of the distributor everything is up to the point 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.250
 it does not close the polyethylene immediately 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.490
 I say why because I burn Ellen 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.040
 we are even more moisture going therefore 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.780
 polyethylene where glove crossed out 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.330
 good to know and in the summer when from if 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.190
 we put pro-players and in the winter this washing is not 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.700
 it will be necessary to sweat there to gather and 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.790
 then I'm there like everything is now everything is exactly 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.130
 We wish success to all the best of luck 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.169
 I will answer one more question and see here 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.960
 people ask me too, as you can see 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.450
 Here's the oil does not flow like such as 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.970
 call and do not even know how to smear 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.640
 such oil here she has such a sore 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.610
 but it is in all blame the petrol pump and 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.940
 through these places here we have these 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.040
 quietly slightly seeps like 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.470
 not flowing but at the same time here are some 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.810
 there dc ladislava fly by and it 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.000
 diverges diverge so for this 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.280
 instead it can get dirty here without 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.740
 drifts well so the sailor yes not 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.380
 look in this goat goat when butter 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.980
 changing and now it happened 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.380
 that I had to wipe the cover well, so 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.160
 I think someone will come in handy a very much 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.470
 useful plate 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.080
 here this sore loose and cover 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.860
 distributor all frost when brought 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.639
 warms up 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.830
 all and all I wish you all the best of luck 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.800
 just good length to someone do not look 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.500
 who for weeks, well, look, I can't 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.199
 herself cut himself treat that same 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.009
 I want to convey the essence of a single person 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.689
 understands immediately and another needs 1 5 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.719
 repeat yes he understands accuracy 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:40.580
 so for all you will not be all good 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.580
 wishing success to all the best
