00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
true in this in this fashion I have

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.039 
true in this in this fashion I have
always<00:03:58.470> thought<00:03:59.000> the<00:04:00.000> best<00:04:00.209> clubs<00:04:00.510> they<00:04:00.900> have

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
always thought the best clubs they have

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.539 
always thought the best clubs they have
the<00:04:01.200> best<00:04:01.380> players<00:04:01.680> well<00:04:02.069> they<00:04:02.160> have<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.430> pay

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the best players well they have to pay

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.390 
the best players well they have to pay
so<00:04:02.910> what<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.599> think<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.410> Real<00:04:04.799> Madrid<00:04:05.160> did

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
so what I think is that Real Madrid did

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.800 
so what I think is that Real Madrid did
a<00:04:06.269> good<00:04:07.019> thing<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:08.280> think<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.360> was<00:04:09.540> a

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
