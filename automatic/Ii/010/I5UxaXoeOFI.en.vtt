there that thing that little thing it's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.780 
there that thing that little thing it's
like<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> rubbery<00:01:03.420> piece<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.070> fell<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
like a rubbery piece and it fell out and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
like a rubbery piece and it fell out and
when<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> rubber<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:07.020> piece<00:01:07.200> falls<00:01:07.470> out

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
when that rubber your piece falls out

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.210 
when that rubber your piece falls out
there's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.549> trigger<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> get

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there's a little trigger so if I can get

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.700 
there's a little trigger so if I can get
really<00:01:11.400> close<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
really close to it there you go and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
really close to it there you go and
there's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.580> trigger<00:01:14.909> inside<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
there's a little trigger inside of that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
there's a little trigger inside of that
and<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.130> switch<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> turns<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and that's the switch that turns the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.469 
and that's the switch that turns the
brake<00:01:19.080> lights<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.360> you're

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
brake lights on and off so when you're

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.100 
brake lights on and off so when you're
pressing<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> brake<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:23.009> disengages<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
pressing the brake it disengages so the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
pressing the brake it disengages so the
brake<00:01:25.290> lights<00:01:25.500> come<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
brake lights come on but when that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
brake lights come on but when that
little<00:01:27.360> piece<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.409> too<00:01:28.860> far<00:01:29.100> away

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
little piece right there is too far away

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
little piece right there is too far away
it<00:01:30.200> never<00:01:31.200> touches<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> never<00:01:32.189> Rhian

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it never touches it it never Rhian

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.440 
it never touches it it never Rhian
gauges<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.210> therefore<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> stays<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
gauges so therefore it stays on so the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.499 
gauges so therefore it stays on so the
thing<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.860> if<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.850> notice<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.299> your

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
thing is if if you notice that your

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.690 
thing is if if you notice that your
brake<00:01:39.720> lights<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.140> still<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.549> course

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
brake lights are still on of course

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
brake lights are still on of course
first<00:01:42.180> check<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> fuses<00:01:43.229> check<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.799> your

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
first check the fuses check all your

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
first check the fuses check all your
fuses<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.899> check<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> lights<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.619> actually

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fuses and check the lights I actually

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
fuses and check the lights I actually
have<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.549> brake<00:01:48.149> light<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.810> half

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
have one brake light that was on half

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.270 
have one brake light that was on half
out<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.509> then<00:01:51.509> go<00:01:52.049> underneath<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> check<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
out and then go underneath and check and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
out and then go underneath and check and
see<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.360> switch<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
see if your little switch here you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
see if your little switch here you
should<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.130> able<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> reach<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.969> once<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> want

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
should be able to reach it once you want

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.880 
should be able to reach it once you want
push<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> brake<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.899> broken<00:02:00.899> or
