00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.000
 you got through the Amsterdam training 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.560
 famous but also notorious 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.020
 in addition to achieving the champions league 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.410
 that centiem a penalty run of 26.6 km 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.890
 let walk today look back to 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.680
 that day in 1999 with the then 3rd keeper 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.290
 casper nelis well we had a 2 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.180
 camp in the in groenlo 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.739
 that is, say, a hotel with a field 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.110
 in a forest 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.170
 we have we both use 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.430
 made say we have we can 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.980
 indeed from training four times a day 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.860
 in the morning brother you power less forest run 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.450
 Then three workouts in one day 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.600
 the corridor 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.899
 super tough to have the end of the ride 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.590
 and need slutty agent against the house 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.170
 and yes pretty defeat 6 one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.340
 that was mainly due to tiredness 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.899
 only wanted to go to technical management 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.549
 make a statement with sir 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.380
 playful group and he is demand oriented in one 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.920
 which in retrospect means a playful one 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.920
 action is mentioned 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.979
 that playful action means that the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 players join the five quarters in rows 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 must report 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.070
 the car keys are returned there 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 then they have to walk 13.3 km back to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850
 the stadium 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 played in groups again I put it 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.039
 groups with jimmy van fessem and chris 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 residential park 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.789
 I myself did not return to the trance 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.470
 in that way we sometimes have 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.329
 what more punishment two you go under me 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.920
 aka Euro in your new home 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.049
 and I have to be sure 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.610
 I pulled him double what shirt 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.569
 in the beginning , davos me we want the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 the only one 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.439
 schiepers kind of fooled 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 just see 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.740
 they would go for a walk in the woods or something 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.470
 but it was not giving himself 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 second group you say then pass by 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.950
 yes I have 6 views that I do 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.590
 not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.239
 after photo jima herself job and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.069
 character is also mampaey and have his 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.530
 stood along the road 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.209
 and who must be arrested and asked if 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.549
 he wanted a piece of virtual far away 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.680
 and with a 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.010
 in la for the shoot you would have done 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 so you would be we say a little bit 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.019
 10 take so much yielded and be who 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 pretty much for themselves but 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.500
 soon me tilburg its so out of town 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.500
 and addresses continued 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.099
 Oh 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.409
 now we go a bit along the route 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.940
 animal then walked the time and where 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.510
 what do you notice when you see the route again 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.620
 so looks after smart thought of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.239
 from the trainer because this is not a bus stop 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.170
 here the the head close along it is one 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.860
 long way there are reasonable 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.180
 clear 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.190
 so yes yes it is also the nicest way that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.920
 crawl if you want to do this mean it 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.310
 is a long way to the tilburg caddy 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.470
 also cut so yes yes this is 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.940
 this year the kids you actually have 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.730
 not so strange that you also understood 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.299
 its me with i understand yes the cor 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.299
 days not different 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.270
 the three keepers will be en route 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.550
 understood by the assistant trainers who 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.900
 driving around randomly 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.420
 once returned to the stadium 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.960
 they must report for where sat 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960
 driver 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.940
 hda she was a lot of people there 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.020

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.520
 to his via that he just had it and 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.709
 yes that is very disappointed in me 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.840
 he was advising the idea that I say so 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.890
 but have thought of doing it that way 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.840
 it was kind of like that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.989
 confrontations or three and yes I was like that 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.430
 tired and I just wanted to have so years 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.280
