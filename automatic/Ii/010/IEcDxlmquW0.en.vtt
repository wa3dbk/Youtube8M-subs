00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 another video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today it is once again about the iphone 5 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 which will happen even more often in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 the next few days and maybe 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.480
 Even weeks and I was in Oberhausen 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 on the spot and I have my right there 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.720
 I did not have any iphone 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.400
 chance somewhere else without a chance 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 to get a contract and I believe 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.510
 really you can only say it's the apple 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 stores so the original apple stores 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 got the contract-free devices 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 otherwise absolutely no other load 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.440
 no reseller or premium reseller 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 or something else only the apple stores and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.380
 accordingly in the rush 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 Of course, also big in Oberhausen 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 hired there partially pay of 5000 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.719
 people around 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.489
 I do not know if that's really true 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.010
 but I know that's definitely 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 very many people were and it was 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 just incredible and I have to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 First of all at this point very warmly 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 Many will thank you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.350
 and without that I would mine 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 iphone with me right here by the way 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.710
 movies with the front camera not in the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 holding hands there I am pretty 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.880

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.409
 marvin and look in the video 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 channel and to his website yes then 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 I want to give you a little one now 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.299
 insight supply because I've got such a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 Filmed a bit and then we talk 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.170
 then again about a few 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.960
 small problems with the new iphone 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 5 unfortunately occurred and then would 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.619
 I say come here for now 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.619
 a few small video clips 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.619
 edited together 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 just 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.030
 meet invites 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.000
 the one in st 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.110
 brings good two 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.359
 you all already fit 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:30.600
 you did not happen that 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:32.790
 we'll just seen have we 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.210
 then take our iphones in receipt 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.060
 can 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.560
 and of course the unboxing then directly 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.970
 the link is up here again 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.970
 in the corner you can see yourself 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.830
 directly also have a look and then have 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.740
 we still with the nano are there before 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.480
 location from our iphones was activated 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.820
 backup re-recorded around our 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.200
 have data directly on it and then 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.100
 We thought we were done 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.760
 We really wanted to be 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.919
 go again 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.780
 but then I noticed that me 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.400
 had a small problem at the top of the frame 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.680
 I have only thought is an individual case 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.419
 Okay let me know directly 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.620
 have brought new device that with the 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.260
 rewritten bill and so on 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.570
 no topic super service first 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.760
 each case the second iphone unpacked 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.770
 looked again had a brand though 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.710
 at the other stop but again 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.419
 a brand that is so expensive 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.340
 device must never occur 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.380
 at least not guaranteed not directly 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.300
 after unpacking again 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.490
 said a new one so now get that 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.440
 third device and it was again one 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.750
 Brand on it then sure again to the 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.250
 plants so to marvin and so on the 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.520
 had the same problems and without 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.169
 we want to have a total of about 35 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.640
 iphones unpacked not only in the 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.090
 color black but also in color 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.000
 White 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.350
 Everyone had a hard time or something 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.620
 discoloration, for example, on the 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.419
 Antennas bridge really unbelievable 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.790
 We really did not feel like it anymore 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.500
 And that's the reason why it was 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.030
 just super annoying all the time 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.030
 to unpack the new devices 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.890
 well in the end we have now 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.030
 anyway an iphone bought because we are 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.000
 Simply put, we have now 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.190
 Waited for and 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.990
 yes, our legs have gone 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.730
 existed and then it is easy now 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.590
 to walk out of there without iphone that is 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.360
 no option 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.010
 we have now extended one year 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.370
 Guarantee about apple care in the basics 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.110
 in vain and then with so 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.730
 a very little here at my 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.920
 frame so you can see them if you are 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.910
 I do not know how to do it 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.740
 then live too 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.720
 i have my iphone 5 for this now 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.330
 that's what the whole thing will be for now 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.620
 videos come to iphone 5 and i hope 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.360
 that we will then at the next video 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.330
 See again that we think 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.930
 be course review for iphone 5 and up 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.930
