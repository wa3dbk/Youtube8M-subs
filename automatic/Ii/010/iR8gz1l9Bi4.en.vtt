in<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> holes<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
in you have the holes there for the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
in you have the holes there for the
sounds<00:01:42.600> come<00:01:42.840> through<00:01:43.170> moving<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sounds come through moving down the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
sounds come through moving down the
actual<00:01:45.149> handle<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:45.720> you've<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.200> sort<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
actual handle now you've got sort of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.429 
actual handle now you've got sort of
these<00:01:46.740> black<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.670> gunmetal<00:01:47.970> grey<00:01:48.479> sections

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
these black and gunmetal grey sections

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
these black and gunmetal grey sections
the<00:01:50.090> black<00:01:51.090> sections<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.720> sort<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> rubbery

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the black sections are sort of a rubbery

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
the black sections are sort of a rubbery
material<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:53.850> allow<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> hold<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
material so it does allow you to hold it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
material so it does allow you to hold it
on<00:01:54.659> you've<00:01:55.229> got<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> nice<00:01:55.560> design<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
on you've got a nice design here a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450 
on you've got a nice design here a
little<00:01:56.759> feature<00:01:57.000> we've<00:01:57.810> sort<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.219> bar<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
little feature we've sort of a bar of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.789 
little feature we've sort of a bar of
metal<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> outside<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
metal going on the outside and then you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.289 
metal going on the outside and then you
have<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
have the

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.569 
have the

design around the top at the top you

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.430 
design around the top at the top you
have<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> red<00:02:06.850> button<00:02:07.149> that<00:02:07.359> is<00:02:07.960> not<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> on

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
have a red button that is not the on

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.220 
have a red button that is not the on
switch<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.459> there<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> design<00:02:10.509> yes

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
switch it's just there for a design yes

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.559 
switch it's just there for a design yes
will<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.560> switch<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> blade<00:02:12.640> is

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
will on switch all the blade is

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.330 
will on switch all the blade is
underneath<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.860> right

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
underneath and you can see that right

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.130 
underneath and you can see that right
there<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:16.330> my<00:02:16.450> finger<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.780> push<00:02:17.019> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
there with my finger just push it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
there with my finger just push it
forward<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.830> get<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.069> blade<00:02:21.310> lighting

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
forward and you get the blade lighting

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.059 
forward and you get the blade lighting
up<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.170> sounds<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:25.920> hopefully<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.980> can

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
up and the sounds now hopefully you can

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.680 
up and the sounds now hopefully you can
pick<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.340> up<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.760> little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> different

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
pick that up a little bit of a different

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:38.550 
pick that up a little bit of a different
sound<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.260> Darth<00:02:29.470> Maul<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:37.349> Darth<00:02:38.349> Maul

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
sound to the Darth Maul the Darth Maul

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.280 
sound to the Darth Maul the Darth Maul
favorite<00:02:38.950> sort<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.220> more<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.579> throaty<00:02:39.880> sound

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
favorite sort of more of a throaty sound

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.870 
favorite sort of more of a throaty sound
whereas<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.410> Ventress<00:02:44.430> more<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.579> humming

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
whereas the Ventress more of a humming

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.490 
whereas the Ventress more of a humming
sound<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.630> said<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.290> did<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
sound so as I said when I did the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.920 
sound so as I said when I did the
original<00:02:47.680> review<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.060> sort<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.450> probably

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
original review this is sort of probably

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
original review this is sort of probably
the<00:02:49.989> first<00:02:50.200> time<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.620> there<00:02:50.769> was<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the first time that there was the the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.150 
the first time that there was the the
different<00:02:51.640> sound<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.360> Sith<00:02:52.569> sabers

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
different sound and the Sith sabers

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.190 
different sound and the Sith sabers
coming<00:02:54.160> through<00:02:54.430> anyway<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.599> most<00:02:55.959> people

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
coming through anyway as most people

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.380 
coming through anyway as most people
like<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:56.560> I'll<00:02:56.739> turn<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.299> you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
like to see I'll turn it all on so you

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.509 
like to see I'll turn it all on so you
can<00:02:58.540> see<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.840> full<00:02:59.319> blade<00:02:59.590> in<00:03:00.040> action<00:03:00.400> I'll

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
can see the full blade in action I'll

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.089 
can see the full blade in action I'll
step<00:03:00.730> right<00:03:00.940> back<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:02.140> there<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.739> are<00:03:02.769> going

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
step right back so there you are going

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.190 
step right back so there you are going
all<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.459> way<00:03:03.489> down<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:04.150> lot<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:04.720> people<00:03:04.959> ask<00:03:05.110> me

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
all the way down a lot of people ask me

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.710 
all the way down a lot of people ask me
how<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.470> would<00:03:05.620> display<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> best

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
how you would display this to the best

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.059 
how you would display this to the best
of<00:03:07.870> my<00:03:07.930> knowledge<00:03:07.959> I'd<00:03:08.410> say<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.680> probably

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
of my knowledge I'd say you probably

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.770 
of my knowledge I'd say you probably
look<00:03:09.280> at<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:09.970> your<00:03:10.120> hardware<00:03:10.420> store<00:03:10.600> and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
look at going to your hardware store and

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.680 
look at going to your hardware store and
getting<00:03:10.900> some<00:03:11.109> special<00:03:11.290> hooks<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.569> they'll

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
getting some special hooks and they'll

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.140 
getting some special hooks and they'll
allow<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.290> set<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.639> all<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.880> all<00:03:16.000> as

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
allow you to set it up but all in all as

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.900 
allow you to set it up but all in all as
you<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.299> see<00:03:16.569> I'll<00:03:16.720> lay<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.930> down<00:03:17.850> compared<00:03:18.850> to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
you can see I'll lay it down compared to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.030 
you can see I'll lay it down compared to
the<00:03:19.000> Darth<00:03:19.269> Maul<00:03:19.510> saber<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.120> long<00:03:23.040> you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
the Darth Maul saber just as long you

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
the Darth Maul saber just as long you
just<00:03:24.250> get<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.549> unique<00:03:24.880> S<00:03:25.120> shape<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.660> the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
just get that unique S shape in the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.599 
just get that unique S shape in the
middle<00:03:25.900> probably<00:03:26.859> not<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.010> greatest<00:03:27.100> able<00:03:27.549> to

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
middle probably not the greatest able to

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.800 
middle probably not the greatest able to
duel<00:03:27.819> with<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.120> probably<00:03:28.389> stick<00:03:28.600> with<00:03:28.630> you

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
duel with you probably stick with you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.080 
duel with you probably stick with you
death<00:03:28.959> more<00:03:29.650> flavor<00:03:29.920> there<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.730> you're<00:03:30.970> going
