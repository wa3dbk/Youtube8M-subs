difference<00:00:25.980> between<00:00:26.359> rotation<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> hip

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
difference between rotation from the hip

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.529 
difference between rotation from the hip
joint<00:00:28.260> between<00:00:28.830> lateral<00:00:29.760> rotation<00:00:30.150> which

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
joint between lateral rotation which

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.500 
joint between lateral rotation which
dancers<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.560> turnout<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.510> parallel

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to bring the camera in close to her

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.859 
to bring the camera in close to her
lower<00:01:12.750> leg<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:14.000> even<00:01:15.000> closer<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> can

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
zoom in great and you might see there's
a<00:01:18.659> lift<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> bones<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.250> almost

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
a lift of the bones right here almost

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.730 
a lift of the bones right here almost
like<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> literacy<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.740> she

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
like the literacy and that is she

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.990 
like the literacy and that is she
doesn't<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.460> much<00:01:26.670> turnout

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
doesn't have that much turnout

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
doesn't have that much turnout
everything<00:01:27.630> down<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:27.960> she<00:01:28.140> has<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> torque<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
everything down but she has a torque and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.969 
everything down but she has a torque and
her<00:01:29.369> tibia<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.630> weight<00:01:30.810> comes<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
her tibia as the weight comes down of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
her tibia as the weight comes down of
her<00:01:32.250> body<00:01:32.490> falling<00:01:33.270> through<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> center<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
her body falling through the center of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.670 
her body falling through the center of
her<00:01:34.740> thigh<00:01:35.250> bone<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.850> femur<00:01:36.229> begins<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.439> fall

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
her thigh bone the femur begins to fall

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
her thigh bone the femur begins to fall
into<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> tibia<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> tibias<00:01:39.329> curved<00:01:39.659> out

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
into the tibia of the tibias curved out

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
into the tibia of the tibias curved out
a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.790> after<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
a little bit so after the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
a little bit so after the
finally<00:01:42.690> displaces<00:01:43.410> around<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.160> third<00:01:44.460> toe

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
finally displaces around the third toe

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
finally displaces around the third toe
and<00:01:45.350> normally<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> semi<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.040> tibia

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and normally the semi of the tibia

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.270 
and normally the semi of the tibia
should<00:01:47.640> fall<00:01:47.910> over<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.300> second<00:01:48.750> tone<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:50.010> what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
should fall over the second tone so what

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040 
should fall over the second tone so what
that<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.730> do<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:51.630> Michelle

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
that will do is that when Michelle

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.140 
that will do is that when Michelle
releves<00:01:52.560> probably<00:01:53.400> her<00:01:53.550> weight<00:01:53.760> will<00:01:53.940> roll<00:01:54.120> to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
releves probably her weight will roll to

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.120 
releves probably her weight will roll to
the<00:01:54.330> outside<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.380> before<00:01:55.800> she<00:01:55.950> can

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the outside a little bit before she can

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
the outside a little bit before she can
be<00:01:56.280> stabilized<00:01:56.820> over<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.150> second<00:01:57.480> toe<00:01:57.510> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
be stabilized over the second toe so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.590 
be stabilized over the second toe so
releve<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.900> struggle<00:02:01.140> isn't<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
releve and it's a struggle isn't it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
releve and it's a struggle isn't it
always<00:02:03.600> small<00:02:04.290> ways<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.890> we're<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.190> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
always small ways so we're going to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280 
always small ways so we're going to
correct<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.730> in<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.120> easy<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
correct that in one easy and then it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.530 
correct that in one easy and then it
come<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.620> down<00:02:07.830> sweet<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> ask

that you need to so that foot is solidly
connected<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.850> earth<00:03:40.090> because<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:41.290> your

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
connected to the earth because if your

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.070 
connected to the earth because if your
whole<00:03:41.860> position<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.670> standing<00:03:43.270> is<00:03:43.420> already<00:03:43.870> in

whole position of standing is already in

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.690 
whole position of standing is already in
tension<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:46.270> tension<00:03:47.170> not<00:03:47.470> intention<00:03:48.340> in

tension then in tension not intention in
attention<00:03:49.630> then<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.680> will<00:03:50.920> communicate<00:03:51.280> to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
attention then that will communicate to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.390 
attention then that will communicate to
the<00:03:51.790> joints<00:03:52.150> above<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.630> stress<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.130> first

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
the joints above the stress so the first

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.890 
the joints above the stress so the first
line<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.700> defense<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.450> first<00:03:55.690> line<00:03:55.870> of

line of defense and the first line of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.660 
line of defense and the first line of
support<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.620> our<00:03:56.830> feet<00:03:57.040> against<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.430> earth

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
support is our feet against the earth

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.060 
support is our feet against the earth
and<00:03:57.970> we<00:03:58.570> need<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.900> pay<00:03:59.020> attention<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.770> and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
and we need to pay attention to that and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.550 
and we need to pay attention to that and
quite<00:04:00.670> often<00:04:00.850> dancers<00:04:01.480> are<00:04:01.660> trained<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.260> work

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
quite often dancers are trained to work

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.330 
quite often dancers are trained to work
and<00:04:02.910> focus<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.210> feel<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:05.200> word<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.680> delay<00:04:05.950> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
and focus and feel the word to delay the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.400 
and focus and feel the word to delay the
latencies<00:04:06.970> space<00:04:07.330> our<00:04:07.630> gesture<00:04:08.080> or<00:04:08.260> the

latencies space our gesture or the
gesture<00:04:08.830> leg<00:04:09.100> but<00:04:09.730> I'm<00:04:09.940> more<00:04:10.120> concerned<00:04:10.180> about

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
gesture leg but I'm more concerned about

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.080 
gesture leg but I'm more concerned about
the<00:04:11.230> supporting<00:04:11.740> leg<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.610> supporting
