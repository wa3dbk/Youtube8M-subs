Oh<00:00:59.940> got<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.970> tree<00:01:13.500> let's<00:01:14.500> give<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.680> up<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:37.150> this

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
Oh got a tree let's give it up with this

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.550 
Oh got a tree let's give it up with this
will<00:01:37.479> probably<00:01:37.660> end<00:01:37.840> up<00:01:37.930> making<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.260> couple

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
will probably end up making a couple

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.090 
will probably end up making a couple
more<00:01:38.740> planks<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:40.000> know<00:01:40.119> make<00:01:40.360> another

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
more planks and you know make another

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.770 
more planks and you know make another
pic<00:01:42.100> eggs<00:01:42.340> maybe<00:01:42.610> make<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> stone<00:01:43.060> pickaxe<00:01:43.119> if<00:01:43.690> I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
pic eggs maybe make a stone pickaxe if I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.940 
pic eggs maybe make a stone pickaxe if I
got<00:01:43.930> enough<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.440> don't<00:01:44.800> think<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:45.010> do<00:01:45.070> though

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

got enough I don't think I do though
we're<00:01:47.950> definitely<00:01:48.040> not<00:01:48.250> going<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.550> use<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:49.450> of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
we're definitely not going to use all of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:02.060 
we're definitely not going to use all of
it<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.020> time<00:01:51.600> charcoal<00:01:59.280> replace<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.520> one

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
it this time charcoal replace that one

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:31.980 
it this time charcoal replace that one
let's<00:02:03.070> get<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.720> over<00:02:05.050> here

there<00:03:01.590> BAM<00:03:04.050> double<00:03:05.050> our<00:03:05.170> production<00:03:05.590> right

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
there BAM double our production right

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.979 
there BAM double our production right
there

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989

about<00:04:30.660> growing<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.260> whole<00:04:31.470> lot<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.800> cactus

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
about growing a whole lot of cactus

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.060 
about growing a whole lot of cactus
would<00:04:33.840> be<00:04:34.110> nice<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.530> at<00:04:34.650> least<00:04:34.680> two<00:04:34.949> of

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
would be nice to have at least two of

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:47.150 
would be nice to have at least two of
them<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.400> though<00:04:39.050> daytime<00:04:40.220> please<00:04:46.160> all

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
them going though daytime please all

them going though daytime please all
right

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.310 

so<00:04:56.180> what<00:04:56.300> we<00:04:56.390> need<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.600> do<00:04:56.720> is<00:04:56.870> rebuild<00:04:57.350> the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
so what we need to do is rebuild the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.700 
so what we need to do is rebuild the
cobble<00:05:00.320> generator<00:05:01.810> in<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.990> way<00:05:03.170> that's<00:05:03.440> far

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
cobble generator in a way that's far

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.640 
cobble generator in a way that's far
more<00:05:03.740> efficient<00:05:05.200> don't<00:05:06.200> have<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.410> lot<00:05:06.620> of

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
more efficient don't have a lot of

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.300 
more efficient don't have a lot of
building<00:05:07.010> materials<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:08.060> work<00:05:08.270> with<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:09.310> forgot

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
building materials to work with I forgot

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.830 
building materials to work with I forgot
I<00:05:10.490> toy<00:05:10.700> downton<00:05:11.530> cobble<00:05:12.530> generator<00:05:12.580> actually

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.230 

so<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:18.020> is<00:05:18.050> going<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.740> be<00:05:18.890> difficult<00:05:20.680> um

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
so this is going to be difficult um

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.360 
so this is going to be difficult um
let's<00:05:23.240> put<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.600> lava<00:05:23.780> back<00:05:24.050> here<00:05:24.320> so<00:05:25.130> we<00:05:25.250> can

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
let's put the lava back here so we can

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.660 
let's put the lava back here so we can
use<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.730> bucket<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.060> get<00:05:26.270> some<00:05:26.420> water<00:05:26.600> out<00:05:27.670> of

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
use the bucket to get some water out of

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:58.860 
use the bucket to get some water out of
there<00:05:39.550> that's<00:05:42.490> cobblestone

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.320 

so<00:05:59.530> what<00:05:59.740> are<00:05:59.770> falling<00:06:00.250> next<00:06:00.670> to<00:06:00.790> lavo<00:06:01.000> will

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
so what are falling next to lavo will

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.360 
so what are falling next to lavo will
also<00:06:01.750> turn<00:06:01.990> it<00:06:02.170> into<00:06:02.290> Connell<00:06:02.740> step<00:06:02.920> that<00:06:03.190> I

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
also turn it into Connell step that I

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.260 
also turn it into Connell step that I
was<00:06:03.580> not<00:06:03.790> aware<00:06:04.270> of<00:06:05.520> probably<00:06:06.520> find<00:06:06.760> some<00:06:07.090> way

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
was not aware of probably find some way

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.590 
was not aware of probably find some way
to<00:06:07.330> use<00:06:07.570> that<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:07.930> my<00:06:08.080> advantage<00:06:08.110> here<00:06:09.600> just

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
to use that to my advantage here just

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:57.119 
to use that to my advantage here just
not<00:06:10.860> sure<00:06:11.860> what<00:06:12.810> to<00:06:13.810> do<00:06:14.170> exactly<00:06:16.110> interesting

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:08.429 

ah<00:07:02.550> ok<00:07:04.469> so<00:07:05.469> in<00:07:05.649> theory<00:07:07.080> let's<00:07:08.080> see<00:07:08.259> if<00:07:08.319> this

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:08.439 
ah ok so in theory let's see if this

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.550 
ah ok so in theory let's see if this
list<00:07:08.679> Oh<00:07:09.009> No

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:18.120

ah damn well there you go guys that's a

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.700 
ah damn well there you go guys that's a
Skyblock<00:07:18.550> challenge<00:07:19.090> I<00:07:19.330> died<00:07:19.690> I'll<00:07:20.470> be

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
Skyblock challenge I died I'll be

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.890 
Skyblock challenge I died I'll be
resetting<00:07:21.130> the<00:07:21.310> map<00:07:21.490> if<00:07:21.760> you<00:07:22.480> guys<00:07:22.600> want<00:07:22.840> to

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
resetting the map if you guys want to
