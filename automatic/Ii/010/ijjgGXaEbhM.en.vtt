pattern just out of paper take your
pencil<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.590> want<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.860> mark<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:30.740> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
pencil and you want to mark it the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.620 
pencil and you want to mark it the
pattern<00:04:34.639> all<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.669> way<00:04:35.880> around<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.509> when

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
pattern all the way around and when

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.360 
pattern all the way around and when
you're<00:04:36.750> done<00:04:36.930> just<00:04:36.990> simply<00:04:37.590> use<00:04:38.190> some

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you're done just simply use some

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.820 
you're done just simply use some
scissors<00:04:38.580> cut<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.060> pattern<00:04:39.509> out<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.650> it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
scissors cut the pattern out and it

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.200 
scissors cut the pattern out and it
looks<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.400> this<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.660> made<00:04:43.620> two<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.759> you<00:04:44.850> have

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
looks like this I made two so you have

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.180 
looks like this I made two so you have
it<00:04:45.630> on<00:04:45.900> both<00:04:46.080> sides<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.560> don't<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:46.860> any<00:04:47.010> of

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
it on both sides so you don't see any of

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.080 
it on both sides so you don't see any of
the<00:04:47.310> glue<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.770> we're<00:04:50.250> gonna<00:04:50.340> use<00:04:50.639> some

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
the glue and we're gonna use some

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
the glue and we're gonna use some
organdy

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.600 

I'll<00:04:55.110> play<00:04:55.260> some<00:04:55.470> wax<00:04:55.650> paper<00:04:55.770> underneath<00:04:56.310> it

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
I'll play some wax paper underneath it

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.219 
I'll play some wax paper underneath it
so<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.030> glue<00:04:57.150> doesn't<00:04:57.180> stick<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.870> it

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
so the glue doesn't stick to it

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.830 
so the glue doesn't stick to it
put<00:04:58.919> some<00:04:59.100> organdy<00:05:00.229> I'm<00:05:01.229> using<00:05:01.740> blue<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
put some organdy I'm using blue and a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.650 
put some organdy I'm using blue and a
really<00:05:04.440> really<00:05:04.470> tiny<00:05:05.460> amount<00:05:05.940> right<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.510> the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
really really tiny amount right on the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.900 
really really tiny amount right on the
edge<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.199> don't<00:05:07.229> want<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.530> get<00:05:07.620> too<00:05:07.830> much<00:05:08.039> so

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
edge you don't want to get too much so

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.290 
edge you don't want to get too much so
do<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.210> all<00:05:09.419> around<00:05:10.729> so<00:05:11.729> you<00:05:11.789> want<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.180> make

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
do that all around so you want to make

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.939 
do that all around so you want to make
sure<00:05:12.509> that<00:05:12.720> if<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.990> have<00:05:13.169> some<00:05:13.380> glue<00:05:13.560> going

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
sure that if you have some glue going

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.529 
sure that if you have some glue going
inside<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.580> edge<00:05:14.699> that<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.210> take<00:05:15.389> your

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
inside the edge that you just take your

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.390 
inside the edge that you just take your
finger<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:15.960> get<00:05:16.860> all<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.340> excess<00:05:17.990> glue

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
finger and get all the excess glue

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.360 
finger and get all the excess glue
that's<00:05:20.400> trying<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.240> go<00:05:21.870> in<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> middle<00:05:22.370> get

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
that's trying to go in the middle get

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:31.040 
that's trying to go in the middle get
all<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.699> way<00:05:23.789> around<00:05:26.990> okay<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:30.210> glue<00:05:30.870> it

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
all the way around okay and just glue it

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.140 
all the way around okay and just glue it
right<00:05:31.080> onto<00:05:31.680> your<00:05:32.310> organ<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.580> you<00:05:35.610> want<00:05:36.060> to

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
idea what a jump ring was until I

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.700 
idea what a jump ring was until I
started<00:06:51.490> crafting<00:06:51.730> so<00:06:52.270> it's<00:06:52.750> that<00:06:53.020> round<00:06:53.320> one
