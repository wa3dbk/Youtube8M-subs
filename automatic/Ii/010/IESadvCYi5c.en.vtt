00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
across the handguard which is again

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.760 
across the handguard which is again
plastic<00:01:06.940> but<00:01:07.450> still<00:01:07.750> very<00:01:08.110> solid<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.710> very

attached<00:01:11.979> points<00:01:12.430> one<00:01:12.640> on<00:01:12.670> either<00:01:12.910> side<00:01:13.090> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
attached points one on either side and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.320 
attached points one on either side and
then<00:01:14.020> also<00:01:14.340> integrated<00:01:15.340> into<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.790> rail<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.270> a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
then also integrated into the rail is a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.320 
then also integrated into the rail is a
flip-up<00:01:16.960> non<00:01:17.560> adjustable<00:01:18.190> front<00:01:18.430> sight<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.000> I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
flip-up non adjustable front sight and I

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.480 
flip-up non adjustable front sight and I
think<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.690> is<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> very<00:01:20.200> nifty<00:01:20.590> feature<00:01:21.009> but

used as almost like a full grip so those
are<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.180> basic<00:03:40.510> features<00:03:40.540> of<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.109> gun<00:03:41.260> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
are the basic features of the gun and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.050 
are the basic features of the gun and
like<00:03:41.560> every<00:03:41.919> gun<00:03:42.099> there<00:03:42.579> are<00:03:42.699> some<00:03:42.849> pros<00:03:43.030> and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
like every gun there are some pros and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.270 
like every gun there are some pros and
cons<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.629> course<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.409> pro<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.769> being<00:03:45.099> it

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
cons of course the pro is being it

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.860 
cons of course the pro is being it
shoots<00:03:45.549> quite<00:03:45.760> well<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.150> quite<00:03:46.329> reliable

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
shoots quite well it's quite reliable

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.240 
shoots quite well it's quite reliable
it's<00:03:47.260> got<00:03:47.409> a<00:03:47.440> decent<00:03:47.650> rate<00:03:47.949> of<00:03:48.040> fire<00:03:48.220> and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
it's got a decent rate of fire and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.559 
it's got a decent rate of fire and
decent<00:03:48.760> power<00:03:48.909> to<00:03:49.269> it

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
decent power to it

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.539 
decent power to it
the<00:03:49.959> cons<00:03:50.819> very<00:03:51.819> much<00:03:52.470> small<00:03:53.470> things<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
the cons very much small things the

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.699 
the cons very much small things the
things<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.970> really<00:03:55.120> annoy<00:03:55.419> me<00:03:55.659> anyway

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
things that really annoy me anyway

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.979 
things that really annoy me anyway
first<00:03:57.190> let's<00:03:57.519> go<00:03:57.669> back<00:03:57.699> to<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.629> pneumatic

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
first let's go back to the pneumatic

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.069 
first let's go back to the pneumatic
blowback<00:03:59.500> system<00:04:00.120> all<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.510> mean<00:04:01.930> is

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
blowback system all right I mean is

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.199 
blowback system all right I mean is
there<00:04:02.199> a<00:04:02.229> point<00:04:02.470> really<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.489> kind<00:04:03.729> of<00:04:03.819> cycles<00:04:04.150> a

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
there a point really I kind of cycles a

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.390 
there a point really I kind of cycles a
tiny<00:04:04.419> portion<00:04:04.690> adds<00:04:05.019> no<00:04:05.229> recoil<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.949> don't

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
tiny portion adds no recoil I don't

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.030 
tiny portion adds no recoil I don't
really<00:04:06.669> think<00:04:06.909> it's<00:04:07.329> worth<00:04:07.569> it<00:04:07.870> if<00:04:08.079> I'm<00:04:08.680> honest

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
really think it's worth it if I'm honest

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.589 
really think it's worth it if I'm honest
with<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.729> as<00:04:09.879> well<00:04:10.030> as<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> blowback

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
with you so as well as the blowback

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.050 
with you so as well as the blowback
system<00:04:10.989> being<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.349> bit<00:04:11.590> redundant<00:04:12.159> so<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.909> this

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
system being a bit redundant so is this

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.809 
system being a bit redundant so is this
laser<00:04:13.359> and<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.199> this<00:04:14.409> LED<00:04:14.979> torch<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.579> 20

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
laser and so is this LED torch for 20

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.029 
laser and so is this LED torch for 20
quid<00:04:15.939> more<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.440> I'm<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.650> going<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.859> take

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
quid more like I'm just going to take

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.740 
quid more like I'm just going to take
them<00:04:18.220> out<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.579> don't<00:04:19.000> think<00:04:19.180> they're<00:04:19.299> worth<00:04:19.449> it

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
them out I don't think they're worth it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.680 
them out I don't think they're worth it
this<00:04:20.320> laser<00:04:21.159> at<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.519> front<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> little<00:04:22.240> bit

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
this laser at the front is a little bit

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.770 
this laser at the front is a little bit
temperamental<00:04:23.050> once<00:04:23.919> I<00:04:24.070> start<00:04:24.310> shooting<00:04:24.780> it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
temperamental once I start shooting it

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.719 
temperamental once I start shooting it
goes<00:04:26.080> off<00:04:26.349> and<00:04:26.680> that's<00:04:27.220> because<00:04:27.550> the

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
goes off and that's because the

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.450 
goes off and that's because the
handguard<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.389> too<00:04:28.570> far<00:04:28.870> back<00:04:29.159> but<00:04:30.159> that<00:04:30.220> is

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
handguard is too far back but that is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.730 
handguard is too far back but that is
hang<00:04:30.970> guards<00:04:31.210> on<00:04:31.300> properly<00:04:31.630> pointless<00:04:32.590> this

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
hang guards on properly pointless this

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.189 
hang guards on properly pointless this
LED<00:04:33.300> actually<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.330> don't<00:04:34.419> know<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.960> won't<00:04:35.110> be

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
LED actually I don't know I won't be

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.170 
LED actually I don't know I won't be
able<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.349> show<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.590> but<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.430> captures<00:04:36.639> the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
able to show you but it captures the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.709 
able to show you but it captures the
whole<00:04:37.570> front<00:04:37.930> end<00:04:38.139> in<00:04:38.409> the<00:04:39.039> actual<00:04:39.639> torch<00:04:40.029> so

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
whole front end in the actual torch so

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.140 
whole front end in the actual torch so
your<00:04:41.080> end<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.500> end<00:04:41.560> up<00:04:41.830> with<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.250> half<00:04:42.760> a

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
your end you end up with like half a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.469 
your end you end up with like half a
shadow<00:04:44.099> you<00:04:45.099> get

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
shadow you get

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.899 
shadow you get
the<00:04:45.569> bottom<00:04:45.930> half<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.379> the<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.550> other

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
the bottom half of the of the other

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.730 
the bottom half of the of the other
light<00:04:48.120> which<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.569> a<00:04:48.599> very<00:04:48.900> bright<00:04:49.139> at<00:04:49.319> all<00:04:49.499> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
light which is a very bright at all and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.499 
light which is a very bright at all and
then<00:04:50.189> you<00:04:50.309> get<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.639> flashhider

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
then you get the flashhider

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.390 
then you get the flashhider
getting<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.199> way<00:04:52.319> not<00:04:52.919> really<00:04:52.949> worth<00:04:53.249> it

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
getting in the way not really worth it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.549 
getting in the way not really worth it
at<00:04:53.520> all<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.089> on<00:04:54.210> top<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.599> it<00:04:55.229> makes

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:55.559 
at all and on top of that it makes

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.499 
at all and on top of that it makes
mounting<00:04:56.039> a<00:04:56.129> battery<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.819> difficult<00:04:57.389> in

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
mounting a battery really difficult in

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.439 
mounting a battery really difficult in
this<00:04:57.659> I've<00:04:58.229> already<00:04:58.800> sliced<00:04:59.219> two<00:05:00.089> of<00:05:00.300> my

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
this I've already sliced two of my

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.409 
this I've already sliced two of my
lipo's<00:05:00.930> wires<00:05:01.289> by<00:05:02.159> trying<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.909> mount<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.300> in

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
lipo's wires by trying to mount it in

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.510 
lipo's wires by trying to mount it in
here<00:05:03.689> and<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.199> got<00:05:04.289> caught<00:05:04.559> there's<00:05:04.860> not

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
here and it just got caught there's not

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.249 
here and it just got caught there's not
enough<00:05:05.729> room<00:05:05.939> because<00:05:06.689> of<00:05:06.839> those<00:05:06.990> two

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
enough room because of those two

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.890 
enough room because of those two
features<00:05:07.499> so<00:05:08.009> what<00:05:08.159> I<00:05:08.189> recommend<00:05:08.309> the<00:05:08.639> gun

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
features so what I recommend the gun

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.089 
features so what I recommend the gun
definitely<00:05:09.900> if<00:05:10.199> you<00:05:10.259> get<00:05:10.439> into<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.860> sport

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
definitely if you get into the sport

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.739 
definitely if you get into the sport
especially<00:05:11.309> and<00:05:11.909> you<00:05:12.089> want<00:05:12.270> something<00:05:12.479> that's

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
especially and you want something that's

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.659 
especially and you want something that's
not<00:05:12.960> going<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.289> break<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:13.529> bank<00:05:13.889> but<00:05:14.249> also<00:05:14.400> is

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
not going to break the bank but also is

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.610 
not going to break the bank but also is
you<00:05:14.909> know<00:05:14.999> more<00:05:15.210> reliable<00:05:15.870> than<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.110> chinese

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
you know more reliable than the chinese

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.029 
you know more reliable than the chinese
jg<00:05:17.249> stuff<00:05:17.719> definitely<00:05:18.719> go<00:05:19.199> with<00:05:19.409> this<00:05:19.589> I<00:05:19.830> think

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
jg stuff definitely go with this I think

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.129 
jg stuff definitely go with this I think
it's<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.370> very<00:05:20.580> reliable<00:05:20.999> gun<00:05:21.509> it's<00:05:21.930> very

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
it's a very reliable gun it's very
