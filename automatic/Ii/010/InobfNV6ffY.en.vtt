the line can be detected using this dr
and<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.690> working<00:01:40.310> now<00:01:41.310> we

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and now we can see the working now we

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.160 
and now we can see the working now we
will<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.940> working<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.810> project<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
will see the working of this project so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.800 
will see the working of this project so
for<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> connect<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
for that we have to connect this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:02:14.350 
for that we have to connect this
connection<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.440> the<00:02:07.369> power<00:02:08.369> now

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.330 

if<00:02:15.360> there<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.720> no<00:02:15.959> crack<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.769> means<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.160> there

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
if there is no crack that means if there

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.500 
if there is no crack that means if there
is<00:02:17.489> no<00:02:17.670> crack<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.739> see<00:02:19.950> about<00:02:20.250> Rod<00:02:20.489> God<00:02:21.299> is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
is no crack you can see about Rod God is

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.140 
is no crack you can see about Rod God is
running<00:02:24.290> there<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.410> no<00:02:25.590> crack<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.040> our<00:02:26.850> bot

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
running there is no crack then our bot

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.340 
running there is no crack then our bot
will<00:02:27.360> run<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.739> any<00:02:28.890> crack<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:31.140> will

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
will run if there is any crack it will

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.240 
will run if there is any crack it will
deduct<00:02:31.620> because<00:02:32.269> our<00:02:33.269> LDR<00:02:33.870> will<00:02:34.709> detect<00:02:35.010> that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
deduct because our LDR will detect that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.240 
deduct because our LDR will detect that
led<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.890> detect<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.570> crack<00:02:39.570> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
led so that it will detect the crack and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.770 
led so that it will detect the crack and
start<00:02:41.250> sending<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.480> summers<00:02:44.510> through<00:02:45.510> over

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
start sending the summers through over

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.449 
start sending the summers through over
GSM<00:02:46.290> modem<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.890> will<00:02:47.040> send<00:02:47.250> SMS<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:49.459> connect

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
GSM modem it will send SMS to connect

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.680 
GSM modem it will send SMS to connect
GSM<00:02:50.910> modem<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:53.579> connect<00:02:53.910> GSM<00:02:54.269> modem<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.600> have

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
GSM modem to connect GSM modem you have

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.550 
GSM modem to connect GSM modem you have
to<00:02:54.810> connect<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.170> 12<00:02:56.010> volt<00:02:56.280> supply<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:58.320> once

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
to connect this 12 volt supply so once

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.729 
to connect this 12 volt supply so once
it<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.769> once<00:02:59.610> if<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.970> connected<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
it is once if it is connected and the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.740 
it is once if it is connected and the
power<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.370> switched<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:04.130> then<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.459> see

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
power is switched on then you can see

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.580 
power is switched on then you can see
GSM<00:03:06.750> modem<00:03:06.900> light<00:03:07.680> flowing

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
GSM modem light flowing

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.510 
GSM modem light flowing
so<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.340> means<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:11.140> power<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.740> and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
so this means that the power is on and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.860 
so this means that the power is on and
it<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.790> searching<00:03:13.510> for<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.750> signal<00:03:15.870> once

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
it is searching for the signal once

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:32.380 
it is searching for the signal once
everything<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.470> fine

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.949 

so<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.599> if<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:35.099> is<00:03:35.129> any<00:03:35.360> crack<00:03:36.360> detected

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
so it is if there is any crack detected

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.259 
so it is if there is any crack detected
then<00:03:37.230> because<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.040> put<00:03:38.220> finger<00:03:38.849> like<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.030> so

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
then because I put finger like this so

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.150 
then because I put finger like this so
if<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:39.989> any<00:03:40.170> crack<00:03:40.379> detected<00:03:40.830> then<00:03:41.010> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
if there is any crack detected then it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.650 
if there is any crack detected then it
will<00:03:41.660> then<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:45.180> will<00:03:45.360> send<00:03:45.569> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
will then it will it will send the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
will then it will it will send the
message<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.709> will<00:03:46.739> stop<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.280> vehicle

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
message and it will stop the vehicle

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.680
