00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.320
 to start we have to do we are your bronze voice that sell the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.320
 eyes seen where they sell things for 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.249
 entertainment can be copper the brave selectable by sight all 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.359
 consulted pointed out 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
 to weld them half an inch from each territory 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.939
 I think it helped me put the groups together for the flat and round needles 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.980
 of different measures 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 it occurs with more than 20 years 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.460
 now to be the rod has always been felt 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.640
 the psychologist to put her vomited was left armor 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.810
 all that can be improvised the floors are used old bought in the yard 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.480
 one 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.790
 old workshop 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.860
 you do not need to buy fine things we just do not go practices that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.180
 you can use them once finished and curious that you define the only 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 where he has been so there is no movement 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.420
 when working on this list 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.180
 now closings have to get the improvised and some buy now 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.520
 made 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.700
 the aspin felt the milestone for the city to avoid that they finish with the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.730
 fingers 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.780
 i the pen for captive soldier 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.950
 the sheets sell in loose groups and that's to be sweeter the aluminum and the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.160
 improvised putting soldier on a rod to separate the waters 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 As I said to you, Teflon hard shoulders 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.770
 and he that's important you have to look for a number 3 wake the measurements 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.980
 proposals for if this happens with academics to be fine lines 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.710
 kings made different 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 and very important a magnifying glass for tonight that both needles 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.729
 and this is a notice in which improvise live the facts of wood com 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.440
 screws 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.600
 to release 16 several at the same time 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.680
 in this sense is one of the best killers will paralyze selmeczi dable 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.690
 but it is highly toxic you have to be very careful with your eyes hands 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.649
 mouth 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.389
 to check the shoes again after removing in the mouth they have to 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.379
 be sterilized 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.650
 and thus accumulate 16 rods and laments most of the Chinese who 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.930
 sell, we can swim, you can put one, you are 16 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.899
 this sir how long 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.579
 in fact several weeks in different sizes and perlora to release them all 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.829
 I already have a certain measure mark 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.309
 they are the same size and very important welding that is lead-free 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.539
 lead is highly toxic tombs hinduists will also not fall into the 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.229
 blood and then decontaminate people 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.659
 queue to be the groups 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.079
 youlus your sevens 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.269
 is my line is usually always have to be sitting well couple 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.299
 down because couples 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.299
 that is already wet born in the top 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.859
 they let go 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.389
 but you have to be careful not to leave on board is also because to the 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.459
 time to run in the tube is not good and this is the most important the emphasis 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.919
 I'm in this 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.329
 Be careful not to damage the needles if there is no case, it is not working so much 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.669
 time for the internal damages to be disrupted and thrown away without waste 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.619
 and be careful with your fingers this no more because you do not leave many boards and always 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 you have to leave a bit 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.969
 I do not know a quarter of an inch less 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.609
 we do not lower the commoner so that the needles that see 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.790
 in free spaces so that the ink flows freely not 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.340
 and to make them plan to your 2010 sun of 9 I usually like 9 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.569
 kenton said that sirte parejitas in the part of the tip so they are not 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.709
 uneven 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.569
 steve stricker like those of the watercolor watercolor kioto then you have to have 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.639
 watch out 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.839
 are always giving with it has been first and then welding at the beginning a 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.719
 spy is a bit cold 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.959
 you can stop them and this is a flat 9 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.959
 many people like the planes too 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.479
 we said is to let go a little more making sure they are aligned 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.240
 all right 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.740
 those are the actions that decide another part of the medium 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.840
 now if you want them more mundane children always theirs folded from 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.789
 different can charge 2 or 3 times defending the space you want 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.199
 leave on the needles and this needle probe to wash and it's my space 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.600
 if they came out from between the needles and the team without playing together 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.689
 and four above 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.529
 it is the space the only one gets 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.829
 and once they separate they get into the middle level of the needles 

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:53.870
 keep the space open 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.289
 a lot of people say 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.330
 pepÃ­n appointments to prepare them to make the space smaller but city depending 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.099
 of the thickness of aluminum the separation of the couple 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.279
 and again at the top 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.099
 with the field 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.680
 and lead-free solder 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.950
 it proceeds to release also leaving with -1 eighths of an inch 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.059
 free so that latitudes can flow 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.959
 if one leaves very fat because on the other hand it will not set the couple bidding on the 

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.180
 tube and that's going to cause problems 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.050
 once it is done and that even the mother 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 yes 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.550
 sometimes you get a little open the closed doors 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.240
 with the tweezers 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180
 also sometimes it is that these are a little 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.779
 to solder the several hours and 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.899
 you have to be very careful about the fat of your fingers can cause the 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.620
 needles do not foresee winds in the itv 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.040
 and how I love you and a certain measure of needles does not matter 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.340
 just make sure you weld that around the rod very well 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.969
 so that the bag does not peel off and sweden 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.849
 way than working with them 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.689
 Perez in the first manga 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.969
 Telecinco as welding to make it look good is 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.039
 is that once the finished ones usually always 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.409
 do not think it's too perfect without a roof and barefoot something 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.249
 but but what you can do is be screaming the telescope teletypes 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.599
 then this in a lot of detail 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.379
 in a few seconds in the same say but be careful if you return nothing more to 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.379
 straighten the finances more milk 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.990
 together once she's done that, she proceeds to wash the 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.939
 and usually they demanded the tapes whenever they check the farms 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.550
 nacho and misinform the skin 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.830
 Juan Manuel Guillen has to apply in the city 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.880
 that you can visit in the productive fabric your tiliches 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.869
 I am 20 years old with this box and he has always been highly separated 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:58.939
 corrosive be careful 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.180
 be very careful with that 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.889
 Hope this can help you
