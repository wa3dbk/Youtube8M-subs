before<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.679> PCO<00:00:14.429> came<00:00:15.389> along<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.990> used<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
before the PCO came along we used to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.099 
before the PCO came along we used to
hire<00:00:16.529> cars<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.310> other<00:00:17.640> hire<00:00:18.029> companies<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
hire cars from other hire companies and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
hire cars from other hire companies and
the<00:00:20.010> costs<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.730> very<00:00:22.310> extortionate<00:00:23.390> when<00:00:24.390> we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the costs was very extortionate when we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
the costs was very extortionate when we
build<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> client<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.859> weren't

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
build out to the client we weren't

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
build out to the client we weren't
making<00:00:26.400> any<00:00:26.849> money<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.449> were<00:00:27.689> just

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
making any money but we were just

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
making any money but we were just
keeping<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> client<00:00:28.590> happy<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.730> when

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
keeping the client happy and then when

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
keeping the client happy and then when
the<00:00:30.029> PCI<00:00:30.510> licensing<00:00:31.380> laws<00:00:31.710> came<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.399> force

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the PCI licensing laws came into force

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
the PCI licensing laws came into force
we<00:00:32.940> realized<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> market<00:00:34.350> for

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
we realized that there was a market for

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
we realized that there was a market for
renting<00:00:35.399> our<00:00:35.579> PCO<00:00:35.969> class<00:00:36.239> suppose<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> most

renting our PCO class suppose the most

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
renting our PCO class suppose the most
obvious<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> service<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.640> provide<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
obvious and service that we provide is a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
obvious and service that we provide is a
replacement<00:00:40.200> vehicle<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> event<00:00:41.520> their

chauffeurs unthought enough to have
their<00:00:43.050> own<00:00:43.170> vehicle<00:00:43.559> break<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.190> be

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
their own vehicle break down I would be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
their own vehicle break down I would be
off<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> road<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:45.030> any<00:00:45.300> reason<00:00:45.719> perhaps

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
off the road for any reason perhaps

00:00:45.870 --> 00:01:04.810 
off the road for any reason perhaps
maintenance<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.559> something<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.920> that

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.300 

a<00:01:04.870> lot<00:01:05.870> of<00:01:05.900> chauffeurs<00:01:06.440> perhaps<00:01:06.830> wouldn't

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
a lot of chauffeurs perhaps wouldn't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.010 
a lot of chauffeurs perhaps wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.420> fact<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.870> they

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
necessarily think of the fact that they

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.190 
necessarily think of the fact that they
can<00:01:09.260> advertise<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.670> know<00:01:11.200> different

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
can advertise you know different

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
vehicles on their own fleet so maybe

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.690 
vehicles on their own fleet so maybe
they<00:01:14.270> have<00:01:14.480> only<00:01:14.720> have<00:01:15.050> an<00:01:15.500> e<00:01:15.620> class<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.580> they

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
they have only have an e class but they

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.360 
they have only have an e class but they
could<00:01:16.910> promote<00:01:17.120> you<00:01:17.720> know<00:01:17.750> using<00:01:18.290> us<00:01:18.800> as<00:01:19.160> their

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.160 

we<00:01:34.659> have<00:01:35.020> checked<00:01:35.770> sheets<00:01:36.100> not<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.359> when<00:01:37.929> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
we have checked sheets not just when the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.690 
we have checked sheets not just when the
big<00:01:38.380> was<00:01:38.590> come<00:01:38.829> back<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.250> when<00:01:39.340> they<00:01:39.460> go<00:01:39.640> away

big was come back and when they go away

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.569 
big was come back and when they go away
but<00:01:40.000> we<00:01:40.149> also<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:41.530> series<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.069> checks<00:01:42.399> that

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
but we also have a series of checks that

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.490 
but we also have a series of checks that
are<00:01:42.729> done<00:01:43.030> on<00:01:43.329> a<00:01:43.359> regular<00:01:43.569> basis<00:01:44.259> for

ourselves so that we go through and we

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.359 
ourselves so that we go through and we
check<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:46.840> know<00:01:46.869> how<00:01:47.200> clean<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.740> interiors
