video<00:00:12.389> kind<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.840> came<00:00:12.990> up<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.500> found

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
video kind of came up because I found

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.099 
video kind of came up because I found
that<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.519> not<00:00:14.820> been<00:00:15.150> paying<00:00:15.360> attention<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
that I have not been paying attention to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.040 
that I have not been paying attention to
orbs<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> light<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.190> yes<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.150> ran<00:00:18.420> across<00:00:18.720> them

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
orbs of light and yes I ran across them

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
orbs of light and yes I ran across them
a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.529> game<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.039> i<00:00:20.100> think<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.670> i<00:00:20.820> was

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
a lot in the game but i think that i was

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
a lot in the game but i think that i was
still<00:00:21.300> overlooking<00:00:22.080> their<00:00:22.230> real<00:00:22.470> importance

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
still overlooking their real importance

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
still overlooking their real importance
they<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.880> closely<00:00:24.269> tied<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they are closely tied in with one of the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.769 
they are closely tied in with one of the
core<00:00:25.769> mechanics<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.699> gameplay<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> destiny

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
core mechanics of gameplay and destiny

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.620 
core mechanics of gameplay and destiny
and<00:00:27.900> that's<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.410> supers<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:30.000> supers<00:00:30.420> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and that's the supers and the supers are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
and that's the supers and the supers are
closely<00:00:30.900> related<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> intellect<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.309> your

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
closely related to the intellect on your

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.540 
closely related to the intellect on your
character<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> big<00:00:34.770> layer<00:00:35.219> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
character and there is a big layer of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
character and there is a big layer of
teamwork<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.600> strategy<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.680> goes<00:00:37.860> into

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
teamwork and strategy that goes into

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
teamwork and strategy that goes into
this<00:00:38.250> mechanic<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.360> overlooked

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this mechanic that I think is overlooked

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
this mechanic that I think is overlooked
at<00:00:40.290> times<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.219> that's<00:00:41.370> why<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.790> touch

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
at times so that's why I want to touch

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.170 
at times so that's why I want to touch
on<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> today<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.260> video<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.670> let's<00:00:44.700> get

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
on it today on this video so let's get

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.430 
on it today on this video so let's get
started<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.570> talking<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.140> things

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
started by talking about some things

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
started by talking about some things
that<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> probably<00:00:46.860> already<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that you probably already know but I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.959 
that you probably already know but I
think<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.660> said<00:00:48.960> orbs<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.070> light<00:00:50.129> give

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
think have to be said orbs of light give

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
think have to be said orbs of light give
you<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.329> super<00:00:51.780> faster<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> gives<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you your super faster it gives you a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
you your super faster it gives you a
percentage<00:00:53.309> based<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.329> intellect

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
percentage based on how much intellect

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
percentage based on how much intellect
you<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> few<00:00:56.789> mechanics

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you have now there is a few mechanics

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
you have now there is a few mechanics
that<00:00:57.300> govern<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.289> affects<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.980> it's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that govern how this affects you it's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.660 
that govern how this affects you it's
based<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.960> quality<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> orb<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
based on the quality of the orb and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
based on the quality of the orb and
usually<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.359> based<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.439> was

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
usually that's based on how it was

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
usually that's based on how it was
obtained<00:01:05.070> most<00:01:05.820> Guardians<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.750> seeing

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
obtained most Guardians will be seeing

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
obtained most Guardians will be seeing
their<00:01:07.200> super<00:01:07.590> around<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> four-minute<00:01:08.729> mark

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
their super around the four-minute mark

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
their super around the four-minute mark
if<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.689> anything<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.350> few<00:01:10.920> kills

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
if they don't do anything a few kills

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.560 
if they don't do anything a few kills
here<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
here and there is going to get you that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
here and there is going to get you that
that's<00:01:12.780> why<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> most<00:01:13.350> prominent<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:14.130> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that's why the most prominent time for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.580 
that's why the most prominent time for
supers<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> crucible<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
supers in the crucible is around the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.700 
supers in the crucible is around the
nine-minute<00:01:17.159> mark<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.930> PvE<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.409> usually

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
nine-minute mark in PvE you usually

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
nine-minute mark in PvE you usually
gonna<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.490> super<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.540> often

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
gonna see your super a lot more often

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
gonna see your super a lot more often
because<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> things<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> kill

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
because there's a lot of things to kill

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
because there's a lot of things to kill
now<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.509> more<00:01:24.840> intellect<00:01:25.439> there

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
now if you have more intellect there

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
now if you have more intellect there
it's<00:01:26.040> something<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.549> also<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> give

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it's something that's also going to give

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's something that's also going to give
you<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.509> super<00:01:27.900> faster<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.759> get

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you your super faster now if you get

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.020 
you your super faster now if you get
your<00:01:30.000> super<00:01:30.540> based<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.110> time<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.610> orbs

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
your super based on time then your orbs

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
your super based on time then your orbs
they're<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> anything<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
they're not going to have anything in

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
they're not going to have anything in
them<00:01:34.680> however<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> feed<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
them however if you feed them with the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
them however if you feed them with the
energy<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.320> prey<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.680> whoever<00:01:38.220> you're

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
energy of your prey or whoever you're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
energy of your prey or whoever you're
killing<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.869> orbs<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> be

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
killing then your orbs are going to be

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
killing then your orbs are going to be
infused<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.610> energy<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.479> going

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
infused with more energy and it's going

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
infused with more energy and it's going

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
to pay out higher for all your teammates

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.660 
to pay out higher for all your teammates
it<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> mechanic<00:01:46.470> where<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.430> are

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it also has a mechanic where if you are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
it also has a mechanic where if you are
producing<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.110> pick<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.649> from

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
producing or then you pick them up from

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980 
producing or then you pick them up from
somebody<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.610> them<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.149> yourself

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
somebody that got them from yourself

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
somebody that got them from yourself
from<00:01:52.710> another<00:01:52.920> super<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> had<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.700> going

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
from another super you had there's going

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
from another super you had there's going
to<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.939> diminished<00:01:54.479> returns<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to be diminished returns and that's to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.230 
to be diminished returns and that's to
make<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.280> harder<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.850> supers

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
make it a little bit harder for supers

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.590 
make it a little bit harder for supers
to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.450> chained<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:59.159> PvE<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
to be chained now in PvE I think this is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.260 
to be chained now in PvE I think this is
well<00:02:00.750> balanced<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.530> PvP<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.060> much

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
well balanced over in PvP not as much

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.670 
well balanced over in PvP not as much
and<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> needs<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.259> looked<00:02:04.439> at

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and I think it needs to be looked at

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.999 
and I think it needs to be looked at
because<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.610> allows<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.020> exploits<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.680> here

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
because it allows for exploits like here

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
because it allows for exploits like here
we<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.340> two<00:02:08.580> Titans<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.209> weren't<00:02:09.450> even

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we have two Titans we weren't even

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059 
we have two Titans we weren't even
planning<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.140> anything<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.039> just

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
planning on anything like this it just

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.660 
planning on anything like this it just
kind<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> worked<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> done

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
kind of worked out because it's a done

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.410 
kind of worked out because it's a done
no<00:02:12.880> effect<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.860> PvP<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.310> something<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.240> can

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
no effect in PvP it's something that can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
no effect in PvP it's something that can
really<00:02:16.840> take<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.349> team<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.770> next<00:02:18.040> level

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
really take your team to the next level

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.490 
really take your team to the next level
in<00:02:18.520> PvE<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:19.690> something<00:02:20.020> that's<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> let

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
in PvE at something that's going to let

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.250 
in PvE at something that's going to let
you<00:02:20.680> fly<00:02:21.190> through<00:02:21.550> strikes<00:02:22.060> if<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.230> a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
you fly through strikes if you have a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.080 
you fly through strikes if you have a
team<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.620> knows<00:02:24.130> what<00:02:24.400> they're<00:02:24.550> doing<00:02:24.730> in

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
team that knows what they're doing in

team that knows what they're doing in
the<00:02:25.239> sense<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.930> put<00:02:26.709> your<00:02:26.830> intellect<00:02:27.400> up

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
the sense that you put your intellect up

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.990 
the sense that you put your intellect up
you<00:02:28.030> put<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.599> perks<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.319> produce<00:02:29.470> orbs<00:02:30.280> you

you put on perks that produce orbs you
put<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:32.220> armor<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> gives<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.700> extra<00:02:34.030> orbs

instead<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.810> eight<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.470> pump

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
instead of eight you can actually pump

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.790 
instead of eight you can actually pump
out<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> app<00:02:36.310> up<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.060> nine<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.590> all

then you're gonna be able to chain your
supers<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> lot<00:02:50.890> better<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.519> it's<00:02:51.760> gonna<00:02:51.940> not

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
supers a lot better and it's gonna not

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it's actually a lot more fun because who

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.590 
it's actually a lot more fun because who

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
want to see less orbs because then

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.390 
want to see less orbs because then
everyone<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:26.859> limited<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.280> a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
boat three supers a game and it's not

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.680 
boat three supers a game and it's not
going<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.859> get<00:03:29.920> out<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.190> hand<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.299> lot

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
going to get out of hand there is a lot

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.210 
going to get out of hand there is a lot
of<00:03:31.750> ways<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.049> this<00:03:32.410> can<00:03:32.560> be<00:03:32.709> balanced<00:03:33.190> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
of ways that this can be balanced and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.580 
of ways that this can be balanced and
with<00:03:33.400> Inferno<00:03:33.820> mode<00:03:34.150> coming<00:03:34.780> out<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.230> think

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
with Inferno mode coming out I think

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.500 
with Inferno mode coming out I think
orbs<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.220> light<00:03:36.280> need<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.820> be<00:03:36.940> looked<00:03:37.209> at<00:03:37.359> again

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
orbs of light need to be looked at again

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.449 
orbs of light need to be looked at again
and<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:38.769> can<00:03:38.920> all<00:03:39.040> agree<00:03:39.100> that

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
and I think that we can all agree that

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.539 
and I think that we can all agree that
having<00:03:39.850> three<00:03:40.390> Titans<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> team

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
having three Titans on a team

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.160 
having three Titans on a team
continuously<00:03:42.549> making<00:03:42.850> orbs<00:03:43.299> for<00:03:43.510> gunslingers

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
continuously making orbs for gunslingers

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.229 
continuously making orbs for gunslingers
or<00:03:44.320> warlocks<00:03:44.859> whatever<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.310> case<00:03:45.519> may<00:03:45.730> be<00:03:45.760> is

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
or warlocks whatever the case may be is

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.630 
or warlocks whatever the case may be is
a<00:03:46.299> little<00:03:46.720> bit<00:03:46.840> overpowered<00:03:47.590> that's<00:03:48.310> why<00:03:48.579> it

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
a little bit overpowered that's why it

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000 
a little bit overpowered that's why it
may<00:03:48.850> be<00:03:48.910> nice<00:03:49.209> at<00:03:49.510> least<00:03:49.540> an<00:03:49.959> inferno<00:03:50.440> mode<00:03:50.769> to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
may be nice at least an inferno mode to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.830 
may be nice at least an inferno mode to
see<00:03:51.220> some<00:03:51.489> way<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.700> cap<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.420> amount<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.750> energy

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
see some way to cap the amount of energy

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.590 
see some way to cap the amount of energy
you<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.380> get<00:03:53.590> from<00:03:53.859> orbs<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.340> light<00:03:54.600> because

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
you can get from orbs of light because

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.449 
you can get from orbs of light because
what<00:03:55.900> ends<00:03:56.049> up<00:03:56.170> happening<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:56.829> if<00:03:57.190> there

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
what ends up happening is that if there

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.699 
what ends up happening is that if there
is<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.670> strategy<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.870> completely

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
is a strategy that is completely

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.710 
is a strategy that is completely
dominant<00:04:00.370> you're<00:04:00.940> not<00:04:01.209> going<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.480> see<00:04:01.600> any

kind of innovation that kind of takes

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.340

away<00:04:03.579> from<00:04:03.880> what<00:04:04.269> orbs<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.870> light<00:04:04.930> can<00:04:05.290> be

away from what orbs of light can be

away from what orbs of light can be
which<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> case<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.340> destiny<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.329> that

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
which in the case of destiny is that

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.199 
which in the case of destiny is that
extra<00:04:08.079> dynamic<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:09.010> adds<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.850> strategy

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
extra dynamic that adds to the strategy

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.349 
extra dynamic that adds to the strategy
the<00:04:10.720> teamwork<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.590> skill<00:04:12.010> cap<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.670> I<00:04:13.120> just

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
the teamwork the skill cap and I just

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.819 
the teamwork the skill cap and I just
don't<00:04:13.600> want<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.840> see<00:04:14.079> something<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.590> can<00:04:14.799> be

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
don't want to see something that can be

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.940 
don't want to see something that can be
so<00:04:15.310> good<00:04:15.609> for<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.880> game<00:04:16.150> actually<00:04:17.079> break<00:04:17.739> it

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
so good for a game actually break it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.789 
so good for a game actually break it
when<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.060> comes<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.539> PVE<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.109> think<00:04:20.470> we<00:04:20.560> can<00:04:20.680> all

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
when it comes to PVE I think we can all

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.830 
when it comes to PVE I think we can all
agree<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.190> there<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.729> plenty<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.360> super

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
agree that there is plenty of super

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.720 
agree that there is plenty of super
energy<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.320> come<00:04:23.500> around<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.250> are<00:04:24.370> playing

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
energy to come around if you are playing

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.420 
energy to come around if you are playing
with<00:04:24.970> your<00:04:25.120> strike<00:04:25.510> team<00:04:25.540> properly<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:27.040> makes

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
with your strike team properly it makes

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 
with your strike team properly it makes
for<00:04:27.610> some<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.000> best<00:04:28.330> rounds<00:04:28.840> in<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.110> game

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
for some of the best rounds in this game

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.160 
for some of the best rounds in this game
I<00:04:29.770> have<00:04:30.100> found<00:04:30.340> now<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.300> actually<00:04:31.690> pay

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
I have found now that I actually pay

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.890 
I have found now that I actually pay
attention<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.740> how<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.040> use<00:04:33.430> my<00:04:33.610> super<00:04:34.060> where

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
attention to how I use my super where

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.630 
attention to how I use my super where
I'm<00:04:35.050> going<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.290> be<00:04:35.410> getting<00:04:35.680> my<00:04:35.800> orbs<00:04:36.220> making

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
I'm going to be getting my orbs making

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.210 
I'm going to be getting my orbs making
sure<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.120> have<00:04:37.150> access<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.320> lot<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.590> kills

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
sure I have access to a lot of kills

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.790 
sure I have access to a lot of kills
just<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.300> we<00:04:40.420> can<00:04:40.570> continuously<00:04:41.140> build<00:04:41.590> on<00:04:41.770> our

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
just so we can continuously build on our

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.040 
just so we can continuously build on our
supers<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.790> make<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> going<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.630> little<00:04:43.870> bit

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
supers and make the going a little bit

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.350 
supers and make the going a little bit
easier<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.830> we<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:45.160> try<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.520> be<00:04:45.730> personal

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
easier and we can try to be personal

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.420 
easier and we can try to be personal
records<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.900> how<00:04:47.170> many<00:04:47.410> enemies<00:04:47.860> we<00:04:48.040> kill<00:04:48.280> with
