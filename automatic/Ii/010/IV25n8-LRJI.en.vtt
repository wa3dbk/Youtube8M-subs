00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
one dollar at all varies but if you know
it's<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> work<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> you're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it's not that much of work and you're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.749 
it's not that much of work and you're
guaranteed<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.880> least<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.330> cent<00:01:24.740> so

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
guaranteed to get at least one cent so

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
guaranteed to get at least one cent so
that's<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> benefit<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:27.750> pretty

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that's the benefit and that's pretty

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.640 
that's the benefit and that's pretty
much<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.380> safe<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:29.130> money<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.650> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
much a safe way to get money and the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
much a safe way to get money and the
downside<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.579> only<00:01:32.700> spin<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> wheel

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
downside is you can only spin the wheel

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.330 
downside is you can only spin the wheel
three<00:01:33.509> times<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> day<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.950> comes<00:01:35.130> quite

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
three times a day and it comes quite

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
three times a day and it comes quite
often<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.790> usually<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.479> within<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
often so usually get that within the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
often so usually get that within the
first<00:01:37.020> five<00:01:37.200> searches<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.820> money<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
first five searches or so the money that
