how to make a drop-down or pop-up menu

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.090 
how to make a drop-down or pop-up menu
using<00:00:11.580> fireworks<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.870> ability<00:00:13.590> division<00:00:13.890> Fox

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
using fireworks the ability division Fox

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.320 
using fireworks the ability division Fox
is<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.340> quite<00:00:14.580> good<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.060> have<00:00:15.090> to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
is really quite good because you have to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
is really quite good because you have to
do<00:00:15.420> any<00:00:15.570> coding<00:00:15.870> at<00:00:16.049> all<00:00:16.289> fireworks<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
do any coding at all fireworks will you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.400 
do any coding at all fireworks will you
know<00:00:18.330> through<00:00:18.510> their<00:00:18.599> interface<00:00:19.080> allow<00:00:19.349> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
know through their interface allow you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.859 
know through their interface allow you
to<00:00:19.500> create<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.770> pop-up<00:00:20.130> menu<00:00:20.390> customize<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to create a pop-up menu customize it and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
to create a pop-up menu customize it and
then<00:00:22.230> export<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.860> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.430> build

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
then export it so you can then build

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.609 
then export it so you can then build
your<00:00:24.180> website<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.020> integrate<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
your website around it or integrate it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519 
your website around it or integrate it
into<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.490> website<00:00:26.940> that<00:00:27.029> you're<00:00:27.150> building<00:00:27.529> so

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
into a website that you're building so

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.680 
into a website that you're building so
we're<00:00:28.710> using<00:00:28.860> fireworks<00:00:29.820> cs4<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.600> this

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
we're using fireworks cs4 in this

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.619 
we're using fireworks cs4 in this
example<00:00:31.020> but<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.619> interface<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:33.570> much

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
example but the interface is pretty much

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.090 
example but the interface is pretty much
the<00:00:33.750> same<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.020> quite<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> few<00:00:34.710> previous

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the same on quite a few previous

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889 
the same on quite a few previous
versions<00:00:35.519> of<00:00:35.579> fireworks<00:00:35.999> and<00:00:36.089> right<00:00:36.390> back<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
versions of fireworks and right back to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
versions of fireworks and right back to
MX<00:00:37.409> 2004<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.839> to<00:00:39.960> build

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
MX 2004 so the way I'm going to build

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
MX 2004 so the way I'm going to build
this<00:00:40.379> pop-up<00:00:40.739> menus<00:00:41.069> I've<00:00:41.249> essentially<00:00:41.550> got

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this pop-up menus I've essentially got

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
this pop-up menus I've essentially got
two<00:00:41.969> states<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.629> I've<00:00:42.719> made<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.379> Photoshop

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
two states that I've made in Photoshop

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.090 
two states that I've made in Photoshop
I've<00:00:44.370> saved<00:00:44.909> web<00:00:45.149> two<00:00:45.359> gifts<00:00:45.859> you've<00:00:46.859> got<00:00:46.979> the

I've saved web two gifts you've got the
Upstate<00:00:47.609> as<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.819> can<00:00:47.909> see<00:00:48.089> here<00:00:48.389> and<00:00:48.690> then

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
Upstate as you can see here and then

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.889 
Upstate as you can see here and then
you've<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:49.799> the<00:00:49.889> overstate<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> sort

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you've got the overstate which is a sort

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.599 
you've got the overstate which is a sort
of<00:00:51.989> red<00:00:52.530> version<00:00:52.799> so<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.429> to<00:00:53.460> do

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
of red version so what I'm going to do

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.489 
of red version so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.389> the<00:00:54.510> navigation<00:00:54.749> I'm<00:00:55.109> also<00:00:55.229> going<00:00:55.409> to

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
is with the navigation I'm also going to

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.729 
is with the navigation I'm also going to
do<00:00:55.559> rollovers<00:00:56.069> for<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.309> normal<00:00:56.929> tabs<00:00:57.929> so<00:00:58.530> all

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
do rollovers for the normal tabs so all

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.559 
do rollovers for the normal tabs so all
I've<00:00:58.859> done<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.010> I've<00:00:59.159> created<00:00:59.249> a<00:00:59.639> new<00:00:59.999> state

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
I've done is I've created a new state

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.109 
I've done is I've created a new state
and<00:01:00.749> I've<00:01:01.409> dragged<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> second<00:01:02.760> gift<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
and I've dragged in the second gift to

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.710 
and I've dragged in the second gift to
essentially<00:01:03.629> creped<00:01:03.869> two<00:01:04.350> different<00:01:05.129> states

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
essentially creped two different states

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
essentially creped two different states
what<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.840> venden<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.470> using<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.040> slice<00:01:08.610> tool

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
what I'm venden is using the slice tool

what I'm venden is using the slice tool
which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> over<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> Left<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.580> have

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

which is over here on the Left I have
created<00:01:12.260> slices<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.410> all<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.800> buttons<00:01:14.250> on

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.510 
created slices for all of the buttons on
the<00:01:14.430> navigation<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.510> purely<00:01:15.900> by<00:01:16.520> dragging

the slice tool over each of the buttons
I'll<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.510> delete<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.830> one<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.040> next

to window at the top and then just make
sure<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.370> behaviour<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.910> ticked<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
sure your behaviour is ticked there and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
sure your behaviour is ticked there and
then<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.210> click<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.720> button<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.410> I'm

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then when you click a button all I'm

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.360 
then when you click a button all I'm
doing<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.860> adding<00:01:41.270> simple<00:01:42.270> rollover<00:01:43.370> adding

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
doing is adding simple rollover adding

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.399 
doing is adding simple rollover adding
simple<00:01:44.580> while<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> slices<00:01:45.930> will

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
simple while over to the slices will

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.580 
simple while over to the slices will
reveal<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.220> state<00:01:47.670> underneath<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.480> in<00:01:49.440> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
reveal the state underneath so in this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
reveal the state underneath so in this
case<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.310> only<00:01:50.490> disease<00:01:50.640> reveals<00:01:51.030> state<00:01:51.450> two

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
case the only disease reveals state two

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.580 
case the only disease reveals state two
which<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.050> red<00:01:52.260> rolled<00:01:53.100> over<00:01:53.310> version<00:01:54.590> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
which is the red rolled over version you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.300 
which is the red rolled over version you
can<00:01:55.740> use<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.010> preview<00:01:57.830> interface<00:01:58.830> over<00:01:59.159> here

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
can use the preview interface over here

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.070 
can use the preview interface over here
which<00:01:59.460> essentially<00:01:59.760> allows<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.659> view<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
which essentially allows you to view the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.580 
which essentially allows you to view the
rollovers<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> once<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> stage

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
rollovers so once you go to this stage

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.570 
rollovers so once you go to this stage
you're<00:02:04.979> ready<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.430> add<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.940> pop-up<00:02:06.750> menu<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
you're ready to add the pop-up menu so

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.040 
you're ready to add the pop-up menu so
let's<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.729> choose<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> button<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:09.750> an<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
let's just choose a button to do an so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170 
let's just choose a button to do an so
that's<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> say<00:02:10.500> page<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that's to say page one that's going to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.099 
that's to say page one that's going to
be<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.329> bottom<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.659> do<00:02:12.749> the<00:02:12.840> pop-up<00:02:13.079> menu

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
be the bottom then do the pop-up menu

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.790 
be the bottom then do the pop-up menu
one<00:02:13.379> then<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.709> go<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.859> modify<00:02:14.629> popup<00:02:15.629> menu<00:02:15.810> add

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.390 
menu and you get the pop-up menu editor
interface<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.990> happens<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.830> four<00:02:23.100> stages

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
interface so it happens in four stages

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000 
interface so it happens in four stages
content<00:02:24.030> appearance<00:02:24.420> advanced<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.140> position

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
content appearance advanced and position

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.310 
content appearance advanced and position
and<00:02:26.270> content<00:02:27.270> where<00:02:27.420> first<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.960> all<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.230> to

and content where first of all going to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290 
and content where first of all going to
add<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.710> pages<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> website<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
add the pages to the website so the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.540 
add the pages to the website so the
first<00:02:30.480> box<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.350> name<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.040> page<00:02:32.250> which

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
first box is the name of the page which

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.630 
first box is the name of the page which
is<00:02:32.670> services<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.720> case<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:35.130> link<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
is services one in this case the link is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
is services one in this case the link is
then<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> page<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> link<00:02:37.170> will<00:02:37.320> click

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
then the page that the link will click

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.120 
then the page that the link will click
through<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> say<00:02:38.840> page<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.680> dot

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
through to so as to say page one dot

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.190 
through to so as to say page one dot
HTML<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> don't<00:02:42.810> want<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.990> link<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
HTML and if you don't want to link to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.170 
HTML and if you don't want to link to
appear<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> same<00:02:44.550> window<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.000> put

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
appear in the same window you can put

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.410 
appear in the same window you can put
target<00:02:45.570> blank<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:45.960> example<00:02:47.120> let's<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.270> put

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
target blank for example let's just put

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.650 
target blank for example let's just put
a<00:02:48.450> few<00:02:48.630> more<00:02:48.690> pages<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> example<00:02:52.550> and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
a few more pages in for the example and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.070 
a few more pages in for the example and
so<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.960> three<00:02:55.530> let's<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.310> say<00:02:57.080> page

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
so this is three let's just say page

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.460 
so this is three let's just say page
three<00:02:58.410> dot<00:02:58.680> HTML<00:02:59.810> what<00:03:00.810> you'll<00:03:00.960> also<00:03:01.320> notice

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
three dot HTML what you'll also notice

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.700 
three dot HTML what you'll also notice
is<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> second<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:02.880> button<00:03:03.150> here

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
is this in the second little button here

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.820 
is this in the second little button here
which<00:03:04.710> if<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.250> click<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.880> will<00:03:05.940> indent

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
which if you click that it will indent

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.610 
which if you click that it will indent
the<00:03:08.240> link<00:03:09.240> which<00:03:09.570> will<00:03:09.780> essentially<00:03:10.050> create<00:03:10.170> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the link which will essentially create a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.090 
the link which will essentially create a
second<00:03:11.370> pop-up<00:03:11.970> menu<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.900> when<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.380> scroll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
second pop-up menu so when you scroll

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.590 
second pop-up menu so when you scroll
down<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> third<00:03:14.460> hop<00:03:14.640> menu<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.390> want<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
down the third hop menu and you want the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.810 
down the third hop menu and you want the
link<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.810> expand<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.320> have<00:03:16.440> further<00:03:16.710> links<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
link to expand to have further links you

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.910 
link to expand to have further links you
do<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.150> by<00:03:18.270> indenting<00:03:18.720> them<00:03:18.870> using<00:03:19.830> these

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
do that by indenting them using these

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.130 
do that by indenting them using these
two<00:03:20.070> buttons<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.460> and<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.600> indent<00:03:22.020> as

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
two buttons here and you can indent as

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140 
two buttons here and you can indent as
many<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.880> sensitive<00:03:23.880> could<00:03:24.030> come

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
many as you like so sensitive could come

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.449 
many as you like so sensitive could come
off<00:03:24.270> from<00:03:24.450> services<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:25.459> services

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
off from services one and then services

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.770 
off from services one and then services
three<00:03:26.640> could<00:03:26.850> come<00:03:27.000> off<00:03:27.090> from<00:03:27.209> services<00:03:27.570> two

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
three could come off from services two

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.150 
three could come off from services two
so<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.530> takes<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> little<00:03:28.770> bit<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.010> playing

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
so it takes a little bit of playing

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.320 
so it takes a little bit of playing
around<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.489> get<00:03:29.610> used<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.150> quite<00:03:30.300> a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
around to get used to but it's quite a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.740 
around to get used to but it's quite a
simple<00:03:30.570> system<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.320> use<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.450> also<00:03:33.570> use

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
simple system to use you can also use

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.540 
simple system to use you can also use
the<00:03:33.900> plus<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> minus<00:03:35.130> buttons<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.520> to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the plus and minus buttons here to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.970 
the plus and minus buttons here to
create<00:03:35.880> more<00:03:36.030> links<00:03:36.989> but<00:03:37.560> if<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:37.860> use

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
create more links but if you just use

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740 
create more links but if you just use
the<00:03:38.070> tablet<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.550> like<00:03:38.670> I've<00:03:38.760> been<00:03:39.060> then<00:03:39.300> it

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the tablet and like I've been then it

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.800 
the tablet and like I've been then it
will<00:03:39.840> keep<00:03:39.959> making<00:03:40.260> them<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.510> next<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:42.690> go

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
will keep making them for you next we go

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.960
