what forces are involved in shaping

what forces are involved in shaping
human<00:01:00.300> behavior<00:01:00.780> therefore<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.739> say<00:01:01.980> that's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
human behavior therefore they say that's

human behavior therefore they say that's

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
human nature that's where they're wrong

so<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> science<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> behavior<00:01:07.380> needs<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so the science of behavior needs to be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
so the science of behavior needs to be

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.060 
first and everything is going to be
secondary<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.480> that's<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.200> sad<00:02:20.440> reality<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
secondary and that's the sad reality of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.820 
secondary and that's the sad reality of
it<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.610> forty<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> fifty<00:02:22.390> percent<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
it the forty to fifty percent of the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.250 
it the forty to fifty percent of the
people<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.610> our<00:02:24.790> criminal<00:02:25.150> justice<00:02:25.180> system<00:02:25.510> or

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
people in our criminal justice system or

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.590 
people in our criminal justice system or
black<00:02:26.739> men<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.340> black<00:02:27.850> men<00:02:28.120> make<00:02:28.300> up<00:02:28.450> roughly

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
black men and black men make up roughly

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.720 
black men and black men make up roughly
five<00:02:28.959> percent<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.739> nation's<00:02:30.130> population

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
five percent of the nation's population

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.420 
five percent of the nation's population
and<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.810> think<00:02:32.019> people<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.830> discuss<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and I think people can discuss and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.370 
and I think people can discuss and
debate<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.760> causes<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.170> goes

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
debate the causes for that and this goes

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.340 
debate the causes for that and this goes
everything<00:02:35.650> from<00:02:35.890> institutional<00:02:36.489> racism

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
everything from institutional racism

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.140 
everything from institutional racism
policing<00:02:38.350> practices<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.090> think

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
policing practices and that but I think

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
policing practices and that but I think
at<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> end<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.750> day<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> all<00:02:41.110> boils<00:02:41.170> down

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
at the end of the day it all boils down

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.020 
at the end of the day it all boils down
to<00:02:41.890> class<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.519> think<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> reason

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
to class is I think that the reason

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.060 
to class is I think that the reason
racial<00:02:43.720> minorities<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.320> disproportionately

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
racial minorities are disproportionately

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.979 
racial minorities are disproportionately
incarcerated<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:46.299> because<00:02:46.690> they're<00:02:46.870> also

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
incarcerated is because they're also

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.320 
incarcerated is because they're also
disproportionately<00:02:47.470> poor

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.420
