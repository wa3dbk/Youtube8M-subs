so today we're going to take some of
these<00:00:03.689> Fink's<00:00:04.080> stalk<00:00:04.670> willow<00:00:05.670> leaf<00:00:05.910> figs

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
these Fink's stalk willow leaf figs

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.509 
these Fink's stalk willow leaf figs
and<00:00:07.350> we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.649> cut<00:00:07.859> them<00:00:08.010> back<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.490> of

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and we're going to cut them back out of

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.169 
and we're going to cut them back out of
their<00:00:08.849> training<00:00:09.360> pots<00:00:10.070> these<00:00:11.070> were<00:00:11.429> brought

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
their training pots these were brought

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.950 
their training pots these were brought
up<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:12.420> Florida<00:00:13.049> back<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:15.770> April<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:18.060> cut

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
up from Florida back in April and we cut

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.990 
up from Florida back in April and we cut
them<00:00:19.080> back<00:00:19.230> about<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> month<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.970> ago

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
them back about about a month or so ago

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660 
them back about about a month or so ago
and<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.810> time<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> knock

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and now it's time to go in and knock

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060 
and now it's time to go in and knock
them<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> these<00:00:24.210> pots<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.840> some<00:00:25.800> people

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
them out of these pots and some people

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
them out of these pots and some people
call<00:00:26.220> plating<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.880> actually<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.390> cut

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
call plating they actually will cut

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.450 
call plating they actually will cut
right<00:00:27.810> through<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> root<00:00:28.380> ball<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:29.189> why

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
right through the root ball that's why

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
right through the root ball that's why
we<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> sawzall<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.900> I'm<00:00:31.830> just

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we have the sawzall here so I'm just

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.319 
we have the sawzall here so I'm just
going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> pop<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> out<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.969> pot<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.329> then

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
going to pop it out of this pot and then

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.490 
going to pop it out of this pot and then
we<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.750> bang<00:00:37.230> off<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> soil<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
we just bang off a lot of this soil so I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:51.000 
we just bang off a lot of this soil so I
can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.250> working<00:00:41.610> with

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.530 

now<00:00:52.010> I'm<00:00:52.130> just<00:00:52.280> gonna<00:00:52.399> rake<00:00:52.700> it<00:00:52.850> down<00:00:53.059> with<00:00:53.329> my

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
now I'm just gonna rake it down with my

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.580 
now I'm just gonna rake it down with my
hook<00:00:53.809> here

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.780 

the<00:01:00.010> reason<00:01:00.340> why<00:01:00.490> we<00:01:00.640> do<00:01:00.820> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:02.530> because<00:01:02.860> we

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
the reason why we do this is because we

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.790 
the reason why we do this is because we
have<00:01:03.970> these<00:01:04.120> big<00:01:04.570> massive<00:01:04.809> root<00:01:05.290> balls<00:01:05.560> or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
have these big massive root balls or

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860 
have these big massive root balls or
they're<00:01:05.950> grown<00:01:06.190> in<00:01:06.220> containers<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.390> they're

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
they're grown in containers and they're

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.260 
they're grown in containers and they're
never<00:01:07.990> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.260> fit<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.680> bonsai<00:01:09.100> pot<00:01:09.400> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
never going to fit in a bonsai pot and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.170 
never going to fit in a bonsai pot and
also<00:01:10.420> we<00:01:10.690> have<00:01:10.780> these<00:01:10.960> big<00:01:11.760> require<00:01:12.760> calls

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
also we have these big require calls

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.470 
also we have these big require calls
carrot<00:01:13.630> roots<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.340> we've<00:01:15.490> got<00:01:15.640> these<00:01:15.850> very

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
carrot roots and so we've got these very

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.200 
carrot roots and so we've got these very
large<00:01:16.900> roots<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.250> we<00:01:18.910> don't<00:01:19.060> need

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
large roots in here and we don't need

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.390 
large roots in here and we don't need
large<00:01:19.510> roots<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.170> bonsai<00:01:20.590> containers<00:01:20.800> we<00:01:21.250> need

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
large roots in bonsai containers we need

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.970 
large roots in bonsai containers we need
to<00:01:21.520> find<00:01:21.730> fibrous<00:01:22.330> roots<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.470> get<00:01:23.710> fine

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
to find fibrous roots so to get fine

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.850 
to find fibrous roots so to get fine
fibrous<00:01:24.460> roots<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:24.940> have<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.210> cut<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.750> re<00:01:26.020> grow

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
fibrous roots we have to cut and re grow

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.670 
fibrous roots we have to cut and re grow
the<00:01:27.040> root<00:01:27.220> system<00:01:27.720> other<00:01:28.720> things<00:01:28.960> we<00:01:29.140> do<00:01:29.440> is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
the root system other things we do is

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.160 
the root system other things we do is
these<00:01:30.220> long<00:01:30.520> root<00:01:30.850> cuttings<00:01:31.240> here<00:01:31.570> these<00:01:31.930> all

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
these long root cuttings here these all

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.670 
these long root cuttings here these all
can<00:01:32.350> actually<00:01:32.830> be<00:01:33.360> cut<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.600> planted<00:01:35.470> and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
can actually be cut and planted and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.580 
can actually be cut and planted and
it'll<00:01:36.520> grow<00:01:36.670> another<00:01:37.030> tree<00:01:37.360> out<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.570> them<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.560> I

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
it'll grow another tree out of them so I

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.740 
it'll grow another tree out of them so I
just<00:01:38.890> keep<00:01:39.430> some<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.850> them<00:01:40.030> aside<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.690> then

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
just keep some of them aside and then

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.120 
just keep some of them aside and then
I'll<00:01:40.990> do<00:01:41.170> some<00:01:41.410> work<00:01:41.590> with<00:01:41.619> it

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
I'll do some work with it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.160 
I'll do some work with it
I'll<00:01:42.430> take<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.640> look<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.000> see<00:01:43.150> which<00:01:43.300> ones<00:01:43.570> look

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
I'll take a look and see which ones look

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.150 
I'll take a look and see which ones look
like<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.500> might<00:01:44.650> make<00:01:44.890> something

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
like they might make something

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.540 
like they might make something
interesting<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.990> something<00:01:47.320> fun<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.710> do<00:01:47.860> so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
interesting just something fun to do so

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.340 
interesting just something fun to do so
the<00:01:49.240> first<00:01:49.479> thing<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.690> do<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.140> I'm<00:01:50.320> just

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the first thing I do is just I'm just

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.410 
the first thing I do is just I'm just
gonna<00:01:50.619> kind<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.040> research<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.759> root<00:01:51.970> system<00:01:52.360> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
gonna kind of research the root system a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.020 
gonna kind of research the root system a
little<00:01:52.540> bit<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.900> find<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:54.460> we<00:01:54.580> have<00:01:54.790> in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
little bit and find out what we have in

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.650 
little bit and find out what we have in
here<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.850> lot<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.030> people<00:01:58.300> think<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
here and a lot of people think this is

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.080 
here and a lot of people think this is
really<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.590> know<00:01:59.619> brutal<00:02:00.250> or<00:02:00.490> hurts<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
really you know brutal or hurts the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.779 
really you know brutal or hurts the
plant<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:02.410> actually<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:02.950> really<00:02:03.340> good<00:02:03.580> because

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
plant it actually is really good because

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.850 
plant it actually is really good because
it<00:02:04.090> regenerates<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.869> root<00:02:05.140> system<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.679> gives

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
it regenerates the root system and gives

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.620 
it regenerates the root system and gives
us<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.130> nice<00:02:06.250> juvenile<00:02:06.940> root<00:02:07.210> system<00:02:07.600> which

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
us a nice juvenile root system which

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.469 
us a nice juvenile root system which
helps<00:02:07.990> make<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.289> plant<00:02:08.500> stronger<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.970> right

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
helps make the plant stronger so right

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.580 
helps make the plant stronger so right
in<00:02:10.630> here<00:02:11.050> I'm<00:02:11.470> gonna<00:02:11.650> take<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.100> off<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:14.080> just

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
in here I'm gonna take it off I'm just

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.170 
in here I'm gonna take it off I'm just
kind<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.920> feeling<00:02:15.130> around<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.819> there<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
kind of feeling around in there and I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.570 
kind of feeling around in there and I
feel<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.720> up<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.470> there<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:18.160> where<00:02:18.430> I'm

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
feel that up in there is about where I'm

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070 
feel that up in there is about where I'm
gonna<00:02:18.760> cut<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.360> I'm<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.630> gonna<00:02:19.780> take<00:02:20.050> my

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
gonna cut it so I'm just gonna take my

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.740 
gonna cut it so I'm just gonna take my
sawzall<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.250> I'm<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.270> gonna<00:02:22.450> lay<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.720> right

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
sawzall and I'm just gonna lay it right

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:47.130 
sawzall and I'm just gonna lay it right
on<00:02:22.990> there<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:24.490> just<00:02:24.520> gonna

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.330 

so<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.830> we've<00:02:48.040> got<00:02:49.350> all<00:02:50.350> these<00:02:50.650> new<00:02:50.710> root

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
so then we've got all these new root

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.380 
so then we've got all these new root
ends<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.910> I've<00:02:52.060> just<00:02:52.270> cut<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:55.000> happens

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
ends that I've just cut and what happens

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.670 
ends that I've just cut and what happens
as<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:55.960> where<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:56.440> white

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
as you can see where the little white

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
as you can see where the little white
sap<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.310> coming<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.790> around<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.210> bottom<00:02:58.600> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
sap is coming out around the bottom and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.650 
sap is coming out around the bottom and
that's<00:02:58.840> latex<00:02:59.770> that's<00:03:00.070> latex<00:03:00.940> comes<00:03:01.210> from<00:03:01.450> fig

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
that's latex that's latex comes from fig

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.010 
that's latex that's latex comes from fig
trees<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.740> what<00:03:03.370> we'll<00:03:03.520> do<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.000> we'll<00:03:04.780> just

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
trees so but what we'll do is we'll just

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.550 
trees so but what we'll do is we'll just
take<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.470> clean<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.490> all<00:03:06.640> out<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.050> I'll<00:03:08.050> kind

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
take this clean it all out and I'll kind

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.470 
take this clean it all out and I'll kind
of<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.770> through<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.190> remove<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.970> few<00:03:10.180> more<00:03:10.360> of

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
of go through and remove a few more of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.150 
of go through and remove a few more of
these<00:03:10.600> roots<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.380> simplify<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.130> little

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
these roots just to simplify it a little

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.090 
these roots just to simplify it a little
bit<00:03:12.400> more<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.959> we'll<00:03:14.110> pot<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.650> into<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
bit more and then we'll pot it up into a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.570 
bit more and then we'll pot it up into a
bulb<00:03:15.490> pan<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:16.630> shallow<00:03:17.410> training<00:03:18.070> pot<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
bulb pan a shallow training pot and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.390 
bulb pan a shallow training pot and
regrow<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.690> whole<00:03:19.900> new<00:03:20.050> root<00:03:20.230> system<00:03:20.650> while

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
regrow a whole new root system while

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370 
regrow a whole new root system while
we're<00:03:21.580> growing<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> new<00:03:22.090> foliage<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.900> then

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
we're growing the new foliage and then

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.990 
we're growing the new foliage and then
possibly<00:03:23.920> next<00:03:24.160> year<00:03:24.430> they'll<00:03:24.610> get<00:03:24.730> worked

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
possibly next year they'll get worked

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.120 
possibly next year they'll get worked
again<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.630> then<00:03:26.080> go<00:03:26.200> in<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> bonsai<00:03:26.739> container

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
again and then go in a bonsai container

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.120 
again and then go in a bonsai container
so<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:27.910> it
