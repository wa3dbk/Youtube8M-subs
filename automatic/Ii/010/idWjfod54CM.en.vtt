00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.569
 that to youtube welcome to girl and droid 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.249
 I am my this time I will show you 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.740
 three applications for those people 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:11.269
 they like to read like me and they do 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.700
 from any android device 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.799
 these applications are free and are in 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.640
 the play store so without further 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.640
 let's go with the video 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.770
 you know that all applications 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.380
 they will be down here in the description 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.840
 so they can download them without any 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.640
 problem the first application is google 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.010
 Playbooks is an excellent application 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.780
 that allows us to see buy 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.940
 books and acquire some of them from 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.370
 Free way the interface is pretty 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.640
 simple and fluency is very good we are going to 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.470
 be able to highlight texts quotes among others 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.879
 with different colors and the best of 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.920
 this application is that it comes with a 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.410
 included dictionary that will allow you 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.510
 make reading more enjoyable the only 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.800
 disadvantage of this application is that it 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.020
 read the books that are in your 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 device or that you have downloaded from 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.430
 way external to this application but 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 out of it it's worth it that the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.180
 try it does not require android in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.210
 specific since it varies according to the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.700
 device like its size well 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.440
 what do you expect and download because it's 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.990
 totally free and the truth is 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.390
 amazing 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.270
 we went through with the following application that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.369
 is uve reader is an application of 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.850
 free e-books that we 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.380
 allows you to read epub and pdf files the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.360
 application comes with an interface 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.159
 Elegant and easy to use and we 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 provides more comfortable experience 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.780
 reading for both smartphones and for 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.549
 Android tablets an explorer 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.679
 Integrated files allows you to read 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.970
 any ebook stored in the 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.979
 device and enable adobe open 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.799
 protected files by letting me in 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.869
 epub format and pdf we will also be able to 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.209
 buy books from this application and 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.789
 to have free access to books 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.640
 well known from this same as by 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.820
 example dracula or some other stories 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.650
 by edgar allan poe 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.890
 It should be clear that I am not saying that 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.110
 drÃ¡cula did the gar allan poe 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.360
 the only disadvantage is that it does not have 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.310
 integrated dictionary but rather we 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.630
 redirect to google to find the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.830
 word that we do not understand so good 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's say you lose a little time 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.500
 to the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 look for this word that we do not understand what 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.480
 that does not happen with the google playbooks anymore 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.060
 that's good and here's your dictionary 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.000
 integrated and then it's easier to require 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.980
 of Android 3.0 and higher versions and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.459
 It's totally free in the place now 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.470
 finally we have wat for is a reader 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.360
 of digital books that gives you access to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.120
 more than 100 thousand titles that can be 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.489
 downloaded and read for free to 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.230
 through your smartphone with android a 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.110
 great community of users is the one that 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 responsible for contributing to its growth 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.769
 adding material and you of course 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.530
 You can also add your ebooks

 favorites find books to read in 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 this application is a very task 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.880
 simple since you can search for them 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.470
 category title and its original language 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.780
 It has many options designed for 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.150
 help you in your reading you can choose the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.670
 background and color of the text change the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.680
 font and font size and move from 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.480
 very horizontal to vertical mode 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.280
 easily 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.380
 also when you are reading you can do 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.570
 that what pass automatically goes down 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.790
 the pages and pass them touching the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.640
 side of the screen as well as going to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.750
 certain percentage of the book 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.790
 unfortunately there are no page numbers 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.719
 so it is impossible to go up to a 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.180
 the book as well as we will have to 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.069
 require good we will have to have a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.060
 Internet connection to access 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.190
 library 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.739
 going through these small disadvantages 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.870
 It is an excellent application besides 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.489

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.560
