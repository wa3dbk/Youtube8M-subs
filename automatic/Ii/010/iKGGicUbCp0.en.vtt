to install their software on anything

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.560 
to install their software on anything
but<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.830> Mac<00:02:23.730> hardware<00:02:24.270> which<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.920> me

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
but a Mac hardware which is to me

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.950 
but a Mac hardware which is to me
ridiculous

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
ridiculous

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.710 
ridiculous
but<00:02:28.470> since<00:02:29.120> they<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.600> whatever<00:02:31.580> anyway

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
but since they do that whatever anyway

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
but since they do that whatever anyway
Windows<00:02:33.720> does<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.770> which<00:02:35.130> makes<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
Windows does not do that which makes it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.250 
Windows does not do that which makes it
perfect<00:02:36.030> client<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:37.040> doing<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:39.570> have<00:02:39.990> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
perfect client for doing this I have I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.820 
perfect client for doing this I have I
had<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:41.160> spare<00:02:41.790> copy<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.570> Windows<00:02:43.170> XP<00:02:43.320> laying

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
had a spare copy of Windows XP laying

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.940 
had a spare copy of Windows XP laying
around<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.910> haven't<00:02:45.330> used<00:02:45.690> since<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.770> got

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
around that I haven't used since I got

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.270 
around that I haven't used since I got
rid<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> my<00:02:47.460> old<00:02:47.700> laptop<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.050> that's<00:02:49.860> why<00:02:50.130> I'm

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
rid of my old laptop so that's why I'm

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.770 
rid of my old laptop so that's why I'm
using<00:02:50.520> Windows<00:02:50.850> XP

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
using Windows XP

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.530 
using Windows XP
I<00:02:51.810> even<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.800> Windows<00:02:53.160> 7<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> thought<00:02:54.480> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
I even have Windows 7 but I thought that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.770 
I even have Windows 7 but I thought that
might<00:02:54.960> run<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.440> bit<00:02:55.800> slower<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
might run a little bit slower so I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.320 
might run a little bit slower so I
already<00:02:58.320> installed<00:02:58.650> iTunes<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.700> install<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
already installed iTunes you install it
