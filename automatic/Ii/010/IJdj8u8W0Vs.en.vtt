00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.969
 e 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.760
 m 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.180
 not at all to my sufferings 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.180
 or new sewing tutorials 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.750
 after 11 rounds there is a special feast of 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.240
 mothers of the last time today 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.250
 I decided to go back to sewing with 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.690
 a penny of gross tutorial you have to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.790
 know now my great passion 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.710
 for the longshoremen so today that 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.180
 will once again be a tutorial that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.830
 will allow you to create one 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.680
 except this time I decided that 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.420
 this one is given it's going to be a little 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.190
 new compared to the previous 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.900
 I hope you like the idea all of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.940
 even I will use a brand new 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.199
 fabric that you have never seen and I 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.129
 will show you all the first 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.129
 accessories we will use 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.750
 the boss of sce tank top is located 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.520
 in the description of the video you 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 may have been able to see him on the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.899
 boss the bare back is going to be very indented 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.060
 that is to say, it will fall very low 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.799
 in your back so obviously if 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.509
 you do not like this style or if you do not 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.610
 do not want your back to be seen so much 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.190
 you can obviously change the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.649
 boss and shorten the naked back so that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.420
 this one remains very light so that after 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.610
 it depends on your taste and the result 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.649
 that you want to get once 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.539
 you will have seen the result of the tank top 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.009
 with his boss you can then 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.860
 see if you want to change it 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.970
 or keep it as is this tutorial does not 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.710
 should not take too much time 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.250
 since it's going to be pretty simple to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.260
 achieve 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.230
 so I'll start right away 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.570
 we start our tank top by the base 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.690
 of all the sewing tutorials that's at 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.330
 to say pinned our patterns on our fabric 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.310
 I will pinned successively the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.500
 front part then the back part of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.820
 my boss are cloth before then 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.820
 to cut everything around 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.050
 I painted then the front part is 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.300
 the back part of my t-shirt 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.190
 together at the shoulders and 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.190
 right and left sides of the tank 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.110
 at first I sew to 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.030
 places where I just positioned the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.770
 pins ie on both sides 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.770
 of the tank top and at the shoulders 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.620
 depending on the fabric you use 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.810
 you will probably have to make some 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.210
 lapel inside your t-shirt 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.850
 all other board including 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.950
 at the neck of the opening of the arms 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.120
 and the bottom of your tank top for my 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 part I do not need to realize 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.640
 this step because my fabric does not fray 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.710
 not and will not move if your son 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.660
 seems to be fraying especially do not hesitate 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.770
 not to sweat trick for that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.770
 do not arrive later 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.049
 the seam is already over I'm going 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.370
 to put on my tank top to show 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.370
 the result once worn 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.139
 I told you it is a culture 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.550
 that does not take a lot of time and I 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.499
 think you're starting to get used to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.210
 sewing t-shirts or longshoremen 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.039
 so I think some of us 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.810
 may be starting to get tired of 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.860
 shots of the same thing though at each 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.379
 time it's true that I have it is to add 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.090
 new things for example here he 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.740
 do not stick and there with a bare back 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.569
 and in some hours I had tried 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.759
 to vary like for example the time where 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.680
 I made this two-tone t-shirt 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.020
 you can find right here in 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.550
 clicking on the video as it is 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.229
 soon summer I will try to adapt 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.639
 more and more but follows auriel for 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.710
 this period whether it is in 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.939
 beautiful stitching or roofing one so 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.250
 for the next time I'm going to you 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.569

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.099
