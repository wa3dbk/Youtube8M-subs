micro-fine PTFE powder used to be called

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
micro-fine PTFE powder used to be called
Teflon<00:01:48.030> powder<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.659> DuPont<00:01:49.320> doesn't<00:01:50.070> allow

us<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.520> call<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.820> Teflon<00:01:51.180> powder<00:01:51.600> anymore<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
us to call it Teflon powder anymore so

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
us to call it Teflon powder anymore so
it's<00:01:52.610> PTFE<00:01:53.610> powder<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.369> good

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
know it's applied it's real easy once

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
know it's applied it's real easy once
you've<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> key<00:02:09.030> off<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.959> take<00:02:10.289> off

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you've got the key off you can take off

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.740 
you've got the key off you can take off
a<00:02:10.500> bunch<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.069> time<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> do

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
a bunch at a time to do

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.930 
a bunch at a time to do
do<00:02:12.410> several<00:02:12.710> ones<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.250> makes<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.700> process

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
do several ones that makes the process

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.430 
do several ones that makes the process
go<00:02:14.330> faster<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.270> best<00:02:17.660> way<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.870> apply<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.260> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
go faster the best way to apply it is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.030 
go faster the best way to apply it is
using<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.600> pipe<00:02:20.600> cleaner<00:02:20.840> okay<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.740> what<00:02:21.920> I've

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
using a pipe cleaner okay and what I've

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.590 
using a pipe cleaner okay and what I've
done<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.580> I've<00:02:22.730> taken<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.120> pipe<00:02:23.300> cleaner

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
done here is I've taken the pipe cleaner

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.300 
done here is I've taken the pipe cleaner
and<00:02:23.720> folded<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.440> half<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.920> I've<00:02:25.010> got<00:02:25.160> more

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
and folded it in half so I've got more

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.640 
and folded it in half so I've got more
surface<00:02:25.670> area<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:27.020> what<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.530> I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
surface area and then what I do is I

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.830 
surface area and then what I do is I
just<00:02:27.970> dip<00:02:28.970> though<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.970> pipe<00:02:32.180> cleaner<00:02:32.480> into

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
just dip though the pipe cleaner into

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.010 
just dip though the pipe cleaner into
the<00:02:33.130> powder<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.740> then<00:02:37.570> just<00:02:38.570> insert<00:02:38.990> that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the powder and then just insert that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.510 
the powder and then just insert that
into<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.980> hole<00:02:41.260> where<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.380> bushing<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.890> or

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
into the hole where the bushing is or

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.030 
into the hole where the bushing is or
the<00:02:43.700> key<00:02:43.910> pin<00:02:44.120> goes<00:02:44.560> okay<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.770> I'll<00:02:45.830> do<00:02:45.950> is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the key pin goes okay what I'll do is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.230 
the key pin goes okay what I'll do is
really<00:02:46.220> do<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.490> do<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.820> front<00:02:47.060> rail<00:02:49.240> bushing

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
really do is do the front rail bushing

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.490 
really do is do the front rail bushing
and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:50.570> I'll<00:02:50.690> do<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.959> balance<00:02:51.290> reel

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
and then I'll do the balance reel

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.640 
and then I'll do the balance reel
bushing<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:55.030> get<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.180> powder<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.660> there<00:02:56.870> okay

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
bushing I get that powder in there okay

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.290 
bushing I get that powder in there okay
and<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:57.860> once<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:58.760> there<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.030> want<00:02:59.209> to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
and then once it's in there you want to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.220 
and then once it's in there you want to
burnish<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> or<00:03:00.770> get<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> rubbed<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.760> there

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
burnish it to or get it rubbed in there

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.520 
burnish it to or get it rubbed in there
any<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.680> thin<00:03:04.670> tool<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.140> metal

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
any kind of thin tool this is a metal

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.720 
any kind of thin tool this is a metal
small<00:03:07.520> metal<00:03:07.850> rod<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.590> use<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.550> is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
small metal rod that I use this is

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.860 
small metal rod that I use this is
actually<00:03:11.150> our<00:03:11.270> grande<00:03:13.180> guide<00:03:14.180> rail<00:03:14.420> bushing

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
actually our grande guide rail bushing

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.100 
actually our grande guide rail bushing
either<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:17.590> works<00:03:18.590> well<00:03:18.709> as<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.780> bush<00:03:20.780> key

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
either but works well as a bush key

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.620 
either but works well as a bush key
bushing<00:03:21.500> burnisher<00:03:22.310> also<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.390> could<00:03:23.540> kind

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
bushing burnisher also so you could kind

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.050 
bushing burnisher also so you could kind
of<00:03:23.780> put<00:03:24.470> your<00:03:24.620> whatever<00:03:25.550> you're<00:03:25.730> gonna<00:03:25.820> use

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
of put your whatever you're gonna use

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.240 
of put your whatever you're gonna use
you<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.300> use<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> wood<00:03:26.780> dowel<00:03:27.250> something

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
you can use a wood dowel something

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.580 
you can use a wood dowel something
that's<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.700> know<00:03:29.140> slightly<00:03:30.140> smaller<00:03:30.470> than

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that's you know slightly smaller than

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.710 
that's you know slightly smaller than
the<00:03:30.769> diameter<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.269> key<00:03:32.450> pins

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the diameter of the of the key pins

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780 
the diameter of the of the key pins
works<00:03:33.019> well<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.400> what<00:03:34.519> you're<00:03:34.640> going<00:03:34.760> to

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
works well and then what you're going to

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.840 
works well and then what you're going to
do<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.000> you're<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.269> going<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.560> rub<00:03:36.560> that

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
do is you're just going to rub that

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.759 
do is you're just going to rub that
powder<00:03:37.850> into<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.470> end<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.739> felt<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:42.470> what

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
powder into the end of the felt and what

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.970 
powder into the end of the felt and what
that<00:03:42.920> does<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.340> will<00:03:44.799> get<00:03:45.799> that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
that does is that will get that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.039 
that does is that will get that
lubricant<00:03:46.519> in<00:03:46.700> there<00:03:46.940> Teflon<00:03:47.510> powder<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.989> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
lubricant in there Teflon powder is a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.220 
lubricant in there Teflon powder is a
very<00:03:48.350> slippery<00:03:48.739> substance<00:03:49.750> even<00:03:50.750> though<00:03:50.840> no

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
very slippery substance even though no

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.880 
very slippery substance even though no
though<00:03:51.470> it's<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.190> powder<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.590> works

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
though it's it's a powder so it works

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.949 
though it's it's a powder so it works
well<00:03:55.190> for<00:03:55.220> lubricating<00:03:56.000> those<00:03:56.239> key<00:03:56.450> bushings

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
well for lubricating those key bushings

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.979 
well for lubricating those key bushings
so<00:03:57.110> once<00:03:57.380> you've<00:03:58.330> once<00:03:59.330> you've<00:03:59.480> got<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.810> that

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
so once you've once you've got in that

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.810 
so once you've once you've got in that
that<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.470> there<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.799> again<00:04:01.190> we<00:04:01.459> usually<00:04:01.700> do

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
that in there and again we usually do

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.150 
that in there and again we usually do
several<00:04:02.150> at<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.420> time<00:04:02.690> but<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.650> would<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:03.950> put

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
several at a time but you would just put

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.910 
several at a time but you would just put
the<00:04:04.690> key<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:05.810> when<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.049> put<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.320> key<00:04:06.470> back<00:04:06.500> in

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
the key in when you put the key back in

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.340 
the key in when you put the key back in
as<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.489> might<00:04:07.760> notice<00:04:08.090> I'm<00:04:08.269> pushing<00:04:09.110> up<00:04:09.230> on

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
as you might notice I'm pushing up on
