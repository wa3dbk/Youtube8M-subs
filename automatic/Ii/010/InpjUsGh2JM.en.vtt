video number 6 of mine in this new
series<00:00:05.370> where<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:05.640> building<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.970> login

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
series where I'm building a login

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.820 
series where I'm building a login
registration<00:00:06.870> system<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:07.290> codeigniter

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830

what<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:08.610> doing<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> I'll<00:00:09.540> be

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
what I'm doing in this video is I'll be

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780 
what I'm doing in this video is I'll be
creating<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.139> new<00:00:10.260> model<00:00:10.440> with<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> function

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
creating a new model with a function

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
creating a new model with a function
called<00:00:11.969> can<00:00:12.210> log<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.570> which<00:00:12.719> will<00:00:12.900> essentially

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
called can log in which will essentially

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
called can log in which will essentially
evaluate<00:00:14.250> whether<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.820> user<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.750> log<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.170> with

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
evaluate whether a user can log in with

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.750 
evaluate whether a user can log in with
with<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> credentials<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.340> they<00:00:17.460> entered

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
with the credentials that they entered

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.269 
with the credentials that they entered
so<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.660> thing<00:00:18.810> I'll<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.140> create<00:00:19.279> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
so the first thing I'll do is create a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.320 
so the first thing I'll do is create a
new<00:00:20.670> model<00:00:21.410> we'll<00:00:22.410> call<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> model<00:00:23.760> underscore

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
new model we'll call it model underscore

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
new model we'll call it model underscore
users<00:00:25.609> just<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.820> we're<00:00:27.090> loading<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:31.279> open

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
users just like we're loading here open

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.880 
users just like we're loading here open
up<00:00:32.369> my<00:00:32.489> PHP<00:00:33.090> tag<00:00:33.300> I'll<00:00:34.079> leave<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> open<00:00:34.469> I'll

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
up my PHP tag I'll leave it open I'll

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
up my PHP tag I'll leave it open I'll
say<00:00:35.040> class<00:00:35.960> model<00:00:36.960> underscore<00:00:37.770> users<00:00:38.480> extends

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
say class model underscore users extends

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.430 
say class model underscore users extends
I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.649> mark<00:00:40.890> yeah<00:00:41.219> users<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:43.020> double

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I think it's mark yeah users just double

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.090 
I think it's mark yeah users just double
check<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.920> quick<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.750> mean<00:00:45.770> yet<00:00:46.770> model

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
check that really quick I mean yet model

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
check that really quick I mean yet model
underscore<00:00:47.460> users<00:00:47.820> good<00:00:49.219> extends<00:00:50.750> c<00:00:51.750> i

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
underscore users good extends c i

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
underscore users good extends c i
underscore<00:00:52.289> model<00:00:54.890> okay<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
underscore model okay now I'm going to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.660 
underscore model okay now I'm going to
create<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.510> public<00:00:57.870> function<00:01:02.870> call<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> can

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
create a public function call it can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.440 
create a public function call it can
underscore<00:01:05.670> log<00:01:05.939> underscore<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:08.270> okay<00:01:09.270> now

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
underscore log underscore in okay now

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
underscore log underscore in okay now
we're<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.869> passing<00:01:10.170> any<00:01:10.439> variables<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.159> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
we're not passing any variables to this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.500 
we're not passing any variables to this
I'm<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> rearrange<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm just going to rearrange this a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
I'm just going to rearrange this a
little<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:13.220> we're<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> pass<00:01:14.640> any

variables<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.960> going

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
variables to it because I'm just going

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
variables to it because I'm just going
to<00:01:16.170> grab<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.820> variables<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to grab the variables right from the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
to grab the variables right from the
post<00:01:18.869> data<00:01:19.080> using<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> CodeIgniter<00:01:20.430> way

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
post data using the CodeIgniter way

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.990 
post data using the CodeIgniter way
which<00:01:21.030> means<00:01:21.409> essentially<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.340> have

I'm<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> controller<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> model<00:01:28.950> or

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm in the controller or in the model or

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
I'm in the controller or in the model or
even<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> view<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.409> use

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
even in the view you can you can use

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.910 
even in the view you can you can use
that<00:01:31.799> post<00:01:33.530> function<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> showed<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that post function that I showed you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420 
that post function that I showed you
before<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> let's<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.220> first<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
before so let's do that first thing I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.030 
before so let's do that first thing I
want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> set<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.680> where

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
want to do is set to very to where

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
want to do is set to very to where
specifiers<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> username<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> password

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
specifiers for the username and password

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.480 
specifiers for the username and password
so<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.159> DB<00:01:44.990> where<00:01:48.799> where<00:01:49.799> female<00:01:51.079> is<00:01:52.490> equal

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so this DB where where female is equal

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
so this DB where where female is equal
to<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:56.790> input<00:01:58.520> post<00:02:01.490> email<00:02:03.439> okay<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> now

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to this input post email okay and now

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.779 
to this input post email okay and now
I'll<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.340> copy<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.850> where<00:02:06.060> password

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:25.150 

it's<00:02:10.789> equal<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.349> md5<00:02:17.500> whoa<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:20.510> okay<00:02:24.069> count<00:02:25.069> on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
it's equal to md5 whoa do okay count on

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's equal to md5 whoa do okay count on
it<00:02:25.280> three<00:02:25.580> there<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:33.819> perfect<00:02:34.819> Oh

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
it three there for perfect Oh

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.190 
it three there for perfect Oh
so<00:02:37.130> too<00:02:37.190> much<00:02:39.459> derp<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.760> only<00:02:41.660> need<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:41.900> there

okay cool
that<00:02:43.220> makes<00:02:43.370> sense<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.470> I'll<00:02:45.560> do

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that makes sense and then what I'll do

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.860 
that makes sense and then what I'll do
is<00:02:45.709> I'll<00:02:45.890> create<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.250> query<00:02:46.430> object<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.540> set<00:02:47.780> it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
is I'll create a query object and set it

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:58.840 
is I'll create a query object and set it
equal<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:54.069> DB<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.580> get

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
equal to this DB get so this is the get

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.840 
equal to this DB get so this is the get
will<00:02:59.120> actually<00:02:59.420> take<00:02:59.569> any<00:02:59.810> uh<00:03:00.850> anywhere

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
will actually take any uh anywhere

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.590

want to get it from so in that case it's

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.870 
want to get it from so in that case it's
just<00:03:12.230> users<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:14.450> i<00:03:14.510> want<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.750> go<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:15.670> now<00:03:16.670> this

to do all I have to do is actually

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.880 
to do all I have to do is actually
insert<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.150> user<00:03:59.390> before<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.200> can<00:04:00.410> actually<00:04:00.500> test

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
insert a user before I can actually test

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.520 
insert a user before I can actually test
this<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.790> going<00:04:02.060> back<00:04:02.420> into<00:04:02.660> my<00:04:02.840> MySQL

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
this so going back into my MySQL

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.870 
this so going back into my MySQL
database<00:04:03.859> click<00:04:04.160> on<00:04:04.280> insert<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:05.590> I'll<00:04:06.590> create

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
database click on insert and I'll create

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.819 
database click on insert and I'll create
someone<00:04:07.880> with<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.180> user<00:04:08.989> with<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.440> email<00:04:09.799> of

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
someone with the user with the email of

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.099 
someone with the user with the email of
hello<00:04:10.100> welcome<00:04:10.489> calm<00:04:11.000> then<00:04:11.750> what<00:04:11.900> I'm<00:04:11.989> going

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
hello welcome calm then what I'm going

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.009 
hello welcome calm then what I'm going
to<00:04:12.139> do<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.500> I'll<00:04:13.160> show<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.370> how<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.549> find<00:04:13.670> this

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
to do is I'll show you how to find this

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.560 
to do is I'll show you how to find this
create<00:04:15.019> an<00:04:15.260> md5<00:04:15.739> hash<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:17.120> word<00:04:17.269> password

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
create an md5 hash of the word password

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.779 
create an md5 hash of the word password
so<00:04:18.470> I'll<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.830> google<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.370> that's

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
so I'll just go to google and that's

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.200 
so I'll just go to google and that's
what<00:04:19.909> I<00:04:19.940> do<00:04:20.060> all<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.419> time

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.040 

I'll<00:04:24.480> go<00:04:25.190> md5<00:04:26.190> hash<00:04:27.890> generator<00:04:29.630> miracle<00:04:30.630> salad

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
I'll go md5 hash generator miracle salad

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.330 
I'll go md5 hash generator miracle salad
sweet<00:04:31.620> I'll<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.580> type<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:32.850> password<00:04:33.920> md5<00:04:34.920> and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
sweet I'll just type in password md5 and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.450 
sweet I'll just type in password md5 and
there's<00:04:35.520> my<00:04:35.670> md5<00:04:35.940> hash<00:04:36.300> copy<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.530> then

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
there's my md5 hash copy it and then

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.790 
there's my md5 hash copy it and then
just<00:04:38.700> paste<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.180> right<00:04:39.930> here

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.750 

perfect

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
perfect

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.700 
perfect
now<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.300> now<00:04:45.630> you'll<00:04:45.780> notice<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.140> right<00:04:46.500> here

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
now if now you'll notice like right here

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.640 
now if now you'll notice like right here
I<00:04:46.740> encrypt<00:04:47.550> whatever<00:04:47.940> they<00:04:48.090> typed<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.960> md5<00:04:49.380> and

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
I encrypt whatever they typed to md5 and

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.560 
I encrypt whatever they typed to md5 and
then<00:04:49.890> I<00:04:49.920> want<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> compare<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.880> thee<00:04:51.180> to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
then I want to compare that to thee to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.120 
then I want to compare that to thee to
the<00:04:51.690> entry<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.080> database<00:04:52.200> this<00:04:53.010> is

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
the entry in the database this is

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.470 
the entry in the database this is
important<00:04:53.490> because<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.700> actually<00:04:54.060> don't<00:04:54.390> want

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
important because I actually don't want

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.840 
important because I actually don't want
to<00:04:54.630> store<00:04:54.870> any<00:04:55.170> like<00:04:55.470> raw<00:04:56.070> passwords<00:04:56.640> on<00:04:56.760> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
to store any like raw passwords on the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.030 
to store any like raw passwords on the
database<00:04:57.210> that's<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.510> huge<00:04:57.750> security<00:04:58.020> risk<00:04:58.230> so

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
database that's a huge security risk so

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.530 
database that's a huge security risk so
what<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.160> do<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.550> encrypt<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.300> when<00:05:00.510> we

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
what I do is I encrypt it and when we

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.630 
what I do is I encrypt it and when we
register<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> user<00:05:01.470> we'll<00:05:01.860> also<00:05:02.070> encrypt<00:05:02.520> their

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
register a user we'll also encrypt their

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.420 
register a user we'll also encrypt their
data<00:05:02.790> their<00:05:03.120> password<00:05:04.190> right<00:05:05.190> now<00:05:05.310> we're

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
data their password right now we're

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.820 
data their password right now we're
doing<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.670> manually<00:05:06.030> with<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.300> generator<00:05:07.080> but

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
doing it manually with a generator but

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.470 
doing it manually with a generator but
our<00:05:08.220> code<00:05:08.460> will<00:05:08.640> actually<00:05:08.910> be<00:05:09.030> set<00:05:09.180> up<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.300> do

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
our code will actually be set up to do

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.460 
our code will actually be set up to do
this<00:05:09.510> eventually<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.020> if<00:05:10.170> you're<00:05:10.290> familiar

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
this eventually and if you're familiar

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.260 
this eventually and if you're familiar
with<00:05:10.680> other<00:05:10.920> ways<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.310> like<00:05:11.880> login

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
with other ways of like login

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.180 
with other ways of like login
registration<00:05:12.780> systems<00:05:13.170> this<00:05:13.680> will<00:05:13.860> be<00:05:13.950> really

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
registration systems this will be really

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.790 
registration systems this will be really
familiar<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.670> you

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
familiar to you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.370 
familiar to you
cool<00:05:16.850> now<00:05:17.850> actually<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.510> believe<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.200> should

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
cool now actually I believe it should

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.240 
cool now actually I believe it should
work<00:05:19.910> so<00:05:20.910> what<00:05:21.000> I'll<00:05:21.090> do<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.390> I'll<00:05:21.630> enter<00:05:21.870> some

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
work so what I'll do is I'll enter some

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.160 
work so what I'll do is I'll enter some
bogus<00:05:23.250> information<00:05:23.870> then<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:24.990> have<00:05:25.140> a

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
bogus information then we have a

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.590 
bogus information then we have a
incorrect<00:05:25.980> username<00:05:26.400> password<00:05:26.790> notice<00:05:27.450> I

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
incorrect username password notice I

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.410 
incorrect username password notice I
actually<00:05:27.780> don't<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.710> don't<00:05:29.040> have<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.730> callback

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
actually don't I don't have a callback

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.130 
actually don't I don't have a callback
to<00:05:31.020> check<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:32.130> email<00:05:32.400> exists<00:05:32.910> that's<00:05:33.870> a

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
to check if the email exists that's a

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.840 
to check if the email exists that's a
pretty<00:05:34.470> big<00:05:34.620> security<00:05:35.040> risk<00:05:35.310> because<00:05:35.400> that

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
pretty big security risk because that

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.670 
pretty big security risk because that
way<00:05:35.940> somebody<00:05:36.150> just<00:05:36.660> go<00:05:36.810> through<00:05:37.020> like<00:05:37.230> they

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
way somebody just go through like they

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.670 
way somebody just go through like they
can<00:05:37.860> brute-force<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.550> guess<00:05:39.470> I'm<00:05:40.470> not<00:05:40.620> sure

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
can brute-force it I guess I'm not sure

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.500 
can brute-force it I guess I'm not sure
that's<00:05:41.250> where<00:05:41.430> they<00:05:41.550> literally<00:05:41.850> try<00:05:42.150> every

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
that's where they literally try every

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.840 
that's where they literally try every
single<00:05:42.840> like<00:05:43.250> possibility<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.340> like<00:05:44.520> email

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
single like possibility of like email

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.630 
single like possibility of like email
addresses<00:05:45.360> or<00:05:45.480> whatever<00:05:46.100> but<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.160> way<00:05:47.400> like

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
addresses or whatever but that way like

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.190 
addresses or whatever but that way like
I'm<00:05:47.790> not<00:05:48.030> telling<00:05:48.390> them<00:05:48.540> if<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.780> name<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:49.050> like

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
I'm not telling them if the name a like

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.990 
I'm not telling them if the name a like
just<00:05:49.500> or<00:05:49.680> not<00:05:49.830> I'm<00:05:50.010> just<00:05:50.280> saying<00:05:50.430> if<00:05:50.610> they<00:05:50.760> can

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
just or not I'm just saying if they can

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.700 
just or not I'm just saying if they can
log<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.330> with<00:05:51.360> their<00:05:51.570> credentials<00:05:52.320> or<00:05:52.470> if<00:05:52.590> they

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
log in with their credentials or if they

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.190 
log in with their credentials or if they
can't<00:05:53.240> which<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.480> best<00:05:54.630> way<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.810> do<00:05:55.020> it<00:05:55.110> as

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
can't which is the best way to do it as

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.520 
can't which is the best way to do it as
far<00:05:55.350> as<00:05:55.470> I've<00:05:55.950> been<00:05:56.040> taught<00:05:57.200> so<00:05:58.200> what<00:05:58.320> I'll<00:05:58.410> do

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
far as I've been taught so what I'll do

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.350 
far as I've been taught so what I'll do
is<00:05:58.560> I'll<00:05:59.070> even<00:05:59.250> try<00:05:59.490> some<00:05:59.670> other<00:05:59.760> types<00:06:00.270> of

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
is I'll even try some other types of

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.910 
is I'll even try some other types of
validation<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:00.990> now<00:06:01.320> I'll<00:06:01.440> actually<00:06:01.560> try<00:06:01.830> and

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
validation and now I'll actually try and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.290 
validation and now I'll actually try and
log<00:06:02.460> in<00:06:02.670> with<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.030> good<00:06:03.210> credentials<00:06:05.300> comm

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
log in with the good credentials comm

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.590 
log in with the good credentials comm
and<00:06:06.510> then<00:06:06.930> password<00:06:07.470> is<00:06:07.590> password<00:06:08.600> incorrect

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
and then password is password incorrect

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.240 
and then password is password incorrect
