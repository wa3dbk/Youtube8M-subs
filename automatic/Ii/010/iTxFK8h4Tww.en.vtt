00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello good afternoon we are here in 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.229
 use it to record the atmosphere of the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.570
 Hi, we're with some of the 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.549
 of lapeña and we're not going to do the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.759
 good questions what do you think of the program 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.550
 of fairs, because it seems to me that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.949
 well on Saturday is san pedro when 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 presented the queens then then there are 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.269
 more there are concerts like the concert of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 loop but for example it seems wrong 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.189
 because this year there is no grand prix and we are going 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 to me for that I like a lot is one of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 the ones I like the most about what there is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.400
 young people and come on I think you have to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.990
 have more party for young people that is 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.030
 encourage everyone to come to arévalo 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.030
 that is the best parties there 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.990
 and good and for young people what do you think 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.060
 there are many things or there are few good 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.750
 well everything is good - the great 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.750
 missing prix 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.500
 and nothing else and the concerts that there are and 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.030
 that comes what is good 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.670
 your rock as it is called teaches that the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 cat water invites and you start all 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.119
 the world is this the world and half takes 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.479
 it is a gossip a cubata what the 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.630
 win 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.479
 it's worth nothing then a greeting 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 a month for my rock that tastes water and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 hello we are here in the insomnia rock and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.400
 let's ask some questions to these 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.560
 kids 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.720
 arévalo party and local as 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.300
 right now the holidays this year are going to 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.590
 be very simple because between they have 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.150
 removed the grand prix that has always 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
 liked all the clubs and participated 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.010
 in all the clubs and that there are very few 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.800
 things and very simple orchestras has always 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.200
 there were more things and a lot of party 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.140
 for young people or nothing there is very little 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 thing and about the locals what do you think are 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.840
 expensive are a little expensive 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.270
 a part but always that comes in 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.270
 fairs want to have your local your rock 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.150

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.160
 time with friends and your costumes 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.460
