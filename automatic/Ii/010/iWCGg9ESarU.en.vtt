00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.809
 hello everyone today we will fight 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.889
 an affliction which is characteristic of two 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.110
 image types for image 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.029
 overexposed them and for old they are in 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.730
 In general, it is characterized by the fact that 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.449
 time or because of incorrect 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.660
 shooting they have black and white pixels 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:30.460
 aim for a gray plan for a gray level 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.539
 brightness that is, we have a range of limits 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:44.140
 ardent luminance range of photoshop 1 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:47.750
 extends from 0 to 255 to gray white 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.570
 255 seek to gray too but they 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.929
 In general, this leads to the fact that the contrast 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.100
 of our image decreases but not 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:01.449
 worth confusing this image of them 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.190
 ills here with this kind of defects 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.790
 ordering candles 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 some particular plot this is another 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.850
 another type of wrong shooting here 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.850
 just shooting was made against 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.470
 bright light in some determine there 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.130
 the light hit a certain point 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.240
 in this case, here's the sky we have the roof and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.970
 a little bit here made buildings steel 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.050
 white actually the sky we do not have here 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 all blue here these tones and clouds all 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.060
 left just white pixels from this kind 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 problems struggling a little bit differently 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.520
 not like we will fight today with 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.620
 problems of this kind open 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.460
 picture and we see here 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.340
 the next here is all pixels 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.150
 lighten the shooting was done in the dark 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.520
 indoors 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.950
 bright flash and here's the whole image of us 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.290
 illuminated 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.660
 what we should have is dark black 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.490
 the sweater was supposed to be now 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.210
 such that we will do what plan we are 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.360
 should 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:22.070
 black dark pixels darken and then 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.640
 appreciating the image we have to 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:30.459
 lighten what is behind our dungeons 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.459
 the first step we will apply two 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.700
 blending mode is small and warm screen 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.440
 in the English layout in Russian it 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.570
 multiplication mode 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.180
 screen what do overlay bans do 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.590
 blend mode multiply it darkens 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.290
 absolutely all pixels 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 And the screen mode is lightened and the order is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.000
 they are in general then by and large 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.570
 opposite opposite kind 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.459
 overlay actions 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.019
 see what we will do we have 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.150
 our image will click on the button 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:15.400
 crossed circle and here we have 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 regime level corrective and we need 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.230
 dots level adjustment layer 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.019
 black and white in this correction we 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.310
 I did not resort that is nothing 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.769
 we are not affected 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 so first of all we will Assad darken 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.950
 all pixels 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.799
 we are from the normal overlay mode or 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.820
 common in the Russian layout we go 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.880
 overlay mode here we have everything 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.650
 pixel then nellis but 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.780
 as we understand at a glance so in our 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 normal, nothing is never 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.960
 looks like they are not such dark faces 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.210
 there are no such dark hands of the door of the wall 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.390
 we want it to look like 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.240
 more natural therefore we 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.160
 opacity reduce in general all 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.140
 it's always experimentally you 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.640
 imagine something like this all 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.730
 filmed as it should have looked 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.830
 and here it seems to me here when it was shot 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.700
 this photo should be like this 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.980
 take the opacity 70 percent but 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.010
 as I said overlay mode 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.280
 multiplication it darkens all pixels 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.470
 that is, we have by and large then not 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.000
 climb what was supposed to darken the sweater 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.050
 doors the walls of the floor but then not the fox faces and 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.160
 leather 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.590
 so we will use another layer 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.250
 level 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 so here we have too. black and white 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.590
 don't touch don't put it in mode 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.870
 the screen now we are all of course very 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.580
 lighten up much as you understand it 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.970
 that lighten up in tap mode all 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.530
 the pixels are absolutely but it is fixable 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.850
 use opacity and how we 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.210
 we understand we had to lighten up 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.700
 a little bit perfect that's why we'll leave 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.850
 opacity somewhere 20 right now 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.060
 it looks good here a little bit as 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.850
 with lily what was and here I am personally 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.710
 I like very much to check ours 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.070
 the correction has worked together 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.930
 corrective level control naph 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.400
 we take these two layers and combine them 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.170
 control key group jay 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.050
 we have created such a folder 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.430
 how it turns off and on 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.400
 visibility of the layers we have here 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.070
 eye here now we see ours 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.250
 correction imposed 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:56.070
 let's turn off and see from what we 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.700
 went and what came here was here 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.500
 so how do we actually see when i 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.630
 only opened it for some reason to me on pervachka 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.960
 so it seemed that the image is not 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.810
 it is very illuminated with us not very perry 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.210
 exposed but if that's when there is 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.940
 something to compare, we can see that's quite 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.890
 clearly that the picture was originally but 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.370
 very white 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:25.530
 even how awful white you see with us 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:29.340
 all the walls just whitish that's what we 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.930
 came by and large with this 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.630
 kind of 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.040
 disease with perek planned with Susan 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.350
 aging image 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.950
 you know old pictures when they don't fade 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.490
 everything about it is certainly not the same 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.680
 white becomes on becomes 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.300
 incredibly not contrasting fights like 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.300
 such corrective layers 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.000
 multiplication and screen multiply dim 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.390
 dark and 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.960
 a white slightly return brightness 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:08.730
 pixels that we need need it 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.640
 light wives by and large overcame 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:17.540
 we have this ailment photograph in 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.370
 largely saved this type 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.669
 the problem of course is never absolutely 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:27.560
 cannot be removed entirely but can be brought 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:31.050
 quite decent view i would say that for 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.270
 pictures that were made just in 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.980
 practical dimly lit room 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:41.630
 at night without lighting naturally with bright 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.630
 flash nose result is very good 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:47.050
 well if you have the same kind 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.819
 problems in photos sometimes happen 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.440
 that at some point you don't even 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:52.599
 imagine that all the pictures so 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.569
 can spoil and here if you have them 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:08:00.190
 there are such or how you come across it 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:03.340
 to fight it should be like that but the other 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:08.099
 sort of problem we will solve the following 

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.099
 lessons and on this for now
