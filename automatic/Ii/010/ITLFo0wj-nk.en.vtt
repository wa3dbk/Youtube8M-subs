00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.450 

and<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.870> just<00:03:16.990> gets<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.380> little<00:03:17.560> wet<00:03:17.980> glossed

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
and it just gets a little wet glossed

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.020

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
need to apply any on pause because it's

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.690 
need to apply any on pause because it's
not<00:03:23.710> really<00:03:23.890> gonna<00:03:24.010> make<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.190> difference<00:03:24.490> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
not really gonna make a difference just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.810 
not really gonna make a difference just
in<00:03:25.180> for<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.420> top<00:03:25.570> lashes<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.670> was<00:03:27.790> a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
in for the top lashes so that was a

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.360 
in for the top lashes so that was a
really<00:03:28.060> creepy<00:03:28.330> things<00:03:28.750> okay<00:03:29.170> live<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.040> up<00:03:30.070> not

it's<00:03:35.230> definitely<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.040> optional<00:03:36.550> when<00:03:37.210> I<00:03:37.300> was

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's definitely so optional when I was

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.150 
it's definitely so optional when I was
in<00:03:37.510> fifth<00:03:37.720> grade<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:38.170> didn't<00:03:38.440> wear<00:03:38.590> like<00:03:38.830> any

makeup<00:03:40.050> but<00:03:41.050> when<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.290> did<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:42.100> think<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.880> were

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
makeup but when I did I think I were

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.230 
makeup but when I did I think I were
black<00:03:44.380> mascara<00:03:44.860> which<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.280> don't<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.970> don't

black mascara which I don't I don't

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.000 
black mascara which I don't I don't
recommend<00:03:46.720> wearing<00:03:47.050> that<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.590> just<00:03:47.830> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
recommend wearing that it's just I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.980 
recommend wearing that it's just I
thought<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.310> was<00:03:48.490> so<00:03:48.670> cool<00:03:48.880> if<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.120> wore<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.360> so<00:03:49.750> I

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
thought I was so cool if I wore it so I

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.470 
thought I was so cool if I wore it so I
don't<00:03:50.470> recommend<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:51.010> though<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.210> step

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
don't recommend it though but this step
