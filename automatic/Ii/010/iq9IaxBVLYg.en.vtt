over and slide it back into the tube now
the<00:00:54.629> wire<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> naturally<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
the wire is going to naturally want to

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.680 
the wire is going to naturally want to
cross<00:00:56.190> inside<00:00:56.580> of<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.790> tube<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.269> you're<00:00:57.479> going

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
cross inside of the tube so you're going

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.710 
cross inside of the tube so you're going
to<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.900> to<00:00:58.260> separate<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.309> hand

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
to have to separate it with your hand

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.479 
to have to separate it with your hand
hold<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:00.900> between<00:01:00.960> your<00:01:01.170> thumb<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.530> keep<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
hold it between your thumb and keep it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
hold it between your thumb and keep it
uncrossed<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> make<00:01:04.320> sure<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
uncrossed and you want to make sure that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
uncrossed and you want to make sure that
that<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.430> loop<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.270> eighth<00:01:06.420> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that little loop is about one eighth of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
that little loop is about one eighth of
an<00:01:06.690> inch<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.409> too<00:01:07.560> close<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
an inch because if it's too close to the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
an inch because if it's too close to the
wire<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.240> wear<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> jewelry<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.200> wire

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
wire as you wear the jewelry the wire

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
wire as you wear the jewelry the wire
will<00:01:10.620> begin<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> abrade<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.970> will

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
will begin to abrade and then you will

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.140 
will begin to abrade and then you will
end<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> broken<00:01:12.690> Nicholas<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
end up with a broken Nicholas this is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.520 
end up with a broken Nicholas this is
the<00:01:15.240> crimp<00:01:15.479> tool<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.500> has

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the crimp tool and as you can see it has

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.550 
the crimp tool and as you can see it has
two<00:01:16.979> different<00:01:17.370> poles<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.900> front<00:01:19.140> hole<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
two different poles the front hole is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
two different poles the front hole is
smooth<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.010> round<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.150> hole<00:01:21.390> looks

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
smooth and round and the back hole looks

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
smooth and round and the back hole looks
a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:21.960> bit<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> heart<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> first

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
a little bit like a heart for the first

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
a little bit like a heart for the first
step<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.510> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> front<00:01:25.170> hole

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
step you're going to use the front hole

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.660 
step you're going to use the front hole
and<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> compress<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.150> tube

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
and you're going to compress this tube

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.790 
and you're going to compress this tube
into<00:01:29.670> an<00:01:30.360> oval<00:01:30.720> shape<00:01:32.090> like<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> next

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
into an oval shape like so the next

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
into an oval shape like so the next
thing<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> want<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.370> do<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:38.160> use<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.550> back

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
thing you want to do is to use the back

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
thing you want to do is to use the back
hole<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.080> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
hole and you're going to actually be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.470 
hole and you're going to actually be
creating<00:01:44.030> an<00:01:45.030> indented<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.810> crimped<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:47.480> now

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
creating an indented or crimped to now

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.930

you're going to take the crimp tool and
you're<00:01:50.940> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> put<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.260> that<00:01:52.350> front

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
you're going to put it in that front

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.950 
you're going to put it in that front
hole<00:01:52.830> again<00:01:53.160> you're<00:01:54.030> basically<00:01:54.210> bending

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
hole again you're basically bending

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.290

those two ends over one another now
you've<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.720> created<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.940> crimped<00:02:02.940> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you've had created a crimped and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.230 
you've had created a crimped and
attached<00:02:04.200> water<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.700> next<00:02:06.000> thing<00:02:06.120> you're

can<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> top<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.930> tube<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
can to the top of that tube so that you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.780 
can to the top of that tube so that you
don't<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> wire<00:02:17.480> poking<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:19.460> is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
don't have a wire poking out and that is

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.289 
don't have a wire poking out and that is
how<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.180> attach<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.200> clasp<00:02:21.800> lick<00:02:22.520> or<00:02:22.730> two

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.309 

now<00:02:30.299> don't<00:02:30.450> expect<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.959> an<00:02:31.049> expert

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
now don't expect to be an expert

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.449 
now don't expect to be an expert
overnight<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> little<00:02:32.159> practice

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
overnight but with a little practice

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.220 
overnight but with a little practice
soon<00:02:32.939> enough<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.299> be<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> pro<00:02:33.719> and<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:34.109> you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
soon enough to be a pro and then you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.899 
soon enough to be a pro and then you
really<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.920> able<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.219> create<00:02:35.459> without
