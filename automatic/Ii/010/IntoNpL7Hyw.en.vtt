them<00:00:13.110> another<00:00:14.929> and<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.470> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
them another and I'm going to kind of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
them another and I'm going to kind of
skip<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> deck<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> little<00:00:17.609> bit<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.910> front

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
skip the deck out a little bit up front

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.900 
skip the deck out a little bit up front
give<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.230> deck<00:00:19.560> rocker

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
give it a little bit more deck rocker

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.070 
give it a little bit more deck rocker
kind<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.180> lighten<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:21.990> bit

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
kind of just lighten it up a little bit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
kind of just lighten it up a little bit
and<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.100> how<00:00:23.310> does<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and then how does you can see the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.560 
and then how does you can see the
footwells<00:00:24.800> got<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> recess<00:00:26.369> little<00:00:27.150> rise<00:00:27.330> in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
footwells got a recess little rise in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
footwells got a recess little rise in
the<00:00:27.660> middle<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.070> wrap<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.310> with

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the middle and when we wrap it with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.630 
the middle and when we wrap it with
carbon<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.570> contours<00:00:31.640> curve

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
carbon all these little contours curve

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
carbon all these little contours curve
the<00:00:32.850> carbon<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.260> helps<00:00:34.500> stiffen<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the carbon and it helps stiffen the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.430 
the carbon and it helps stiffen the
Warren<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.210> carbon<00:00:36.450> wraps<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:37.200> these

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Warren up so the carbon wraps over these

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
Warren up so the carbon wraps over these
curves<00:00:37.770> around<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.610> realms<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
curves around the realms and then it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
curves around the realms and then it
double<00:00:39.780> wraps<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> bottom<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.770> over

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
double wraps from the bottom up over

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
double wraps from the bottom up over
this<00:00:41.160> relic<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:42.149> tibia<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.809> like

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this relic at right tibia is like

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
this relic at right tibia is like
multiple<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.129> eye<00:00:44.309> beam<00:00:44.610> style

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

close to where your stroke your feed go

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609 
close to where your stroke your feed go
you<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.119> once<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> board<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you know so once you get the board to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.819 
you know so once you get the board to
planing<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:33.180> releases<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> edge<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.650> get

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
planing it releases on the edge you get

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
planing it releases on the edge you get
more<00:01:35.040> glide<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
more glide you know so that's kind of a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.539 
more glide you know so that's kind of a
little<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.770> pick<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.430> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
little bit of what you pick up when your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.060 
little bit of what you pick up when your
runs<00:01:38.729> off<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> why<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> edge<00:01:40.890> will

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
runs off and why just put the edge will

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.749 
runs off and why just put the edge will
do<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.990> sweets<00:01:43.649> table<00:01:43.950> yeah

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
do for you you know sweets table yeah

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.080 
do for you you know sweets table yeah
was<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.240> image<00:01:45.540> rate<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> one's<00:01:46.350> 28<00:01:47.009> 14<00:01:48.000> x

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
was an image rate so this one's 28 14 x

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.160 
was an image rate so this one's 28 14 x
28<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.899> super<00:01:49.229> stable<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
28 so it's super stable and then you can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
28 so it's super stable and then you can
see<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> rules<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.829> trapped<00:01:53.100> under<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
see the rules are trapped under for a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340 
see the rules are trapped under for a

carbon on the bottom wrapped up and
around<00:05:59.039> this<00:05:59.250> rail<00:05:59.930> okay<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.380> that's<00:06:01.530> one

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
around this rail okay so that's one

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.129

will<00:06:04.320> be<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.470> deck<00:06:04.740> patch<00:06:05.010> put<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.550> pretty<00:06:05.849> much

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
will be a deck patch put in pretty much

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.220 
will be a deck patch put in pretty much
right<00:06:06.210> where<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.449> stand

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
right where you stand

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.550 
right where you stand
other<00:06:07.350> piece<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.590> carbon<00:06:08.160> now<00:06:08.700> wrap<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.300> rail

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
other piece of carbon now wrap the rail

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.930 
other piece of carbon now wrap the rail
so<00:06:10.560> these<00:06:10.710> rails<00:06:11.040> right<00:06:11.340> through<00:06:11.580> here<00:06:11.760> are

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
so these rails right through here are

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.280 
so these rails right through here are
going<00:06:12.090> to<00:06:12.150> have<00:06:12.270> two<00:06:12.480> layers<00:06:12.690> they're<00:06:13.110> going

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
going to have two layers they're going

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.740 
going to have two layers they're going
to<00:06:13.380> full<00:06:13.680> sheet<00:06:13.950> of<00:06:14.070> carbon<00:06:14.280> on<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.490> top<00:06:14.790> it

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
to full sheet of carbon on the top it

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.420 
to full sheet of carbon on the top it
wraps<00:06:16.020> all<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.350> way<00:06:16.470> around<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.890> the<00:06:17.040> ads<00:06:17.190> on

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
wraps all the way around to the ads on

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.760 
wraps all the way around to the ads on
the<00:06:17.490> lawn<00:06:17.670> right<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:18.750> you<00:06:18.900> end<00:06:19.110> up<00:06:19.200> with<00:06:19.320> triple

carbon 6 ounce on these rails or this

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.000 
carbon 6 ounce on these rails or this
side<00:06:23.330> will<00:06:24.330> give<00:06:24.540> you<00:06:24.690> your<00:06:24.870> virginity<00:06:25.410> down
