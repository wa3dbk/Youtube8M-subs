 your enrico 91 the speaker is today i am 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.679
 in your company for a new video 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.670
 new video about a new depp 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 profile 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.160
 after a while I apologize for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.119
 for the absence and we leave immediately with 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.980
 the dec profile 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 this time we are talking about lightroom ruler 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 mazzocchi and that is how it started to be 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.840
 played after the European in which he arrived 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.880
 second and I bring the network profile 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 let's start with the three rulers 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.719
 redhawks blaster and storm the game only 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.020
 these three because these two beat and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.760
 this defender and this one 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 I prefer acts from simply because 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.039
 then we remove from the rose that deviates into 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 network revoke it so these were i 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.590
 trailer then the three eclipse wyvern 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:06.030
 obviously they are used to remove and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.780
 to have the two diables in hand in the three that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.270
 what does ninety per shift remove a he 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.049
 is summoned if I control the 5 light with 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.860
 different names from c zero is once per 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.390
 round I remove a rebel light a 7 a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 card placed the opponents 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.619
 definitely tension at the bottom of the deck e 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.100
 the 3jay monster boss of judgment dragon 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.380
 dragon of judgment dragon ducismo and va 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.020
 well you all know what it does so I'm not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.799
 to explain it I look for 2 ultimate for 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 whoever had them contact me then department 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.700
 nice one 3 luni nor obviously paper 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.290
 very strong and I also look for these super 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.649
 that thanks to you then contact me two 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.659
 lille and why three are so many times 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.790
 according to me then to break back 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.640
 another high starting ball of the deck 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.950
 that rai of the new support released by 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.910
 from the really strong millstone structures 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.989
 two during the round and increase by 200 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.239
 the final attack the face 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.569
 of the opponent for each live tour 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.420
 ground and grind 2 end then evo 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.760
 I will know 4 so it works then monococco 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.250
 to harold to do the race was for 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.400
 remove problems such as hands all in the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.040
 jane but I don't like a name in 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 the same goes for a web will come 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.590
 replaced by felix when it comes out e 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.380
 minerva the paper looks like this new one 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 what it does when it is sent from the hand 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.650
 or from the dec to the cemetery but we are one in 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.870
 plus it is a level 3 tunnel and then later 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.650
 when it is voted I add a dragon 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.690
 lower level equal to the number of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.220
 slap-up condominiums towards the cemetery and with 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.640
 all these light a little with dear rest 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.980
 then the inquiries department b2 whose bandit is the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.720
 rainbow oar because it is better than nigger 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.519
 I think it's better than a nigger 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.880
 first of all because it attacks an attack two 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:16.109
 sometimes in the cross and in the evening you draw in the hand 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.540
 difficult to send him to the cemetery you have to 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.639
 see or lumina or something to discard 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.470
 with him there is no problem in the peep at a 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.049
 monster or opponent can not attack 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.980
 so stop is also useful because 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.450
 light for hell then much and charge 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.669
 obviously and 3 refills for brom power 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.790
 these replies to the game alone 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.790
 social and two launches for defense then 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.560
 we have the few traps 2 breakthru 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.079
 skilled because even if they are ground 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.889
 good and the other departure in the mazzoni of 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:54.060
 vallÃ¨s what does it simply do a 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.139
 dine 5 and active a basin 5 you can 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.359
 understand that it is strong 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:02.880
 let's move on to the extra obviously not 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.349
 can miss a dragon since they are the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.200
 suitable dragons from rose then between the eight 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.530
 fair big because when i do on i 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.580
 drawings and I do not close to make do 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.270
 big and strong 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.490
 large 7 dragon sacs and nurseries 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.250
 it only takes one does not need more words 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.330
 there is no room for anything else 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.700
 then ranks four ex eaton 101 the valva 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.180
 ace in fortissimo demand the 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.440
 fourth light journal cemetery bottin 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.300
 cbtc but what you really want 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.510
 very strong mandanda work demands 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.440
 viverna fortissimo ranks 3 the evian for 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:49.450
 pull the removed rome and the engineer for 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:52.780
 defend yourself from synchro star iter leo decisive 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.000
 armor forte with wright sword is in 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.430
 practice takes on an effect I don't remember 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.780
 what makes it so I read one 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.670
 time per turn if you opponent against 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.950
 the most light monsters discovered patrick 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.190
 omondi these effects or fabrizio evening 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.690
 born of your opponent and destroy the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.060
 asks for a card from his hand from 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.070
 your hand to the cemetery to make duster 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.560
 the harpies then break all the tips 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.710
 between for the opponent or discard all 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.240
 shoes all the cards to watch the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.950
 hand go to the cemetery why look 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.720
 the opponent's hand looks and sends 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.700
 at the cemetery the monsters come out a hand e 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.620
 then do damage equal to the sum of 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.780
 attacks and monsters sent the cemetery 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.160
 so it's strong against light ward against 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.000
 lies can be strong 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.070
 not bad then levels 8 stardust scraps 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.690
 level 7 black rose michael mai 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.650
 something ago is a 262 thousand once per 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.080
 I pay one thousand I remove one 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.250
 to one of us on the ground not a card on the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.949
 soil and faithful light therefore counts 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.440
 for different faithful for Thursday 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.610
 so really strong and last 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.650
 goio card and I do not remember are 15 le 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.419
 16 of extras I tell you sincerely me

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:17.600
 and stardust ran and nothing this 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.900

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.210
