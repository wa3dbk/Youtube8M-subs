of<00:00:36.660> basic<00:00:37.350> button<00:00:37.680> presses<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.550> you'll

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
of basic button presses that you'll

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
of basic button presses that you'll
definitely<00:00:38.910> definitely<00:00:39.600> want<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.870> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a mouse that has a wheel on it that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.620 
a mouse that has a wheel on it that
makes<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:44.970> easier<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.270> certain<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
makes it a lot easier for certain you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.940 
makes it a lot easier for certain you
saw<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.810> instead<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> clicking<00:01:46.380> each

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
saw but instead of clicking each

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
saw but instead of clicking each
individual<00:01:47.460> joint<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> find<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> motion<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
individual joint to find the motion you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.880 
individual joint to find the motion you
want<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.350> move<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.560> mouse<00:01:49.619> wheel

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
want you can just move your mouse wheel

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730 
want you can just move your mouse wheel
up<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.090> alternate<00:01:51.630> between<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
up and down to alternate between up and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.120 
up and down to alternate between up and
down<00:01:52.860> movements<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.360> use<00:01:54.680> X<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
down movements and then you can use X to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.459 
down movements and then you can use X to
lock<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.640> X<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.299> unlock<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
lock an X to unlock that way it's so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.630 
lock an X to unlock that way it's so
much<00:01:58.619> quicker<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.860> clicking<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> mean<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
much quicker than clicking it I mean you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.649 
much quicker than clicking it I mean you
can<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> an<00:02:00.090> entire<00:02:00.329> photo<00:02:00.570> without

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
can get to an entire photo without

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.899 
can get to an entire photo without
clicking<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.229> mouse<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.549> let's<00:02:02.579> say

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
clicking your mouse at all so let's say

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.359 
clicking your mouse at all so let's say
I<00:02:02.939> wanted<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.469> knock<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> guy's<00:02:04.770> head<00:02:04.950> off<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I wanted to knock the guy's head off I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
I wanted to knock the guy's head off I
could<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:06.119> I've<00:02:06.479> literally<00:02:06.899> only<00:02:07.170> used

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
could just use I've literally only used

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979 
could just use I've literally only used
the<00:02:07.590> mouse<00:02:07.710> wheel<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.330> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> press<00:02:09.869> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the mouse wheel you want to press in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.700 
the mouse wheel you want to press in
space<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.530> skip<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.830> turn<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
remover happen to know boom now the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.530 
remover happen to know boom now the
reason<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.220> bother<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.580> show<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.330> just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
reason I bother to show that is to just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.360 
reason I bother to show that is to just
answer<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.930> most<00:02:18.080> real<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.920> as

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
answer it the most real and just that as

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.170 
answer it the most real and just that as
if<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.000> set<00:02:20.180> up<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.330> party<00:02:20.600> going<00:02:20.870> limp<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:22.060> lot<00:02:23.060> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
if I set up a party going limp a lot of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
if I set up a party going limp a lot of
people<00:02:23.390> seem<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.690> miss<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.380> can<00:02:24.590> Pratt

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
people seem to miss that you can Pratt

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.130 
people seem to miss that you can Pratt
fair<00:02:25.580> enough<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.000> tutorial<00:02:26.420> doesn't<00:02:26.780> say<00:02:26.990> it

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
fair enough the tutorial doesn't say it

time that way you can see any details so
yeah<00:02:45.020> that's<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:46.070> basics<00:02:46.700> on<00:02:46.850> movement<00:02:47.210> I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
yeah that's the basics on movement I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240 
yeah that's the basics on movement I
mean<00:02:47.360> yeah<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.900> pretty<00:02:48.170> much<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.560> got<00:02:48.680> under

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
mean yeah you pretty much just got under

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.400 
mean yeah you pretty much just got under
V<00:02:49.550> also<00:02:49.910> grabs<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:50.690> they<00:02:50.810> doin<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
V also grabs but they doin that in the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.770 
V also grabs but they doin that in the
tutorial<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.300> definitely<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
tutorial that's you definitely want to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.500

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
play around with each joint because you

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.790 
play around with each joint because you
gotta<00:02:56.690> learn<00:02:56.840> what<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.110> do<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:57.590> they<00:02:57.680> do

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
when they go which way at certain angles

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.690 
when they go which way at certain angles
different<00:03:00.140> directions<00:03:00.800> what<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.520> do<00:03:01.610> when
