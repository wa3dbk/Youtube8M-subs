we will apply one of our two and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.530 
we will apply one of our two and
probability<00:01:07.530> formulas<00:01:08.390> since<00:01:09.390> the

the<00:01:11.790> second<00:01:12.180> draw<00:01:12.360> depends<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> whether<00:01:13.799> or

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the second draw depends on whether or

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
the second draw depends on whether or
not<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.369> white<00:01:14.580> ball<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> selected<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> the

not a white ball is selected on the
first<00:01:15.930> draw<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.280> events<00:01:17.520> are

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
first draw these two events are

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
first draw these two events are
dependent<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.380> apply<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> formula

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
dependent so we will apply the formula

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
dependent so we will apply the formula
for<00:01:20.580> dependent<00:01:21.060> events<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.689> rewrite<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
for dependent events and rewrite the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.149 
for dependent events and rewrite the
probability<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.580> follows<00:01:24.350> at<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.710> point<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
probability as follows at this point we

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.270 
probability as follows at this point we
can<00:01:26.310> calculate<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.270> probabilities

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
can calculate the two probabilities

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.679 
can calculate the two probabilities
first<00:01:29.280> we'll<00:01:29.549> find<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.060> probability<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
first we'll find the probability of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.399

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
remaining and two of them are white so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
remaining and two of them are white so
the<00:02:01.950> probability<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> selecting<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.360> white

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the probability of selecting a white

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
the probability of selecting a white
ball<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> second<00:02:04.590> draw<00:02:04.799> given<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
ball on the second draw given that a

ball on the second draw given that a
white<00:02:06.210> ball<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.600> selected<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> first<00:02:07.530> draw

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829

white ball is selected on the first draw
is<00:02:08.099> equal<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> 2<00:02:09.209> over<00:02:09.720> n<00:02:09.869> minus<00:02:09.899> 1

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
is equal to 2 over n minus 1

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.309 
is equal to 2 over n minus 1
when<00:02:12.040> we<00:02:12.189> set<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.609> equal<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.060> 112<00:02:13.689> we<00:02:14.109> see

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
when we set this equal to 112 we see

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.020 
when we set this equal to 112 we see
that<00:02:14.499> we<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.829> an<00:02:14.920> equation<00:02:15.249> we<00:02:15.609> can<00:02:15.790> solve

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
that we have an equation we can solve

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.229 
that we have an equation we can solve
for<00:02:16.389> n<00:02:16.829> first<00:02:17.829> we'll<00:02:18.129> simplify<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.700> left<00:02:18.999> hand

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
for n first we'll simplify the left hand

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.020 
for n first we'll simplify the left hand
side<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:20.620> we'll<00:02:20.889> cross<00:02:21.159> multiply<00:02:21.189> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
side then we'll cross multiply and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.229 
side then we'll cross multiply and
simplify<00:02:22.599> both<00:02:23.139> sides<00:02:23.730> since<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.969> is<00:02:25.209> a

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
simplify both sides since this is a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.390 
simplify both sides since this is a
quadratic<00:02:25.450> equation<00:02:25.989> we'll<00:02:26.739> set<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:26.980> equal<00:02:27.189> to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
quadratic equation we'll set it equal to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.970 
quadratic equation we'll set it equal to
0<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.719> we'll<00:02:28.930> factor<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.500> left-hand

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
0 and then we'll factor the left-hand

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.360 
0 and then we'll factor the left-hand
side<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.310> get<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.969> following<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:32.769> n<00:02:32.980> minus

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
side to get the following now if n minus

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.839 
side to get the following now if n minus
9<00:02:33.609> times<00:02:34.060> n<00:02:34.329> plus<00:02:34.359> 8<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.079> equal<00:02:35.139> to<00:02:35.560> 0<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.549> n

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
9 times n plus 8 is equal to 0 then n

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.440 
9 times n plus 8 is equal to 0 then n
must<00:02:37.090> equal<00:02:37.599> 9<00:02:37.930> or<00:02:38.290> negative<00:02:38.769> 8<00:02:39.299> since<00:02:40.299> n

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
must equal 9 or negative 8 since n

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.929 
must equal 9 or negative 8 since n
cannot<00:02:40.989> be<00:02:41.260> negative<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:41.950> question<00:02:42.459> we

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
cannot be negative in this question we

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.569 
cannot be negative in this question we
see<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.359> n<00:02:43.480> must<00:02:43.840> equal<00:02:44.290> 9<00:02:44.530> which<00:02:45.099> means<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
see that n must equal 9 which means the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.840 
see that n must equal 9 which means the
answer<00:02:45.909> here<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.389> d
