right just a quick demonstration on
Grand<00:00:04.680> Master<00:00:05.420> its<00:00:06.420> quadrant<00:00:06.810> program<00:00:07.550> I'll

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Grand Master its quadrant program I'll

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.330 
Grand Master its quadrant program I'll
kiss<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:08.940> here

so<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.730> when<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.389> loading<00:00:12.719> up<00:00:13.610> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
so now just when but it's loading up and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
so now just when but it's loading up and
this<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.089> layout<00:00:15.360> there's<00:00:15.839> roughly<00:00:16.170> forty

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this is my layout there's roughly forty

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.490 
this is my layout there's roughly forty
points<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> moment<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:19.050> set<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> old

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
points at the moment it's set the old

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.070 
points at the moment it's set the old
points<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> default<00:00:20.369> position<00:00:21.080> insert

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
points to the default position insert

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.410 
points to the default position insert
anywhere<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> given<00:00:25.350> over<00:00:26.420> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
anywhere you want it's given over and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.560 
anywhere you want it's given over and
this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.779> design<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> my<00:00:28.560> layout<00:00:29.269> it's<00:00:30.269> quite

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
this is a design of my layout it's quite

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.770 
this is a design of my layout it's quite
complex<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.679> graphic<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.600> and<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
complex the graphic about it is and you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
complex the graphic about it is and you
see<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.770> points<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.210> Direction<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
see the points you see Direction the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.580 
see the points you see Direction the
points<00:00:37.380> which<00:00:37.559> were<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> facing<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.350> that's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
points which were the facing and that's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
points which were the facing and that's
loaded<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.309> I'll<00:00:41.520> give<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> tour<00:00:42.149> run<00:00:42.360> your

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
loaded up I'll give you a tour run your

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.889 
loaded up I'll give you a tour run your
layout<00:00:43.969> at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> moment<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.480> still<00:00:45.539> set

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
layout at the moment it's still set

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.479 
layout at the moment it's still set
points<00:00:46.289> I'd<00:00:46.559> say<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> roughly<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
points I'd say the roughly on this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.450 
points I'd say the roughly on this
layout<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.210> forty<00:00:48.600> points<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.050> set

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.479 

and<00:00:57.550> done<00:00:58.210> right

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and done right

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.630 
and done right
as<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> points<00:01:01.730> over<00:01:02.730> there

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
as you can see on the points over there

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
as you can see on the points over there
so<00:01:05.640> left<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:09.720> shows<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> exactly

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so left and right it shows you exactly

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.249 
so left and right it shows you exactly
where<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:11.270> now<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> design<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.140> layout

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
where they are now to design the layout

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.040 
where they are now to design the layout
this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.040> layer<00:01:14.250> agency<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.090> quite<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
this is my layer agency it's quite a

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.190 
this is my layer agency it's quite a
complex<00:01:18.409> labels<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:20.420> until<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.720> ACH

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
complex labels in there until then ACH

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.490 
complex labels in there until then ACH
points<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:23.360> change<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.170> exactly

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
points here change then you know exactly

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.940 
points here change then you know exactly
we've<00:01:28.740> points<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.679> shall

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we've points are and then we shall

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
we've points are and then we shall
disclose<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.429> program<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.380> when<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
disclose the program down when it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.270 
disclose the program down when it
restarts<00:01:34.649> if<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:36.300> folks<00:01:36.509> say<00:01:37.280> now

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
restarts if it was see folks say now

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.260 
restarts if it was see folks say now
we're<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.789> design<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.149> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
we're going to design this is here you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.800 
we're going to design this is here you
got<00:01:42.390> evenings<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.899> track<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:45.660> we'll

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
got evenings on track right so we'll

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.180 
got evenings on track right so we'll
name<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.110> I'll<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.830> name<00:01:48.920> type<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> name

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
name it I'll get my name type a name

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.440 
name it I'll get my name type a name
here<00:01:50.490> I'll<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.149> test<00:01:52.429> feet

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.930 

and<00:01:56.860> close<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.700> test

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
and close that and this is the test

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.870 
and close that and this is the test
layout<00:01:59.270> now<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.020> design<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.740> layout<00:02:00.880> this

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
layout now to design the layout this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.969 
layout now to design the layout this
uses<00:02:02.150> straight<00:02:02.390> sections<00:02:02.870> even<00:02:03.500> particularly

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
uses straight sections even particularly

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.770 
uses straight sections even particularly
many<00:02:04.700> straight<00:02:05.000> sections<00:02:05.390> where<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.540> want

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
many straight sections where you want

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.169 
many straight sections where you want
one<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.890> loaded<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.310> for<00:02:07.550> struggling<00:02:08.060> down

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
one you loaded up for struggling down

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.420 
one you loaded up for struggling down
problem<00:02:09.110> into<00:02:09.259> place<00:02:10.150> it's<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.240> easy<00:02:12.430> but

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
problem into place it's so easy but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.210 
problem into place it's so easy but
remember<00:02:13.850> when<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.180> design<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.780> layout

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
remember when you design and layout

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.360 
remember when you design and layout
always<00:02:16.220> say<00:02:16.459> bit<00:02:16.700> 100%<00:02:18.430> put<00:02:19.430> these<00:02:19.690> in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
always say bit 100% put these in

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.710 
always say bit 100% put these in
that's<00:02:22.370> another<00:02:22.610> sunette<00:02:23.060> will<00:02:23.270> go<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that's another sunette will go to the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.260 
that's another sunette will go to the
curt's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
curt's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.309 
curt's
one<00:02:26.270> there<00:02:26.480> these<00:02:26.690> are<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.959> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> do

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
one there these are you going to do

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.449 
one there these are you going to do
single<00:02:27.580> put<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.820> there<00:02:29.950> number<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
single put one in there number one and

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.280 
single put one in there number one and
we'll<00:02:32.000> go<00:02:35.680> number<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:36.800> donor<00:02:38.170> which<00:02:39.170> is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
we'll go number one donor which is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.390 
we'll go number one donor which is
obviously<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> wrong<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.070> we<00:02:40.160> don't<00:02:40.310> need

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
obviously the wrong one we don't need

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.180 
obviously the wrong one we don't need
him<00:02:40.610> gone<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.590> that's<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> get

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
him gone to this on that's what I get

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.140 
him gone to this on that's what I get
it's<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.610> over<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:48.110> another<00:02:48.500> one<00:02:48.739> here

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
it's one over here and another one here

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's one over here and another one here
over<00:02:50.150> these<00:02:50.769> over<00:02:51.769> there

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
over these over there
