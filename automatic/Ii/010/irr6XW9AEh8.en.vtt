well in that soft spot that was like the
dip<00:02:06.869> spot<00:02:07.910> where<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> wouldn't<00:02:09.420> normally

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
dip spot where you wouldn't normally

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.229 
dip spot where you wouldn't normally
want<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> hit<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> car<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:11.640> impress<00:02:12.030> someone

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
want to hit the car to impress someone

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.300 
want to hit the car to impress someone
because<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
because it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.949 
because it
it's<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.550> in-between<00:02:15.090> gear<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.690> really

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
it's an in-between gear to just really

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.880 
it's an in-between gear to just really
kind<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.950> lugs<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.489> car<00:02:17.700> that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
kind of lugs the car that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.090 
kind of lugs the car that
they<00:02:19.460> do<00:02:19.520> very<00:02:19.940> well<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.870> even<00:02:21.560> if<00:02:21.650> those<00:02:21.770> look

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
they do very well and even if those look

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
they do very well and even if those look
spots<00:02:22.610> when<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.510> put<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> converter<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.290> them

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
spots when you put a converter in them

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980 
spots when you put a converter in them
here<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.100> again<00:02:25.250> at<00:02:25.520> like<00:02:25.640> 35<00:02:26.630> miles<00:02:26.870> an

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
here we are again at like 35 miles an

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.330 
here we are again at like 35 miles an
hour<00:02:27.110> 36<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.600> second<00:02:29.600> year<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.380> really

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
hour 36 a second year they just really

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.300 
hour 36 a second year they just really
accelerates<00:02:31.820> amazing

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.130 

and<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.360> show<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> same<00:02:36.870> thing

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and I'm going to show you the same thing

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.410 
and I'm going to show you the same thing
dropping<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.709> first<00:02:38.010> gear<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.550> we'll

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
dropping down the first gear and we'll

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.290 
dropping down the first gear and we'll
probably<00:02:39.569> get<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.840> little<00:02:39.900> wheel<00:02:40.110> spin<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.300> at

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
probably get a little wheel spin and at

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.290 
probably get a little wheel spin and at
25<00:02:42.720> miles<00:02:42.930> an<00:02:43.080> hour

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300

this<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> locking<00:03:46.420> converter<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.590> if<00:03:47.680> you

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
this is a locking converter but if you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.490 
this is a locking converter but if you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
use a used car around town a lot you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.770 
use a used car around town a lot you
will<00:03:50.650> get<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> little<00:03:51.040> worse<00:03:51.190> fuel<00:03:51.490> economy

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
will get a little worse fuel economy

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.720 
will get a little worse fuel economy
because<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.990> salt<00:03:53.709> install<00:03:54.100> is<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.340> little<00:03:54.610> bit

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
because the salt install is a little bit

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.090 
because the salt install is a little bit
softer<00:03:55.120> than<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.390> stock<00:03:55.630> nerve<00:03:56.050> but<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:56.980> got

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
softer than the stock nerve but you got

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.740 
softer than the stock nerve but you got
to<00:03:57.220> trade<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.459> little<00:03:57.760> bit<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.420> wonderful
