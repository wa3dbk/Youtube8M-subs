another audience that this event is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.850 
another audience that this event is
targeting<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.909> question<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.799> because<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
targeting the question is because you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
targeting the question is because you
have<00:01:49.979> different<00:01:50.070> levels<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.729> security<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.509> mean

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
have different levels of security I mean

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
have different levels of security I mean
in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> declassified<00:01:53.130> documents<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.700> we

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
in the declassified documents that we

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
in the declassified documents that we
have<00:01:54.619> really<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.299> top-secret<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.719> above<00:01:58.590> we

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
have really the top-secret and above we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
have really the top-secret and above we
have<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.189> few<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> those<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
have very few of those so the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.999 
have very few of those so the
declassified<00:02:01.350> documents<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.920> are

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
declassified documents that are

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
declassified documents that are
available<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.610> citizens<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> level

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
available to citizens are of the level

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.320 
available to citizens are of the level
of<00:02:04.140> secret<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
of secret and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.090 
of secret and
confidential<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:05.870> restricted<00:02:06.380> lower<00:02:06.650> levels

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
confidential and restricted lower levels

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.190 
confidential and restricted lower levels
they're<00:02:07.220> still<00:02:07.400> important<00:02:07.900> but<00:02:08.900> they're<00:02:09.080> not

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
they're still important but they're not

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.520 
they're still important but they're not
typically<00:02:10.330> very<00:02:11.330> few<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.780> are<00:02:11.900> actually<00:02:12.200> top

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
typically very few that are actually top

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.120 
typically very few that are actually top
secret<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:15.590> think<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:15.980> is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
secret and I think that this is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.640 
secret and I think that this is
significant<00:02:16.670> because<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:17.300> has<00:02:18.110> come<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.530> us

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
significant because what has come to us

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.950 
significant because what has come to us
are<00:02:18.920> some<00:02:19.490> lower<00:02:19.700> level<00:02:19.820> classified<00:02:20.600> debates

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
are some lower level classified debates

female<00:03:27.070> what<00:03:28.070> happened<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.670> July<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.650> 1945<00:03:30.650> we

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
female what happened in July of 1945 we

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.870 
female what happened in July of 1945 we
tested<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.910> bomb<00:03:32.330> white<00:03:33.019> sands<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:34.700> we

tested a bomb white sands and then we

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.500 
tested a bomb white sands and then we
dropped<00:03:35.209> two<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.230> August<00:03:36.709> on<00:03:36.890> Japan<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.730> I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
dropped two in August on Japan and I

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.930 
dropped two in August on Japan and I
believe<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.470> action<00:03:39.830> which<00:03:40.370> was<00:03:40.640> a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
believe that that action which was a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.540 
believe that that action which was a
nuclear<00:03:41.510> event<00:03:44.380> became<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> focus<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.280> this

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
nuclear event became a focus to this

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.940 
nuclear event became a focus to this
intelligence<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> therefore<00:03:48.500> that's<00:03:48.769> how

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
intelligence and therefore that's how

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.009 
intelligence and therefore that's how
the<00:03:49.010> government<00:03:49.280> became<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.330> intensely<00:03:50.840> aware

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
the government became so intensely aware

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.060 
the government became so intensely aware

President<00:04:21.470> Wilson<00:04:21.920> would<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.220> never<00:04:22.400> been

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
interested in phenomena that might

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.410 
interested in phenomena that might
involve<00:04:27.190> extra-terrestrial<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.910> think<00:04:29.330> the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
involve extra-terrestrial I think the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.050 
involve extra-terrestrial I think the
difference<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.380> we<00:04:31.190> really<00:04:31.490> only<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.940> our

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
difference is that we really only in our

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.520 
difference is that we really only in our
own<00:04:32.180> society<00:04:32.720> developed<00:04:33.110> much<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.380> a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
own society developed much of a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.740 
own society developed much of a
capability<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.340> detecting<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:35.210> mean<00:04:35.420> in<00:04:35.540> World

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
capability of detecting I mean in World

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.540 
capability of detecting I mean in World
War<00:04:35.810> two<00:04:36.050> we<00:04:36.170> get<00:04:36.260> radar<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.130> we<00:04:37.220> develop

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
War two we get radar so we develop

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.580 
War two we get radar so we develop
electronic<00:04:37.910> means<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.420> detection<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:38.990> for<00:04:39.530> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
electronic means of detection we for the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.290 
electronic means of detection we for the
first<00:04:39.770> time<00:04:39.950> ever<00:04:40.160> have<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.520> lot<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:41.030> people

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
first time ever have a lot of people

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.840 
first time ever have a lot of people
than<00:04:41.420> be<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.870> air<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:42.860> think<00:04:42.950> in<00:04:43.280> earlier

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
than be in the air so I think in earlier

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.730 
than be in the air so I think in earlier
times<00:04:44.120> it's<00:04:44.840> not<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.290> phenomenon

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
times it's not that this phenomenon

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.900 
times it's not that this phenomenon
didn't<00:04:46.010> happen<00:04:46.310> but<00:04:46.460> there<00:04:46.610> are<00:04:46.700> fewer

didn't happen but there are fewer

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.180 
didn't happen but there are fewer

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
of World War two there were three things
