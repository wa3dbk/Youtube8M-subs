00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.610
 Ricardo comes what we can call 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.380
 as the automotive event of the year that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.759
 they stopped of good airs and the anxieties 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 they are growing not only from the press 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.700
 specialized also public and first 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.439
 that the cars that start wanting to know 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.930
 what it's about arrived is a good idea 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.329
 the fort to give a previous question a 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.059
 advance of what they are going to present and with 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.100
 an attack of 13 really important if 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 the truth that we wanted to anticipate 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.899
 the letter the cataract of news that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.359
 It is always the autoshow in the case 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.480
 our will see even more news 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.980
 of these but we wanted to get ahead 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.929
 presenting you and through 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.699
 you to the Argentine public of what 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.929
 they treat the products that finally go 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.179
 to see the light and they will be in the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.710
 dealers very soon sometimes in the 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.199
 autoshow many things are presented 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.269
 many products and prototypes that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.860
 then they do not end up seeing the light here 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.810
 there are three who will do it and if 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 just the party mode the new focus 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.570
 and the new Cuba are three proud for 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.830
 those of party is 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 accommodate it in the design as to what 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.360
 which is the rider ki zero point blood 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 you see it mainly on the grill in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 the new grill that in takes for 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 those who already see cos by the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 street takes that line that you see in the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.760
 co sport of also these headlights more 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.130
 narrow forward a small line of 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.080
 chrome character under the window and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 follows some aspects regarding the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.670
 offer that today are not as is the box 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 Sequential automatic six 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 speeds created that customers us 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.950
 they asked for and surely some things 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.000
 we wanted to unveil, revealing the future 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 medium to know that the launch 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 perfect comes to reinforce what it does 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.110
 one in what takes for sale is a very 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.530
 good the truth that we are doing very well 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.660
 we keep growing think that what 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.979
 the year has already sold the same 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.020
 amount of party that we sold in all 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.310
 last year being a car that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 we sell only to the titanium version 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.600
 comes very equipped as you know and the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.459
 true that the car is a success and this 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.530
 is the third generation of games that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.020
 we are going to produce in Argentina there 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 by 2000 we started with the first 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.840
 focus series 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.459
 we are not presenting this new game 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380
 which is does not have a except the oval if 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.710
 you do not have 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.740
 it does not have a single piece of its predecessor 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.080
 a car that is going to have a quantity of 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.670
 new technological ages well above 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.690
 of what we are used to seeing in 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.610
 the segment c 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.820
 if one saw the intermediate segment c is 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.830
 very wide starts in in cars 1.6 with 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.020
 a fairly basic equipment and they arrive 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.470
 to vehicles are above 200 thousand 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.690
 pesos 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.190
 this car will be to compete with 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.680
 any of those cars and even with 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.480
 an offer of specifications a lot 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.640
 greater as for example is what 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.680
 I mentioned the assistant 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.510
 parking maybe something that today is not 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.340
 see is not seen in segment c by 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.170
 course it will be also we are 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.210
 our relationship with Paul until the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.190
 version plus also rights five 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.110
 doors to complete the line that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.000
 just the way to face that 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.620
 Ford has the whole world segment 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 explaining how is one by a vehicle 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.120
 which is produced in the factory in general to 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.460
 boy and that is coming commercially 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.280
 Very soon the truth is that much more 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.450
 faster than everyone expects 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.220
 just in the car show goes 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.340
 to be the place like to start 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.890
 present it to the best 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:31.690
 and with respect to the European aesthetically 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.340
 it's the same if the one ford and the development 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.680
 of global platforms you are looking for 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.319
 just have the cars that are 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.510
 similar in aesthetics itself by 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.640
 course you will find different 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.379
 types of equipment in different 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.940
 countries and Argentina is not going to be the 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.209
 section regarding that but 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.879
 specifically it is the same as the Cuba 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.680
 Cuba yes the truth that the car that 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.360
 we are seeing until today we were surprised 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 as we have been selling triple what 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 We thought we would sell when we started there 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.880
 for 2010 a car that really is a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.730
 aspiration to the fort I think if today 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.620
 I have to find a car that represents 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.170
 a forte is the Cuba 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.700
 and just this one comes to renew 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.379
 solving some questions that the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.660
 current version 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.480
 let's say it did not arrive 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.120
 and we are going to put everything happy and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.980
 satisfy everything to the customers that is the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.840
 trunk capacity and capacity 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.130
 interior of this car is much more 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.140
 big big they mainly more 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.000
 long what is just going to allow 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.370
 that a greater number of customers 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.800
 want to have as equipment level 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.840
 perhaps the most remarkable thing is that it comes 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.300
 with the humphrey the hands free 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.370
 trunk opening that is a nice site 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.160
 to have for those who carry 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.470
 women carrying bags or things the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.910
 come from the guys the backpacks come 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.310
 with the car pass the foot underneath 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.450
 paraguay with rear and that opens only 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.370
 you have to have the device of the 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.570
 pocket keys somewhere and good 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.830
 with that afterwards it also closes alone 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.310
 which is now a nice 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.220
 equipment to get this car already 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.500
 that if we continue to launch products that 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.450
 we are really proud we do not stop 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.300
 here the truth that they will continue to see 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.910
 news soon and the truth that all 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.070
 are with this level of exterior design 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.120
 this level of security and this level of 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.120
 technology thank you very much
