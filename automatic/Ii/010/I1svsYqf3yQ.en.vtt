00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.669

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.750
 had done the day before but did not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 stayed ball 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.800
 let's record having the car again 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.800
 whats the way 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.310
 the next 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.930
 I have a heart in my hand and I know by 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.530
 who wants to appear an interested person 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.530
 on motorcycle 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.820
 not interested, it is not decided that 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.600
 you know it's the most interesting of this one 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 Far-away guy. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 I 'm not talking about the amazon is not anymore 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:20.630
 a little close to the face of the reef 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.630
 he committed to get the bike 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.990
 les 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.179
 that's not what my heart is saying 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.179
 in 2009 a motorcycle that I took for me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.179
 used saw serious 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.140
 then the rectors to hymn 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.899
 and a half appears on the channel 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 Sometimes they just suck and sometimes they talk. 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 some truths there is not that side too 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.210
 sometimes motivates me to keep my bike at 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.210
 times motivates sells 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.420
 one of the memes that is coming up there guys 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 in relation to the oil bolt 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.829
 that letter he is exactly here 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.750
 below is not as I have spoken in 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.010
 another video and the staff complains that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.010
 scrapes do not know what 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.030
 Amd appeared there too. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.410
 water pump so far the left side is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 a real money, right? 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.300
 there we will vote the subject the bike of the sale 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.920
 motorcycle 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.959
 I am very satisfied with the bike in a 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 bike and I do not have bullshit I do not have 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.950
 her anger had to receive 500 per 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.260
 example that in my mother it was the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.319
 moto gastona I was surprising her 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.660
 this was the weakest motorcycle on the highway 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:18.350
 This is my opinion, and I have not 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:20.960
 I'll argue again, it's then. 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.200
 the heart is saying I will not be with 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200
 the motorcicle 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.180
 and there the great dilemma is not your look at 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.200
 back I see that even the guys are not 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.360
 raiders, right? 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.250
 ours and should have some problem that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.760
 I do not know what you'm not blind with bike 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 What about 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.569
 the branch you did not want it to be 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.569
 walking was done until now, right? 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.220
 if there I am 37 years old 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.090
 several bikes in the curriculum 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.090
 The rest for me is recalling that of catar 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.940
 Let's have a ride here to change some 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.330
 ideas there what you think is a 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.330
 light there 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.510
 The bike I 'm going to take I do not know what 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.670
 I'm not for civil 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.240
 seriously thinking or not 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.240
 Why was it so? 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.509
 it's complicated there 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.080
 this host gene 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:08.689
 the bike that was my dream of using the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:13.659
 china j6 right 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.659
 I got out and called the police. 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.200
 and so 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.750
 then it was thought that this was my 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.550
 consumer dream 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.990
 There, 90% of the time, it was because of 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.169
 things I was going to do right? 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.620
 The wand packs the car there to be without 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.949
 I got a loan and the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.949
 rolled 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.650
 but it's alright 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.270
 we will have a certain value had spoken of the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.900
 sell the bike to settle the bills 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.560
 I do not know if it's worth it 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.560
 this is another reason 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.900
 and that word we'll see there 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.020
 some suggestion opinion let us 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.020
 comments 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.460
 will be answered
