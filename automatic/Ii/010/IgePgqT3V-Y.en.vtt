you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.240> start<00:02:03.570> off<00:02:03.780> by<00:02:04.020> smoothing<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.950> hair

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.460 

to<00:02:08.250> show<00:02:08.460> us<00:02:08.550> how<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.760> get<00:02:09.030> rid<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:10.260> hair

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
to show us how to get rid of the hair

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:19.950 
to show us how to get rid of the hair
bump

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.680 

you'll<00:02:20.560> notice<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.540> nozzle<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
you'll notice that the nozzle of the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.220 
you'll notice that the nozzle of the
hair<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.830> pointing<00:02:24.490> down<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.300> hair<00:02:25.540> shaft<00:02:25.570> at

hair is pointing down the hair shaft at
all<00:02:26.380> time<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.810> you're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
all time this is so that you're

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.100 
all time this is so that you're
smoothing<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> cuticle<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.110> controlling

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
smoothing the cuticle and controlling

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.460 
smoothing the cuticle and controlling
the<00:02:32.290> hair<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.830> much<00:02:33.340> as<00:02:33.550> possible<00:02:34.260> notice<00:02:35.260> the

the hair of much as possible notice the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.130 
the hair of much as possible notice the
tension<00:02:36.070> she<00:02:36.340> puts<00:02:36.610> on<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.000> with<00:02:37.540> her<00:02:37.720> thumb

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
tension she puts on it with her thumb

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
tension she puts on it with her thumb
and<00:02:38.640> finger<00:02:39.690> pulling<00:02:40.690> quite<00:02:41.080> firmly<00:02:41.410> down<00:02:41.920> on

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and finger pulling quite firmly down on

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.750 
and finger pulling quite firmly down on
the<00:02:42.340> hair

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.449 

the<00:02:46.360> Moose<00:02:46.659> will<00:02:47.140> not<00:02:47.349> only<00:02:47.530> hold<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.189> hair

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the Moose will not only hold the hair

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.850 
the Moose will not only hold the hair
but<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> will<00:02:49.390> protect<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:50.620> heat<00:02:50.829> of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
but it will protect it in the heat of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.270 
but it will protect it in the heat of
the<00:02:51.129> hair<00:02:51.310> drive<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:51.849> well

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the hair drive as well

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.240 
the hair drive as well
so<00:02:54.270> all<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.350> hair<00:02:55.530> bumps<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.069> been

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
so all of the hair bumps have been

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
so all of the hair bumps have been
removed<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.000> even<00:02:57.810> though<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.140> hair<00:02:58.319> is

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
removed and even though the hair is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.980 
removed and even though the hair is
growing<00:02:58.709> into<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> center<00:02:59.660> using<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.810> mousse

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
growing into the center using the mousse

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.760

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
and the strong blow drying technique

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.540 
and the strong blow drying technique
will<00:03:04.770> keep<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.220> hair<00:03:05.459> very<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:06.510> smooth<00:03:07.550> if

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
will keep the hair very very smooth if

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.449 
will keep the hair very very smooth if
you<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:08.940> have<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.270> chance<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:10.220> wet<00:03:11.220> your

always keeping the ions moving so you're

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.509 
always keeping the ions moving so you're
gently<00:03:51.239> removing<00:03:51.900> any<00:03:52.380> excess<00:03:52.560> moisture<00:03:53.130> from
