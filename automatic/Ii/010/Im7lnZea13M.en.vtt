jump<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> sky<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.890> hit<00:01:23.070> like

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
jump to the sky and we would hit like

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.210 
jump to the sky and we would hit like
the<00:01:23.520> death<00:01:23.790> barrier<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.830> we'd<00:01:25.979> need<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
