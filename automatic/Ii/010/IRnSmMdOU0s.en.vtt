but you want to cut each wire separately

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
but you want to cut each wire separately
or<00:00:27.560> disconnect<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> battery<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.760> don't

your<00:00:41.070> new<00:00:41.219> antenna

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
your new antenna

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.690 
your new antenna
your<00:00:42.360> new<00:00:42.510> antenna<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.110> two<00:00:43.800> wires<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:44.520> mine

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
your new antenna has two wires well mine

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.979 
your new antenna has two wires well mine
has<00:00:44.879> two<00:00:45.059> wires<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.629> sure<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.930> many

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
has two wires I'm not sure how many

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.279 
has two wires I'm not sure how many
yours<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.559> mine<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.550> two<00:00:47.760> wires<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.360> read<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
yours has mine has two wires I read in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.400 
yours has mine has two wires I read in
the<00:00:49.379> blue<00:00:49.559> okay

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the blue okay

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.450 
the blue okay
the<00:00:52.410> blue<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:53.329> connects<00:00:56.809> connects<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the blue one connects connects to the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.810 
the blue one connects connects to the
orange<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.629> orange<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> yellow<00:01:01.260> wire

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
orange where the orange and yellow wire

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
orange where the orange and yellow wire
as<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.589> orange<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
as you see right there the orange and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.359 
as you see right there the orange and
yellow<00:01:05.630> okay

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
yellow okay

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.630 
yellow okay
that's<00:01:09.229> basically<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.380> signal<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.460> not

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that's basically just signal it's not

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.289 
that's basically just signal it's not
really<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.299> powers

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
really I'm not really sure what powers

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.340 
really I'm not really sure what powers
consisted<00:01:16.079> of<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.880> if<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> touches<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
consisted of but if it touches on it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.319 
consisted of but if it touches on it
hasn't<00:01:19.979> done<00:01:20.430> anything<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.270> sure

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
hasn't done anything so I'm not sure

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.590 
hasn't done anything so I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> signal<00:01:23.850> maybe

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
exactly I think it's just a signal maybe

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.169 
exactly I think it's just a signal maybe
it's<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:25.080> maybe<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.060> amber<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
it's more maybe than that but amber the

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.389 
it's more maybe than that but amber the
word<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:28.380> long<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> worked<00:01:28.920> all

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
word about as long as it worked all

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.410 
word about as long as it worked all
right<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.729> hope<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.939> blue<00:01:33.179> wire

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
right I hope this one up to my blue wire

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.060 
right I hope this one up to my blue wire
which<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.289> here<00:01:34.909> okay<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.929> then<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.560> red<00:01:37.770> wire

which is here okay and then my red wire

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.180 
which is here okay and then my red wire
which<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.119> power<00:01:40.009> wire<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.340> hooked<00:01:41.940> up<00:01:42.149> to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
which is my power wire I hooked up to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.929 
which is my power wire I hooked up to

what<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> hooked<00:02:02.189> mine<00:02:02.429> up<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:04.039> pretty<00:02:05.039> much

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
what I hooked mine up to and pretty much

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.029 
what I hooked mine up to and pretty much
after<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.640> turn<00:02:05.819> your<00:02:06.000> radio<00:02:06.090> off<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.959> on<00:02:07.229> and

let<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.310> cycle<00:02:08.720> everything<00:02:09.720> should<00:02:10.019> be<00:02:10.049> back

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
let it cycle everything should be back

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
let it cycle everything should be back
in<00:02:10.500> place<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.730> don't<00:02:11.970> forget<00:02:12.269> your<00:02:12.570> black
