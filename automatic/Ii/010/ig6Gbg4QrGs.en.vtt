00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.440
 works very different one modern 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.839
 dÃ­stico with vibrant colors and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.059
 contrasting and one more calm with 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.129
 muted colors of guy knows that you 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.260
 like it so much now this is on purpose 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.110
 so they can see all the virtues that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.150
 has this technique that we do not limit ourselves 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.309
 in always doing the same good thing today 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.199
 let's use two brushes some treatments 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.449
 one centimeter plus or minus one centimeter 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 and half for the wings of the butterfly and 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.510
 a redondito brush for the body of the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.670
 same we are going today we also add a 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 color a third color different to how 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 we were working that always 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 we had been 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.270
 with two colors 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.540
 same procedure always remember 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 which are very important mojo dried cargo 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.300
 the brush on one side I charge for the other 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 I arrange the colors in the palette I'm going 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.040
 to do the first brushstroke so that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 see what is enciso is and then we have 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 directly to the butterfly I go with the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.910
 tip brush I stretch and return with 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.050
 the tip brush and we take it 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.920
 directly to the butterfly first thing 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.600
 what am I going to do 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.960
 they are two triangles for the part 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960
 higher 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.550
 two rhombs for the bottom part this 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 it will serve as a guide 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.680
 Now I'm going with the tipped brush 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.620
 and I come to the point brush tip 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.860
 I squeeze and I come back with the dotted brush 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.940
 I repeat the same thing I reload the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.300
 brush from one side of the other accommodated 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.690
 brush from tip to tip to tip 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.300
 since this is repetitive but see what 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.430
 easy is the butterfly coming out and what 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.069
 decorative that remains 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.260
 I'm going to renew the color of light today I had 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.379
 pink now I'm going to put my life 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.450
 and that of a magenta side of the other accommodation 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.010
 the colors with the palette and I go back to 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 do the same procedure 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.659
 giving volume to the yellow 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.390
 every time I make a new layer I'll 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.219
 shrinking the size of the brush stroke to 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.260
 the little body of it I will load the 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.510
 brush on one side and the other 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.640
 I'll make a chiquitita eat predicament 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 and he picked up and I lift I have the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.639
 head squeezed and lifted squeezed and 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.760
 I raise and I have the body then I reserve 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.129
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.450
 careless I tell them if they want 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.209
 communicate with me that they do it through 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.040
