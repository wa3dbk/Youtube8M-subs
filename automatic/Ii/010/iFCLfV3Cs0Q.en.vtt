to<00:00:20.670> an<00:00:20.789> aluminum<00:00:21.000> plate<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.750> z-axis<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
to an aluminum plate to my z-axis and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
to an aluminum plate to my z-axis and
then<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> did<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.810> created<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
then what I did is I created out of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.580 
then what I did is I created out of
lexan<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:26.970> acrylic<00:00:27.590> polycarbonate

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
lexan you can use acrylic polycarbonate

lexan you can use acrylic polycarbonate
you<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.890> there's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> material<00:00:29.820> out

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you know there's a lot of material out

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.730 
you know there's a lot of material out
there<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.390> believe<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> quarter

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
there I believe this is about a quarter

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.659 
there I believe this is about a quarter
of<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.040> inch<00:00:32.130> thick

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
of an inch thick

skirts and then out of the same material
I<00:01:05.030> create<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.330> dust<00:01:06.720> kurt<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.670> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I create a dust kurt if you will this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.660 
I create a dust kurt if you will this
one<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.299> has<00:01:10.280> plastic<00:01:11.280> bristles

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
one as you can see has plastic bristles

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270 
one as you can see has plastic bristles
that<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.200> use<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.680> come<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> all

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that you can use and they come in all

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
that you can use and they come in all
different<00:01:14.850> lengths<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.650> different<00:01:17.040> materials

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
this is plastic you can get them out of

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
this is plastic you can get them out of
horsehair<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.030> believe<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.259> couple

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
horsehair I believe and there's a couple

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
horsehair I believe and there's a couple
of<00:01:22.650> others<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> know

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of others out there and I just you know

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
of others out there and I just you know
in<00:01:24.540> SolidWorks<00:01:25.020> designed<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> model<00:01:25.619> created

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
in SolidWorks designed the model created

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.810 
in SolidWorks designed the model created
a<00:01:26.220> groove<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.890> put<00:01:28.890> those<00:01:29.040> bristles<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
a groove and put those bristles in there

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
a groove and put those bristles in there
as<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> same

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
as you can see and then just the same

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.609 
as you can see and then just the same
holes<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.210> line<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> couple<00:01:34.530> of

holes to line up with a couple of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.760 
holes to line up with a couple of
additional<00:01:34.829> magnets<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.759> bolt<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.770> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
additional magnets that then bolt on to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.060 
additional magnets that then bolt on to
the<00:01:37.890> side<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> machine<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.920> can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the side of the machine so as you can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
the side of the machine so as you can
see<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.700> quite<00:01:42.030> easy<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.079> take<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
see it's quite easy to take this and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.880 
see it's quite easy to take this and
quite<00:01:44.280> easily<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.619> attach<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
quite easily just like that attach it to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
quite easily just like that attach it to
the<00:01:46.979> machine<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> very

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the machine and you have a very

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.800 
the machine and you have a very
effective<00:01:49.220> dust<00:01:50.220> extraction<00:01:50.640> hood<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
effective dust extraction hood now you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
effective dust extraction hood now you
can<00:01:52.140> obviously<00:01:52.560> depending<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.310> depth<00:01:53.549> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
can obviously depending on your depth of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
can obviously depending on your depth of
cut<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.720> tools<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.950> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
cut then the tools that you use you can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.870 
cut then the tools that you use you can
make<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:57.240> longer<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:57.869> make<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.320> shorter

make this longer or make them shorter

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
make this longer or make them shorter
very<00:01:59.880> easy<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> remove<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.810> attach<00:02:01.140> I'll<00:02:01.560> show

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
very easy to remove and attach I'll show

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.380 
very easy to remove and attach I'll show
you<00:02:02.189> another<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.219> see

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you another one here and as you can see

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.859 
you another one here and as you can see
same<00:02:06.390> design<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.489> shorter<00:02:09.020> bristles

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
same design but a lot shorter bristles

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.650 
same design but a lot shorter bristles
very<00:02:11.440> very<00:02:11.739> flexible<00:02:11.980> as<00:02:12.459> well<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.540> I'm

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
very very flexible as well so if I'm

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.150 
very very flexible as well so if I'm
cutting<00:02:13.989> something<00:02:14.230> which<00:02:14.500> your<00:02:14.680> car<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.980> my

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
cutting something which your car is my

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.750 
cutting something which your car is my
z-axis<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.269> be<00:02:16.800> closer<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.280> part<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.670> I'm

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
z-axis to be closer to the part that I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.780 
z-axis to be closer to the part that I'm
cutting<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.720> easily<00:02:20.050> change<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
cutting I can easily change out the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.089 
cutting I can easily change out the
different<00:02:22.120> length<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.450> bristles<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.920> very

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
different length of bristles and be very

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.490 
different length of bristles and be very
effective<00:02:24.660> these<00:02:25.660> are<00:02:25.840> things<00:02:26.140> are<00:02:26.260> also<00:02:26.379> very

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
effective these are things are also very

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.280 
effective these are things are also very
flexible<00:02:27.280> as<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.640> can<00:02:27.790> see<00:02:27.940> here<00:02:28.180> they<00:02:29.080> can

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
flexible as you can see here they can

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.699 
flexible as you can see here they can
bend<00:02:29.500> quite<00:02:29.799> easily<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:32.019> know<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.349> again<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
bend quite easily you know and again you

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.140 
bend quite easily you know and again you
can<00:02:32.860> get<00:02:33.040> different<00:02:33.430> materials<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
can get different materials and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.460 
can get different materials and
depending<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.690> how<00:02:35.470> long<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.989> how<00:02:37.989> soft<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
depending on how long and how soft the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.839 
depending on how long and how soft the
bristles<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.370> even<00:02:39.580> get<00:02:39.700> more

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
bristles are you can even get more

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.970 
bristles are you can even get more
flexibility<00:02:40.540> but<00:02:40.660> as<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.989> see<00:02:41.140> here<00:02:41.440> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
flexibility but as you can see here you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.589 
flexibility but as you can see here you
know<00:02:42.099> if<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.549> any<00:02:42.730> sort<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.030> clamps<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
know if I have any sort of clamps on the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.240 
know if I have any sort of clamps on the
table<00:02:44.019> let<00:02:44.829> me<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.069> grab<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> clamp<00:02:45.579> here<00:02:47.250> you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
table let me just grab a clamp here you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.410 
table let me just grab a clamp here you
know<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.489> I'm<00:02:48.579> holding<00:02:48.760> material<00:02:49.299> down

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
know that I'm holding material down

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500 
know that I'm holding material down
let's<00:02:49.660> say<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.930> example<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.880> quite<00:02:52.329> easily

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
let's say for example this quite easily

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.020 
let's say for example this quite easily
will<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:52.930> over<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> clamp<00:02:53.530> okay<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.849> there's

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
will go over the clamp okay and there's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.420 
will go over the clamp okay and there's
no<00:02:55.269> no<00:02:55.750> interference<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:57.010> works<00:02:57.220> quite

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
no no interference so it works quite

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.180 
no no interference so it works quite
well<00:02:57.900> another<00:02:58.900> material<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.709> I've<00:03:00.040> actually

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
well another material that I've actually

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.470 
well another material that I've actually
experimented<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.950> some<00:03:02.950> plastic<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.000> as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
experimented with is some plastic and as

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.140 
experimented with is some plastic and as
you<00:03:04.599> can<00:03:04.720> see<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.049> can<00:03:05.200> see<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.500> here<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:06.150> very

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you can see you can see that here a very

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.030 
you can see you can see that here a very
very<00:03:07.239> flexible<00:03:07.660> plastic<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.680> cut<00:03:08.829> some

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
very flexible plastic I just cut some

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.940 
very flexible plastic I just cut some
slits<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.030> same<00:03:10.390> design<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:11.739> one

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
slits in it same design this one

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.569 
slits in it same design this one
actually<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.640> used<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.629> couple<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.459> sheet<00:03:15.459> metal

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
actually I used a couple of sheet metal

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.840 
actually I used a couple of sheet metal
screws<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.389> attach<00:03:16.590> after<00:03:17.590> stretching<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.160> and

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
screws to attach after stretching it and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.590 
screws to attach after stretching it and
I<00:03:18.940> gotta<00:03:19.090> say<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.690> also<00:03:19.900> quite<00:03:20.319> effective

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
I gotta say this is also quite effective

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.449 
I gotta say this is also quite effective
not<00:03:22.600> as<00:03:22.780> effective<00:03:23.380> as<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> bristles<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.160> found

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
not as effective as the bristles I found

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.520 
not as effective as the bristles I found
but<00:03:25.060> again<00:03:25.359> it<00:03:25.480> depends<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.049> material

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
but again it depends on the material

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.490 
but again it depends on the material
you're<00:03:26.680> cutting<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:28.480> plastic<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.049> is<00:03:29.230> just

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
you're cutting for plastic this is just

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.770 
you're cutting for plastic this is just
fine<00:03:29.799> because<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:31.030> know<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.510> don't<00:03:31.630> have

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
fine because you know you don't have

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.309 
fine because you know you don't have
that<00:03:31.859> fine<00:03:32.859> particle<00:03:33.459> creation<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:35.260> if

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
that fine particle creation obviously if

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.349 
that fine particle creation obviously if
you're<00:03:35.470> machining<00:03:35.950> MDF<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.639> would<00:03:37.120> certainly

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
you're machining MDF I would certainly

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.809 
you're machining MDF I would certainly
recommend<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:38.230> bristle<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.700> will

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
recommend a bristle one as it will

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819 
recommend a bristle one as it will
contain<00:03:40.209> more<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.690> dust<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.079> this<00:03:41.620> is

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
contain more of the dust and this is

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.430 
contain more of the dust and this is
quite<00:03:42.370> quite<00:03:42.910> more<00:03:43.299> flexible<00:03:43.870> as<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.109> can<00:03:44.260> see

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
quite quite more flexible as you can see

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.690 
quite quite more flexible as you can see
you<00:03:44.680> can<00:03:44.829> get<00:03:45.010> really<00:03:45.250> really<00:03:45.400> flat<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.700> again

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
you can get really really flat so again

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.690 
you can get really really flat so again
with<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.690> creation<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.260> up<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.340> design

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
with the creation of up of this design

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.210 
with the creation of up of this design
here<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.329> can<00:03:52.480> easily<00:03:52.870> play<00:03:53.349> around<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:54.130> know

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
here you can easily play around you know

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.930 
here you can easily play around you know
with<00:03:54.370> different<00:03:54.790> material<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:56.620> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
with different material and like that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.140 
with different material and like that
quite<00:03:57.940> easily<00:03:58.889> attach<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> VFD

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
quite easily attach it to the VFD

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.870 
quite easily attach it to the VFD
spindle<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.919> then<00:04:02.919> you<00:04:03.280> know<00:04:03.400> quite<00:04:03.669> easily

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
spindle and then you know quite easily

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.309 
spindle and then you know quite easily
take<00:04:04.329> that<00:04:04.510> off<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:05.280> as<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.430> can<00:04:06.579> see<00:04:07.319> there's

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
take that off and as you can see there's

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.280 
take that off and as you can see there's
a<00:04:08.410> lot<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.799> clearance<00:04:09.540> for<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:10.930> able<00:04:11.049> to

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
a lot of clearance for you to be able to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.569 
a lot of clearance for you to be able to
then<00:04:11.440> change<00:04:11.739> your<00:04:11.829> tools<00:04:13.919> you<00:04:14.919> know<00:04:15.010> zero<00:04:15.400> out

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
then change your tools you know zero out

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.849 
then change your tools you know zero out
the<00:04:15.790> machine<00:04:16.180> especially<00:04:17.049> we<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.560> touch

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
the machine especially we have touch

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.810 
the machine especially we have touch
probes<00:04:18.390> whatnot<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:20.400> then<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.609> quite

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
probes whatnot and then just quite

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.330 
probes whatnot and then just quite
simply<00:04:22.210> again<00:04:22.450> when<00:04:22.599> you're<00:04:22.719> ready<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.050> cut

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
simply again when you're ready to cut

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.260 
simply again when you're ready to cut
put<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.430> dust<00:04:24.640> Kurt

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
put the dust Kurt

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.110 
put the dust Kurt
rather<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.780> machine<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.289> off<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.740> go<00:04:27.120> okay

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
rather the machine and off you go okay

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.550 
rather the machine and off you go okay
so<00:04:29.220> again<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.400> short<00:04:30.789> video<00:04:31.000> people<00:04:31.990> have<00:04:32.199> asked

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so again a short video people have asked

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.830 
so again a short video people have asked
us<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.789> what<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.819> might<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.180> doing<00:04:34.360> for<00:04:34.660> dust

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
us to what I might be doing for dust

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.170 
us to what I might be doing for dust
extraction<00:04:35.259> and<00:04:35.500> this<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.889> system<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:37.150> I

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
extraction and this is the system that I

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.390 
extraction and this is the system that I
came<00:04:37.270> up<00:04:37.419> with<00:04:37.569> now<00:04:38.319> obviously<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:38.889> can<00:04:38.919> make

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
came up with now obviously you can make

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.960 
came up with now obviously you can make
this<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:40.590> lot<00:04:41.590> longer<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:42.160> can<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.849> know

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
this a lot longer you can you know

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.279 
this a lot longer you can you know
obviously<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.449> can<00:04:43.569> make<00:04:43.599> this<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.900> lot<00:04:44.110> longer

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
obviously you can make this a lot longer

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.550 
obviously you can make this a lot longer
if<00:04:45.009> you<00:04:45.160> wanted<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.610> if<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.270> have<00:04:46.539> bigger<00:04:47.229> four

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
if you wanted to if you have bigger four

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.029 
if you wanted to if you have bigger four
inch<00:04:47.710> hose<00:04:48.990> extraction<00:04:49.990> tools<00:04:50.199> here<00:04:50.500> easily

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
inch hose extraction tools here easily

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.559 
inch hose extraction tools here easily
you<00:04:51.160> can<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.759> know<00:04:51.849> extend<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:52.360> out<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:55.210> you

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
you can you know extend this out if you

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.050 
you can you know extend this out if you
do<00:04:55.750> that<00:04:56.080> if<00:04:56.349> you<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.889> I<00:04:57.130> would<00:04:57.550> think<00:04:57.970> that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
do that if you do so I would think that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.149 
do that if you do so I would think that
that<00:04:58.690> would<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.139> need<00:04:59.319> for<00:04:59.650> maybe<00:05:00.069> a

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
that would be the need for maybe a

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:01.950 
that would be the need for maybe a
bracket<00:05:00.699> going<00:05:01.120> down<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.509> give<00:05:01.659> you<00:05:01.690> some

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
bracket going down to give you some

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960 
bracket going down to give you some
additional<00:05:02.199> support<00:05:02.860> here<00:05:03.099> again<00:05:03.819> there's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
additional support here again there's

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.870 
additional support here again there's
not<00:05:04.180> really<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:04.930> much<00:05:05.139> support<00:05:05.590> needed<00:05:05.880> but

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
not really that much support needed but

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.100 
not really that much support needed but
if<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.090> do<00:05:07.210> make<00:05:07.389> this<00:05:07.539> thing<00:05:07.720> longer

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
if you do make this thing longer

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.320 
if you do make this thing longer
especially<00:05:09.009> with<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.550> weight<00:05:09.729> of<00:05:09.759> the<00:05:09.909> vacuum

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330

is you might just you know additionally

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.290 
is you might just you know additionally
need<00:05:14.380> maybe<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.680> little<00:05:14.860> bit<00:05:15.069> of<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.460> of

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
additional support I haven't needed that

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.129 
additional support I haven't needed that
as<00:05:23.199> you<00:05:23.289> can<00:05:23.440> see<00:05:23.620> mine<00:05:23.830> works<00:05:24.490> quite<00:05:24.759> well<00:05:25.139> the

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.230 
you don't want anything grinding end up
you<00:05:41.889> know<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.009> offset<00:05:42.280> at<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.669> magnets<00:05:43.060> here<00:05:43.210> a

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
you know I offset at the magnets here a

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.680 
you know I offset at the magnets here a
little<00:05:43.479> bit<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:44.469> when<00:05:44.650> this<00:05:45.190> part<00:05:45.969> here<00:05:46.389> mates

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
little bit so when this part here mates

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.320 
little bit so when this part here mates
with<00:05:46.900> this<00:05:47.050> part<00:05:47.380> it<00:05:47.969> automatically<00:05:48.969> aligns

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
with this part it automatically aligns

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330 
with this part it automatically aligns
just<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.169> know<00:05:50.259> just<00:05:50.500> putting<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.949> magnet

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
just you know just putting the magnet

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.689 
just you know just putting the magnet
maybe<00:05:51.729> an<00:05:51.909> 1/16<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.900> an<00:05:53.050> inch<00:05:53.139> deeper<00:05:53.620> here<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
maybe an 1/16 of an inch deeper here and

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.390 
maybe an 1/16 of an inch deeper here and
leaving<00:05:54.880> this<00:05:55.120> magnet<00:05:55.599> on<00:05:55.719> top<00:05:55.870> of<00:05:56.020> this<00:05:56.400> 1/16

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
leaving this magnet on top of this 1/16

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.809 
leaving this magnet on top of this 1/16
of<00:05:57.520> an<00:05:57.699> inch<00:05:58.800> outside<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.919> that<00:06:00.039> hole<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.520> you

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
of an inch outside of that hole and you

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.370 
of an inch outside of that hole and you
can<00:06:00.940> easily<00:06:01.240> control<00:06:01.509> obviously<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.169> depth

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
can easily control obviously the depth

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.659 
can easily control obviously the depth
of<00:06:02.530> this<00:06:02.650> holes<00:06:02.860> especially<00:06:03.340> if<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:03.550> machine

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
of this holes especially if you machine

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.260 
of this holes especially if you machine
this<00:06:04.000> on<00:06:04.449> your<00:06:04.719> CNC<00:06:05.110> machine<00:06:05.440> so<00:06:05.979> it<00:06:06.190> very<00:06:06.699> very

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
this on your CNC machine so it very very
