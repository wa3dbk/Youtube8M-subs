I thought is certainly do for an update
so<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.420> really<00:00:43.539> doesn't<00:00:43.750> come<00:00:43.960> as<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.140> surprise

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
so it really doesn't come as a surprise

September of 2013 I know this image is
actually<00:00:54.820> really<00:00:55.149> exciting<00:00:55.600> for<00:00:55.780> me<00:00:55.809> because

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
actually really exciting for me because

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.750 
actually really exciting for me because
I<00:00:56.530> think<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:56.890> proves<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.309> Apple<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.730> to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
I think it proves the Apple is to

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.490 
I think it proves the Apple is to
working<00:00:58.210> on<00:00:58.300> ipods<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.929> they<00:00:59.199> might<00:00:59.379> be

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
working on ipods and they might be

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200 
working on ipods and they might be
planning<00:00:59.710> show<00:01:00.070> off<00:01:00.160> some<00:01:00.219> redesigned<00:01:00.789> models

it<00:01:05.530> would<00:01:05.620> make<00:01:05.740> sense<00:01:05.770> they<00:01:06.100> might<00:01:06.280> also<00:01:06.430> want

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
it would make sense they might also want

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.160 
it would make sense they might also want
to<00:01:06.700> give<00:01:06.790> them<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:07.060> minor<00:01:07.270> update<00:01:07.750> may<00:01:07.960> be<00:01:08.020> in

to give them a minor update may be in

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.780 
to give them a minor update may be in
the<00:01:08.260> form<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.500> slightly<00:01:08.710> slimmer<00:01:08.980> cases<00:01:09.580> or

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
the form of slightly slimmer cases or

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.520 
the form of slightly slimmer cases or
additional<00:01:10.390> features<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:10.870> functionality

additional features and functionality

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.230 
additional features and functionality
with<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.040> said<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.640> can<00:01:12.790> see<00:01:12.910> from<00:01:13.090> these

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
with that said as you can see from these

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.850 
with that said as you can see from these
pictures<00:01:13.660> they<00:01:13.690> really<00:01:14.140> don't<00:01:14.380> show<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.620> very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
pictures they really don't show a very

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.170 
pictures they really don't show a very
different<00:01:15.220> ipod<00:01:15.490> lineup<00:01:15.760> for<00:01:15.910> what<00:01:16.030> we've

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
different ipod lineup for what we've

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.790 
different ipod lineup for what we've
seen<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.480> past<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:17.110> fact<00:01:17.350> they<00:01:17.650> look

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
seen in the past in fact they look

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800 
seen in the past in fact they look
pretty<00:01:17.950> much<00:01:18.100> identical<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:19.030> today's<00:01:19.330> ipods

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
pretty much identical to today's ipods

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.660 
pretty much identical to today's ipods
except<00:01:20.470> obviously<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.160> redesigned

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
except obviously with the redesigned

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.090 
except obviously with the redesigned
colors<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:22.660> i<00:01:22.690> think<00:01:22.990> with<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.560> mind<00:01:23.590> I'm

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
colors so i think with that in mind I'm

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.040 
colors so i think with that in mind I'm
not<00:01:24.220> expecting<00:01:24.550> Apple<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.240> change<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.870> design

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
not expecting Apple to change the design

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.440 
not expecting Apple to change the design
or<00:01:26.470> form<00:01:26.800> factors<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> ipods<00:01:27.760> as<00:01:27.970> they

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
or form factors of the ipods as they

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.360 
or form factors of the ipods as they
have<00:01:28.630> done<00:01:28.660> in<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> past<00:01:29.260> but<00:01:29.890> again<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.310> do
