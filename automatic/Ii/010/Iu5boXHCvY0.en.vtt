00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

right<00:00:00.740> alright<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.040> our<00:00:02.370> first<00:00:02.760> video

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
right alright this is our first video

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.039 
right alright this is our first video
with<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.170> last<00:00:04.410> four<00:00:04.859> trials<00:00:05.420> but<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:06.629> plan<00:00:06.899> on

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
with the last four trials but we plan on

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.640 
with the last four trials but we plan on
doing<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:07.710> everyone<00:00:07.950> eventually<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> of

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
doing it for everyone eventually so of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
doing it for everyone eventually so of
course<00:00:10.889> its<00:00:11.190> guile<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.420> was<00:00:12.750> really

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
course its guile because I was really

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.860 
course its guile because I was really
first<00:00:13.620> person<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.040> even<00:00:14.099> try<00:00:14.400> last<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
first person to even try last for so I

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.480 
first person to even try last for so I
guess<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.379> doesn't<00:00:16.529> really<00:00:16.680> say<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.250> much

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
guess it doesn't really say that much

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
guess it doesn't really say that much
but<00:00:17.850> already<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.869> into<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.350> we're<00:00:19.500> going

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
but already get into it and we're going

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.150 
but already get into it and we're going
to<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.420> double<00:00:21.420> play<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.769> ones<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.010> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to have a double play of the ones that I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
to have a double play of the ones that I
think<00:00:23.430> need<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.850> double<00:00:24.269> plate<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.720> ones

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
think need to be double plate or ones

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
think need to be double plate or ones
that<00:00:25.350> actually<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.039> complicated<00:00:26.220> i

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that actually are a little complicated i

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.259 
that actually are a little complicated i
mean<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.000> first<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:28.220> yeah<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.820> in

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
mean this first one yeah that that's in

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.930 
mean this first one yeah that that's in
the<00:00:30.420> ranks<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.430> like<00:00:32.430> video<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the ranks with the first like video we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.520 
the ranks with the first like video we
made<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.780> complicated<00:00:34.170> as

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
made it it's not that complicated as

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
made it it's not that complicated as
long<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.329> while

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
long as you know to do it like while

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290 
long as you know to do it like while
they're<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> top<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.770> bad<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:39.090> one

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
they're at the top it's not bad this one

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
they're at the top it's not bad this one
is<00:00:39.510> uh<00:00:39.540> where<00:00:40.379> things<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.710> start

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
is uh where things actually start

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.069 
is uh where things actually start
getting<00:00:41.340> complicated<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.719> one's<00:00:42.930> not

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
getting complicated and that one's not

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
getting complicated and that one's not
even<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> bad<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.040> uh<00:00:44.510> still<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
even that bad but uh still gonna see it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.729 
even that bad but uh still gonna see it
again<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:46.770> sure<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.250> um

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
again you just got to make sure that um

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.459 
again you just got to make sure that um
you<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.079> doing<00:00:52.079> normal

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you really are good at doing normal

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.119 
you really are good at doing normal
little<00:00:53.190> moves<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> chain<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
little moves into the chain because a

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.290 
little moves into the chain because a
lot<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.250> build<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> barrier<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> her

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lot of people build up a barrier in her

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.470 
lot of people build up a barrier in her
head<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.660> can't<00:00:57.899> normal<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.620> chain

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
head and they can't normal into chain

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
head and they can't normal into chain
this<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.160> actually<00:01:02.160> definitely<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.730> as

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this one a actually definitely not as

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.560 
this one a actually definitely not as
hard<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> looks<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.860> fun<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> do

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
hard as it looks just very fun to do

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
hard as it looks just very fun to do
worst<00:01:06.570> part<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> probably<00:01:07.170> making<00:01:07.500> sure<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
worst part is probably making sure you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
worst part is probably making sure you
uh<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.270> first<00:01:09.570> DX<00:01:09.900> sonic<00:01:10.200> boom<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.530> close

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
uh get your first DX sonic boom as close

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
uh get your first DX sonic boom as close
as<00:01:10.920> possible<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> rest<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.060> flows<00:01:12.600> out

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
as possible and the rest just flows out

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
as possible and the rest just flows out
I<00:01:13.229> mean<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:13.860> give<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> shot<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.119> as

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I mean really give it a shot it's not as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
I mean really give it a shot it's not as
bad<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.380> you'd<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:20.220> right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bad as you'd think it would be all right

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
bad as you'd think it would be all right
and<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.670> last<00:01:23.880> one

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and this is the last one

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
and this is the last one
and<00:01:26.030> man<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> look<00:01:27.539> pretty<00:01:27.869> no<00:01:28.289> I<00:01:28.490> think

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and man does it look pretty no I think

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
and man does it look pretty no I think
the<00:01:29.609> worst<00:01:29.789> part<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.359> split<00:01:30.719> in<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:31.020> parts

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the worst part here I split in two parts

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.559 
the worst part here I split in two parts
there's<00:01:31.619> pre<00:01:32.159> sonic<00:01:32.670> boom<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> after<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
there's pre sonic boom and after and

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.010 
there's pre sonic boom and after and
after<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.710> actually<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> hard<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
after is where actually is hard and the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
after is where actually is hard and the
hardest<00:01:37.319> part<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.679> going<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> high

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
hardest part is just going from the high

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
hardest part is just going from the high
kick<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> crouching<00:01:39.600> mediums<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
kick to the crouching mediums and the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.559 
kick to the crouching mediums and the
second<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:41.429> do<00:01:41.549> high<00:01:41.729> kick<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.179> just<00:01:42.360> start

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
second you do high kick you just start

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.270 
second you do high kick you just start
holding<00:01:42.719> down<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.219> your

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
holding down back so you can get your

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.910 
holding down back so you can get your
charge<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.850> Sonic<00:01:45.179> hurricane<00:01:45.569> in<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
charge for Sonic hurricane in a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.260 
charge for Sonic hurricane in a
crouching<00:01:46.920> mediums<00:01:47.369> juggle<00:01:47.789> pretty<00:01:48.090> well

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
crouching mediums juggle pretty well

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
crouching mediums juggle pretty well
into<00:01:48.569> each<00:01:48.689> other<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.409> first<00:01:49.649> catch<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
into each other and the first catch is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.130 
into each other and the first catch is
probably<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.090> most<00:01:51.149> annoying<00:01:51.509> part<00:01:51.840> but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
probably the most annoying part but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
probably the most annoying part but
