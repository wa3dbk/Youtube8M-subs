00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.010
 we used the speech so we started by typing the cardboard 3ds 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.320
 then we will wear a base circle 32 artists 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.719
 we will turn to us 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.109
 we go into edit mode they select everything and then we will create a 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.519
 entertainment segment without maintaining control by clicking here 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.470
 once for the first point 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.529
 then a second time for the second point 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.000
 then we select its high points capitalized plus preselection 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.669
 seasoned 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.919
 then we go 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.730
 so make sure that this segment is 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 on the same axis as the simple how to escape control 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 to make it coincide correctly 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 then we will mount this artifice 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 and we'll go down a little bit this one 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.820
 so in fact this company we will be used as a landing so it will go up who 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.270
 will allow us to ride this circle each rotation 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.470
 so we're going to do a rotation and the fate of seven rotations is the case on 3ds 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.110
 employment placed at the level of this segment 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.370
 so uppercase because on the grid 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.940
 we select 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 our circle other segments that we can throw to the rescue 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.930
 we increase the number of sponsors 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 then we can increase the number of laps 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580
 Once we're done 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.430
 we just have to fly over 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.380
 vallini who served us as family 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 we press eggs and he x to erase it 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 but then we have our game 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.440
 so now we are going to see so little the same tool by tilting to a little bit 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 this segment 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.590
 for the moment on this short 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.940
 which sometimes it does not work well a bit stupid in fact of the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.220
 city ​​in which we are 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
 so we will switch to object mode 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 we will put ourselves in the right view 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 perkins to expectations all holy catherine the real 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.959
 so we will move 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.959
 this is our object rather to move the 3d cursor 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
 we go to mauricio and roland this scoop 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.139
 really interested in this absence 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.779
 and the number of laps 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:26.639
 so that's the inclination of our segment to determine angola 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.839
 here that our circle is going to take that the co is going to take 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.040
 in the same way overflight forced to delete with the mtx to erase it 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.799
 for now and then with turin circlefinance com we will make sure 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.109
 to create a spiral 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.889
 so here we have the landing of our spiral which is always finishing in this 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.499
 segment 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.529
 we select all that 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 then we launch the scoop 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.009
 but we have a mind of this absence 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.829
 the number of laps 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.829
 so that allows us to have a mother a spiral very easily 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.809
 so we always select calmly 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 if we removed had fixed 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.480
 go to finish we'll have a plan that shakes with just property sense 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.199
 so we will use our segment we will move a little bit 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 we will put a little time 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.449
 what to put our 3d cursor here 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.339
 and we will launch the sco 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.549
 far in this way we can see how the seco fund works 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.179
 means the secret life 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.239
 so we can create this kind of shape more easily
