00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.509
 good if you get to this video I want 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.570
 suppose that your jailbreak did not finish 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.790
 the right way maybe it marked you some 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.190
 mistake anything or maybe you 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.260
 the screen was left blank or 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.300
 you just see the logo of what it is 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.980
 app I want to mention you do not get 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.410
 worry all this first 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.779
 has a solution very easily is something 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.640
 that many people happen to you I'm going 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.130
 to show the way how are you going to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.140
 solve it I want to mention you before 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.999
 perform this process that I'm going to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.890
 do with an ipad but I want to 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.680
 mention that if this situation 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 it happened with an iphone phone the steps 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.380
 they will be exactly the same ok 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 then let's start what we 're going to 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.010
 to do is close the lifting program 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.140
 with what we did in the break already 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 then I want you to open the itunes 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.220
 Once you have opened on the iTunes 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.320
 I want to assume that you still have 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.630
 connected what is your ipad by means 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.910
 from the usb cable to your computer what's going 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.230
 to happen here that like the ipad it 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.360
 find with the black screen 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.800
 only with the apple logo 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.810
 here technically when you open the program 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.950
 he will not recognize you as usual 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.140
 he does it when 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 you connect what we have to do is 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.200
 enter the ipad in safe mode I'm going to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.630
 give instructions on how to make your 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.329
 ipad enter in safe mode so that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.399
 technically itunes recognize it and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.740
 we can return it to how it comes 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.149
 factory and subsequently return to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.090
 perform what is the jailbreak 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.890
 holding down the keys one of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.280
 they the home one that is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.130
 forward and the other the one above that is 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.560
 the one you usually use to sleep 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.539
 your ipad are going to keep the two 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.509
 suppressed at the same time by some 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.789
 seconds so that the ipad turns off 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.429
 completely immediately when it 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.399
 turn off you're going to release the button above 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.259
 that is to turn on and off without releasing what 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.989
 which is the one that is suppressing 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.959
 currently that is the home or the 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:02.360
 start that way you enter what 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.729
 is the safe mode now the screen of 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.679
 my ipad stayed let's say like dark 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.840
 but then that I made this 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.910
 process that I am telling you here I 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 says itunes that our ipad is 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.780
 find in mode 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.599
 to recover in a few words what are we going to 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.940
 restore we are going to say here that ok and 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.010
 on this side we are going to select 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.629
 restore our ipad at this moment 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.580
 is telling me to restore and 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.410
 update it may be that nothing else 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.450
 tell to restore let's say yes 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.360
 to continue technically with the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.370
 process we are going to give you next we are going to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.890
 accept what are the terms of the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.450
 service we give you that we accept and here 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.069
 our ipad starts to restore 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 technically it makes him a rich see and 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.269
 what is the operating system so that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.250
 is exactly as it came from the factory 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.370
 says it's going to take 10 minutes 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.500
 As soon as the process ends, see you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.230
 well, the 10 minutes have passed 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.989
 here technically the ipad is like 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.880
 starting again I do not know if you 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.650
 the camera quite see because 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.480
 is a little bit withdrawn and I also have 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.019
 reflection in what is the screen of the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.880
 iPad but you see a line that is being 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.340
 filling as the information 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.650
 technically after this is over 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.270
 your ipad will return to how it came 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.160
 Originally factory 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.740
 and unfortunately you are going to have to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.690
 perform the same jailbreak process 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.490
 so that finally you stay 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.040
 I want to mention you do not feel 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.650
 sad or angry really sometimes 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.870
 happens in these types of cases we do not have 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.120
 nothing we can do more though 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.620
 restore it to how it comes from the factory and 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.620
 other sure if you ever do 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.300
 after this again the jailbreak 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.310
 now it will work for you 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.560
 well here I put a message on 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.380
 screen that had already been said 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.170
 finished the restoration process 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.160
 here I reappear what is another 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.140
 kind of line that is filling 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.600
 let's wait for it to end so that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.460
 finally the process is finished 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.030
 or technically right now what he did 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.770
 itunes was let's say turn it off and turn it on 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.450
 to continue with the process and if you 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
 you realize it's already showing up here 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.850
 in what is itunes the program already I 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.470
 is recognizing and obviously when the 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.080
 process that is filling this 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.450
 line finish then technically 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.940
 I will be able to do again what 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.080
 is the process of jailbreak in this 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.720
 next 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.689
 is asking me to place what I 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.259
 is my information regarding an account 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.550
 of support that I already have currently 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.199
 this is done because every time you 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.210
 you go back to restore what the system is 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.520
 operative on your ipad was 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.229
 previously let's say linked to your 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.060
 account of what is 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.340
 app then here is asking you 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 again as to confirm this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.229
 information 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.229
 I'm going to put my information 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.500
 on this side if you did some 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.750
 backup earlier on this side you're going to 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.910
 be able to choose any of those backups 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.040
 that you have done previously you are going 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.540
 to give continue or if you can not give 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.000
 this option up here that 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.170
 technically it leaves you like new 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.730
 how it came the first day what 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.380
 you bought any of these two 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.170
 You can take options you are going to give 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.460
 continue and here is restarting what 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.260
 It's my ipad 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.270
 according to the backup that I already had 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.400
 previously saved let's wait 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.390
 good here after the last process 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.830
 that we saw the ipad is again 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.830
 restarting is coming back here turn on 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.240
 let's wait 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.220
 again he is putting me what is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.740
 another little line I do not know if you 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.960
 you can see through the camera 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.380
 with which I'm recording but this 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.240
 line now it's about the backup that I 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.430
 I had previously saved or the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.800
 backup of my information that 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.640
 I already had and let's say saved with 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.490
 anticipation 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.100
 here he's reinstalling it to what 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.020
 what is this ipad obviously if you 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.060
 You selected me to make a copy 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.620
 clean that you did not have any backup 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.710
 maybe at this moment I would have 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.960
 finalized in my case I'll wait 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.900
 I want to mention to you that usually when 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.760
 your your ipad you return them as it came from 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.840
 factory will always put the window 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.160
 of presentation at the beginning where you go to 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.600
 have to select some 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.820
 configurations that come by default 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.370
 The only thing I recommend is that you continue 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.889
 those steps so that finally your ipad 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.870
 it is absolutely normal as 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.150
 you've always had that that's what I'm going 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.280
 to do at this time and then look if 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.540
 you realize after following that 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.260
 display window as 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.669
 technically the ipad has already finished 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.830
 so here what I'm going to do is 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.660
 repeat the process again 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.600
 jailbreak in the same manner as 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.940
 we did at the beginning and obviously when 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.880
 you finish it believe me this second 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.830
 Once you do it technically already 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.440
 you will be left with the jailbreak and you 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.979
 I repeat this situation is only with 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.750
 certain people do not happen with all if 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.250
 this is your situation then good 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.080
 unfortunately you're going to have to 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.680
 do it again and technically the 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.750
 process has concluded 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.669
 then I say goodbye to you my name is 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.160
 omar castañeda let me your comment 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.380
 under the video and tell me if it happened to you 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.090
 also the same with respect to this and 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.090
 Well, see you in the next
