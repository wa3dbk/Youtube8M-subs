looks amazing
yet<00:04:54.470> again<00:04:54.650> only<00:04:55.610> what<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.820> first<00:04:56.060> one<00:04:56.390> I'm

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
yet again only what the first one I'm

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.690 
yet again only what the first one I'm
hoping<00:04:57.320> at<00:04:57.620> some<00:04:57.650> point<00:04:58.040> I'll<00:04:58.160> do<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> bind<00:04:58.550> up

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
hoping at some point I'll do a bind up

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.160 
hoping at some point I'll do a bind up
of<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:59.030> because<00:04:59.540> they<00:04:59.690> have<00:04:59.840> quite<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.080> few

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
of this because they have quite a few

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.980 
of this because they have quite a few
issues<00:05:00.950> out<00:05:01.370> already<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:02.390> I'm<00:05:02.510> hoping<00:05:02.810> that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
issues out already so I'm hoping that

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.870 
issues out already so I'm hoping that
they'll<00:05:03.170> do<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.100> but<00:05:04.370> again<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.820> don't

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
they'll do that but again I don't

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.490 
they'll do that but again I don't
