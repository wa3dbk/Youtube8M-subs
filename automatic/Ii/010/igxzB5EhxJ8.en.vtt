 Well, if we are in an area of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.330
 map of gt5 where the river is located 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 zancudo as you are seeing here we have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.619
 this tunnel where they happened about 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.869
 completely demonic events 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.640
 of lucy a girl who was raped and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 murdered on this same bridge that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.190
 we have here and this girl the spirit of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.700
 this girl wanders by this river then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 we will see a series of secrets or a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.800
 secret in particular that is going to leave you 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 goosebumps events 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 they happened in such a way 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.510
 lucy walked down this path for this 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.880
 path here and what happened is that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.630
 he got the notion of time and went to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 stop this one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.130
 that as you can see is very wrong 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 lit up here your captor got 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.539
 struggle with her but in the end 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.399
 he managed to rape her 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.650
 once violated it lucy was 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.190
 completely unconscious 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.130
 the captor to see that he did not respond and that 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.140
 she barely breathed, she thought she was dead 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.140
 so he decided to get rid of 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.410
 corpse throwing him into the zancudo river that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.800
 as we can see, it 's right by 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.440
 here 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.420
 álex want to continue if we go to 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.480
 continue with the story from that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.860
 moment when he threw the girl into the river 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.490
 Well, as we are seeing in this river, 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.980
 it's very deep then the body came out 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.380
 in the light it came out and could not see it at 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.150
 people and what happened is that is what 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.040
 next started or they threw it from the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.740
 bridge and came here as we are 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.880
 seeing form this river I do not think that if 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.340
 you look a little bit you can see a 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.479
 corpse without any problem 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.500
 Yes, besides 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.360
 but also how the 14 thought that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.280
 I was shot but I was not 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.769
 dead then what happened is that at 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 falling into the unconscious river ended up 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.440
 drown the current what he did 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.209
 it was simply dragging it towards the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 place that we read right there in front 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.750
 where we can see that tree that we have 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.730
 there you can focus it on that tree and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 the thing is important because I believe what 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.420
 let's think a little bit like the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.849
 'rapist I think I throw it here 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.700
 because this river seems to me that it flows 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.739
 it has a long way to go but 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.049
 flows into the sea as we are seeing 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.269
 on the map but because it did not work out 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.250
 and let's see now what he has told 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.769
 missing that there is a secret in this game 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.269
 that almost nobody has seen you have 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.950
 been able to see how good we are 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.440
 getting in here in the river so we're going to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.739
 see it when we got here that is by 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.870
 this area not if we have to imagine the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.579
 body of the girl 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.390
 how the current is carried by 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.790
 here the current is worth dragging 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.390
 and we're going to go to the place where 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.430
 find 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.310
 Well, we are already here in the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.360
 area where they found the corpse of the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.910
 girl right here was left by the river and 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.910
 the people found it was 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.720
 so disfigured by the action of water 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.300
 on the skin that they did not know how to recognize 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.660
 who was really treated then 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.370
 they decided to bury it and where the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.739
 they buried you want to show them you 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.410
 where is this hidden tomb in 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.420
 the map if someone was found and here 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.000
 is the grave we are going to visualize the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.580
 now we teach in the area where it is 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.500
 today we are here going up farga boy and 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.510
 here is the grave this one looks a little 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.620
 weird is like inside this 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.350
 stone and it's huge that's like a 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.690
 pantheon like those in the cemetery but 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.220
 here stuck in this in this rock we are 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.590
 seeing that it is a bit difficult to 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.600
 visualize is no longer that you pass by here 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.090
 The time is quite difficult to visualize 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.530
 and I think that's why it's so hidden 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.560
 because the saints did not want 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.450
 fame this event and here they hid it 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.970
 that is buried in this rock inside 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.900
 of this rock and it is impressive this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.780
 mystery is we have to add álex that 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.310
 the corpse of the girl was found because 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.100
 at the beginning everyone thought there was 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.919
 just disappeared what happens that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.770
 began to happen some events very 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.080
 paranormal in the whole walking area 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.480
 who came to visit the river simply 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.760
 they walked walking their dogs they said 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.330
 that late in the morning is 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.750
 I could hear the splashes of something in 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.230
 the water but they never could see 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.390
 the one that others said you could see the 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.520
 figure of a girl no one wondered 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.020
 what was it they all all wondered what 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.430
 it was what was happening what 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.770
 was happening and who could be that 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.900
 little girl until they managed to flirt with her 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.979
 that event of rape and 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.960
 murder when the police decided 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.690
 investigate the case of why he was 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.190
 happening these paranormal events 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.020
 that's when they found the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.699
 corpse and they could 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.740
 finally tie him to this murder of this 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.460
 disappearance until then only 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.169
 I thought that this girl had disappeared 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.060
 it appeared without more as we have seen before 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.550
 in the cave if you want or if you want 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.560
 let's see him a moment more and let's 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.840
 put c4 is for them to see what is 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.000
 inside is totally inside the rock 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.770
 and you can not do anything other than 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.259
 nothing because so it is to point it with the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.659
 light and I throw the c4 so yes now 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.819
 will be here is the pantheon as we are 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.430
 seeing inside that of the rock is 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.560
 huge and let's see I'm going to put the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.300
 maximum of four that are five and for 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.500
 the curious that many put us in 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.639
 the comments and why you have not 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.370
 put this so let's try 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.129
 us and so you see that nothing happens 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.129
 as we are seeing I am going to exploit it 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 and you see that nothing has happened is the 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.779
 rock and inside the grave and inside and not 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.029
 nothing happens neither the corpse nor the 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.039
 anything like a very rare thing 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.899
 before and if you have your theories 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.449
 you can put them in the comments 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:29.509
 because this tomb is truly rare 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:32.059
 our theory has been this in the grave 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.729
 has been buried here because the 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:37.129
 spirit is as enclosed within 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.519
 the mountain so he can not go out and 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:44.269
 because they basically tied it to 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:46.339
 this river is in memory since the girl of 

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:47.599
 where was his death is like when you see 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.789
 on the road when there is an accident 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.889
 and they put flowers in the place of a 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.169
 accident solution then in memory of 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.699
 this girl left this grave here as 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.550
 If it were your place 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.709
 as if it were his place yes very strange 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.809
 this mystery the truth if you want to come 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:05.749
 let's see him now put the 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:07.129
 is in the existence of the location 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.809
 which is right here next to a 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:11.449
 highway is the river as you see 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:13.489
 it flows into the sea a little far 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.860
 but good if I try to do this the 

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:16.790
 rapist and the one who killed her or came out 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.620
 pretty bad 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.230

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.530
