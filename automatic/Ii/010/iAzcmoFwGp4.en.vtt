00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.650
 Hi guys, how are you? I hope you 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.590
 everything is fine and you are not going to 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.570
 see they will only hear my voice 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.120
 because I'm going to teach you how to prepare 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.910
 a drink with very different inside than 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.270
 I have an event myself and I hope that 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.270
 you like 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.040
 good is a good that is alcoholic but it is a 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.910
 strong soft fall is a part one 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.250
 green dough vodka and she has a 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.090
 alcoholic fermentation much lower than 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.710
 the traditional logics and we put 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.930
 very little does it mean you put the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.879
 your own county criterion by placing a 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.340
 little is because something does no more 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.129
 well to no one 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.720
 I was doing that so she up 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.910
 frozen 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.270
 she is frozen, I'll leave it at 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:05.979
 freezer or a little above 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.950
 seeing a little bit of 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.680
 source 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.060
 there you put energy can be of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.509
 any brand this is what I most 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:23.590
 taste is what else to effect 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:27.759
 I'll put 66 rate of energy and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:32.170
 I'll put one can be a soda 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.060
 a relief in the case that I chose not 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.280
 can be a lemon soda can 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 be a natural lemon juice like you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.430
 I'll put it but I'll take care of it. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:53.980

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.690

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.690
