00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.039
 and then people who follow the channel do 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.990
 yourself 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.990
 we are here again with the wheel 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.369
 tornado and I'm going to bring a tip here 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.259
 that serves the vast majority of motorcycles 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.989
 When you have difficulty 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.610
 engage dead or neutral 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.430
 depending on the region the staff speaks 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.800
 nor another dead spot there was green light 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.230
 turns on and off I 'm moving the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.719
 pedal down here 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.620
 so what happens when the bike is 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.900
 hot 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.989
 she has difficulty in meshing the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.390
 you have to give that one 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 on the bike to power the point 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.809
 dead and enter with ease 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 so the problem is here 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.329
 Actually, the problem is here, you can. 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.290
 check your bike here is the pedal 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.219
 table but the problem is this 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.189
 here o 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:13.490
 you have a play on the pedal of the 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.249
 pedal the shaft the axes the ball here in the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:26.719
 and the pedal you see that I move in the 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:31.719
 pedal to carry pedal movement 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:37.219
 with eichmann it rotates around the axis 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:40.369
 I'm going to give you a camera, that 's it. 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.939
 move that little slack that causes 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.249
 an inaccuracy in the pedal operation 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.409
 of marches including the difficulty of 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.599
 put the bike in neutral 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.319
 so to solve this problem enough 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:59.060
 just tighten this screw here to power 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:01.279
 close the pedal against the shaft 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.439
 exchange makes the image exchange 

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:06.280
 So I'll press here and come back to 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.490
 show you 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 the result is seeing the pedal south 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:22.120
 mexico and lever the axis of the exchange of 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.920
 march is fixed here then to tighten 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.910
 only you use a 10 such key 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 here you are, oh boy, just like me 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.720
 I just said just press here and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.000
 ready 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.550
 now you can see what he lost 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.070
 that swing I had here on the pedal 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.230
 understood the movement here already 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:58.269
 is taking the shaft together with him now 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.550
 It's fixed as you can see, it's over. 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.819
 The movement that he is doing is slack. 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.430
 here it is already taking the axis 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.730
 along with it and now you will have more 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.799
 accuracy in gait changes in age 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.579
 from the dead end of the bike 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.190
 I already voted on this screw 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.829
 here a pressure alley to see if 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880
 he stopped loosening over time but 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.370
 did not help 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.170
 the engine vibration itself 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.360
 makes him loose over time 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.459
 So this tip I wanted to give 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.799
 You guys are smart 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.810
 when your motorcycle starts having 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.480
 difficulty Christmas neutral as 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.940
 Can you come and take a look here if the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.030
 pedal gear never loose there you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.650
 just squeeze that solves the problem 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.750
 So that's it , thanks for the tip. 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.660
 You who watch the channel there watch 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.880
 to the other videos we have here 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 on this bike I already did 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.920
 There are several videos you can find there. 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.530
 playlist with only the videos of the bike then 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.450
 I thank all those who are giving a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.579
 like a jewel in the bottom put in 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.880
 facebook promote your friends 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.880
 A hug and until our next video
