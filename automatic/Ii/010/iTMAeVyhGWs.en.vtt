that came out to with the brain in it it
looks<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.159> nice<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.659> wondering

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
looks really nice actually I'm wondering

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.100 
looks really nice actually I'm wondering
if<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> way<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:29.600> maybe<00:01:30.600> blow<00:01:30.930> out

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
if there's a way I can maybe blow out

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.830 
if there's a way I can maybe blow out
the<00:01:31.320> other<00:01:31.500> side<00:01:31.619> too<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.880> sleep<00:01:33.630> on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the other side too and then sleep on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.340 
the other side too and then sleep on
some<00:01:34.220> rollers<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.250> something<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 

I<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.770> take<00:01:40.979> advantage<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.760> blow-dry

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I can take advantage of the blow-dry

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.570 
I can take advantage of the blow-dry
since<00:01:42.570> i<00:01:42.750> rarely<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.400> really

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
since i rarely do it but I was really

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.450 
since i rarely do it but I was really
excited<00:01:44.909> about<00:01:45.150> doing<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> style<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.470> went

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
excited about doing the style so I went

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.749 
excited about doing the style so I went
ahead<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> blow<00:01:47.970> dried<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> anyway<00:01:48.780> below<00:01:49.759> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
ahead and blow dried it anyway below in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.050 
ahead and blow dried it anyway below in
the<00:01:51.119> back<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.890> mostly<00:01:53.190> braided<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.940> it's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the back it's mostly braided up so it's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
the back it's mostly braided up so it's
half<00:01:54.259> half<00:01:55.259> blown<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.100> half<00:01:58.549> half<00:01:59.549> just

consider myself a pretty good brighter
but<00:04:22.040> this<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.640> was<00:04:22.790> actually<00:04:22.970> challenging

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
but this one was actually challenging

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.900 
but this one was actually challenging
the<00:04:23.900> very<00:04:24.080> first<00:04:24.290> time<00:04:24.500> i<00:04:24.800> tempted<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.580> do<00:04:25.729> it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
the very first time i tempted to do it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.840 
the very first time i tempted to do it
i'm<00:04:26.390> going<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:27.070> cornrow<00:04:28.070> instead<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.729> a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
i'm going to do a cornrow instead of a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.270 
i'm going to do a cornrow instead of a
French<00:04:29.540> braid<00:04:29.750> at<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.410> French<00:04:30.740> braid<00:04:30.890> in<00:04:31.100> when<00:04:31.250> i

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
French braid at a French braid in when i

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.980 
French braid at a French braid in when i
started<00:04:31.640> with<00:04:31.790> you<00:04:31.910> guys<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.300> i<00:04:32.510> think<00:04:32.930> it

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
started with you guys but i think it

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.260 
started with you guys but i think it
actually<00:04:33.110> looks<00:04:33.470> better<00:04:33.530> with<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.270> cornrow

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
actually looks better with a cornrow

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.240 
actually looks better with a cornrow
just<00:04:35.960> because<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:37.360> soup<00:04:38.360> action<00:04:39.350> and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.159 

being<00:04:43.250> able<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.550> hide<00:04:43.760> my<00:04:44.169> hairline

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
being able to hide my hairline

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.820 
being able to hide my hairline
underneath<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:46.479> cornrow<00:04:47.479> work<00:04:47.690> better<00:04:47.960> it's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
underneath it cornrow work better it's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.330 
today and he was like what is this I
can't<00:06:33.500> tell<00:06:33.680> if<00:06:33.800> it's<00:06:33.890> a<00:06:34.040> hat<00:06:34.220> or<00:06:34.460> what<00:06:34.870> but<00:06:35.870> I

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
can't tell if it's a hat or what but I

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.670 
can't tell if it's a hat or what but I
think<00:06:37.340> it's<00:06:37.490> a<00:06:37.610> cute<00:06:37.850> style<00:06:39.010> see<00:06:41.320> and<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.500> could

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
think it's a cute style see and I could

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.440 
think it's a cute style see and I could
probably<00:06:42.890> just<00:06:43.250> hang<00:06:43.700> on<00:06:43.880> to<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.150> for<00:06:44.330> a<00:06:44.360> little

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
probably just hang on to it for a little

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.110 
probably just hang on to it for a little
while<00:06:44.660> but<00:06:45.100> my<00:06:46.100> co-workers<00:06:46.580> made<00:06:46.760> a<00:06:46.790> big<00:06:46.970> deal

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
while but my co-workers made a big deal

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.520 
while but my co-workers made a big deal
out<00:06:47.180> of<00:06:47.330> it<00:06:47.510> at<00:06:47.630> work<00:06:47.720> to<00:06:47.990> their<00:06:48.169> like<00:06:48.380> that

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
out of it at work to their like that

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.530 
out of it at work to their like that
looks<00:06:48.710> so<00:06:48.890> difficult<00:06:49.400> how<00:06:49.669> did<00:06:49.940> you<00:06:50.060> do<00:06:50.210> it<00:06:50.419> how

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
looks so difficult how did you do it how

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.760 
looks so difficult how did you do it how
long<00:06:50.720> did<00:06:50.900> it<00:06:50.960> take<00:06:51.050> so<00:06:51.229> I<00:06:51.740> think<00:06:52.520> the<00:06:53.500> Big<00:06:54.500> Bang

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
long did it take so I think the Big Bang

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.040 
long did it take so I think the Big Bang
factor<00:06:55.400> with<00:06:55.610> it<00:06:55.790> is<00:06:55.910> kind<00:06:56.180> of<00:06:56.300> over<00:06:56.690> I'd<00:06:56.870> like

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
factor with it is kind of over I'd like

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.020 
factor with it is kind of over I'd like
to<00:06:57.260> do<00:06:57.770> something<00:06:58.070> else<00:06:58.370> you<00:06:58.580> know<00:06:58.669> like<00:06:58.880> you

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
to do something else you know like you

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.640 
to do something else you know like you
