the first things we had to overcome on
the<00:01:15.520> machine<00:01:15.789> that<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.970> thought<00:01:16.270> was<00:01:16.420> pretty

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the machine that I thought was pretty

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.749 
the machine that I thought was pretty
impressive<00:01:16.990> these<00:01:17.710> machines<00:01:18.100> are<00:01:18.280> built<00:01:18.429> as<00:01:18.729> a

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
impressive these machines are built as a

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.749 
impressive these machines are built as a
touchscreen<00:01:19.450> with<00:01:20.320> Akuma's<00:01:20.800> health<00:01:21.070> we<00:01:21.640> were

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
touchscreen with Akuma's health we were

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.749 
touchscreen with Akuma's health we were
able<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.060> put<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.860> macro<00:01:23.860> program<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.580> will

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
able to put a macro program that will

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.059 
able to put a macro program that will
display<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.450> here<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.289> allow<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.500> keyboard

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
display up here and allow the keyboard

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.710 
display up here and allow the keyboard
to<00:01:27.190> be<00:01:27.310> able<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.550> do<00:01:27.729> what<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:28.030> need<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.270> do<00:01:28.450> and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
to be able to do what we need to do and

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.300

it's<00:01:44.530> going<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.680> be<00:01:44.740> around<00:01:45.009> for<00:01:45.310> 20<00:01:45.820> years<00:01:46.000> and

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
it's going to be around for 20 years and

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.830 
it's going to be around for 20 years and
it<00:01:46.719> has<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.049> capability<00:01:47.229> for<00:01:47.799> us<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.340> do<00:01:48.840> work

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
it has the capability for us to do work

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.109

we<00:01:50.049> didn't<00:01:50.290> think<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.530> could<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.890> three<00:01:51.880> years

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
we didn't think we could do three years

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.749 
we didn't think we could do three years
ago<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:53.170> accessibility<00:01:53.860> pieces<00:01:54.280> allowed<00:01:54.579> us

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
ago the accessibility pieces allowed us

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.209 
ago the accessibility pieces allowed us
to<00:01:54.789> level<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.329> playing<00:01:55.390> field<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.649> where<00:01:56.829> we
