that<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> good<00:03:00.370> application<00:03:01.299> for<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that was a good application for the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.679 
that was a good application for the
beginner<00:03:02.260> or<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.340> veteran<00:03:03.579> hunter<00:03:04.150> trying<00:03:04.450> to

beginner or the veteran hunter trying to

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.000 
beginner or the veteran hunter trying to
just<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.859> know<00:03:05.980> learn<00:03:06.280> some<00:03:06.579> new<00:03:06.609> things<00:03:07.090> also

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
just you know learn some new things also

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.890 
just you know learn some new things also
so<00:03:09.010> get<00:03:09.280> getting<00:03:09.579> back<00:03:09.879> to<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.510> turkey

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
was one of the first applications I

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.849 
was one of the first applications I
found<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.489> iPhone<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.019> thought<00:03:29.440> was<00:03:29.829> a

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
found on the iPhone that I thought was a

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.939 
found on the iPhone that I thought was a
very<00:03:30.129> good<00:03:30.639> application<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.260> simply<00:03:32.739> just

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
very good application and it simply just

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.819 
very good application and it simply just
broken<00:03:33.430> down<00:03:33.459> into<00:03:33.940> different<00:03:34.569> types<00:03:35.500> of

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
broken down into different types of

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:43.050 
broken down into different types of
calls<00:03:36.159> and<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:38.879> plays<00:03:39.879> for<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.870> duration<00:03:42.060> until

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
calls and it plays for a duration until

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.270 
calls and it plays for a duration until
you<00:03:43.239> stop<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.900> isn't<00:03:44.260> let's<00:03:44.470> pick<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.859> turkey

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
you stop it isn't let's pick the turkey

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:58.289 
you stop it isn't let's pick the turkey
hand<00:03:45.870> push<00:03:46.870> play<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.150> will

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
hand push play you can see that it will

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.839 
hand push play you can see that it will
continue<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:59.079> play<00:03:59.290> until<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.280> until<00:04:00.699> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
continue to play until the until you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.360 
continue to play until the until you
stop<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:01.659> thought<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.530> was<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> good<00:04:03.129> thing

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
stop it I thought that was a good thing

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.309 
stop it I thought that was a good thing
they<00:04:03.609> did<00:04:03.849> instead<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.389> just<00:04:04.569> putting<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.049> five

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
they did instead of just putting a five

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.250 
they did instead of just putting a five
six<00:04:05.859> seven<00:04:06.280> second<00:04:07.919> calling<00:04:08.919> and<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.430> stopped

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
six seven second calling and it stopped

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.390 
six seven second calling and it stopped
okay<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.040> let's<00:04:12.220> go<00:04:12.400> back<00:04:13.889> unfortunately<00:04:14.889> when

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
okay so let's go back unfortunately when

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.189 
okay so let's go back unfortunately when
we<00:04:15.430> come<00:04:15.699> back<00:04:15.879> out<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.150> each<00:04:16.359> application<00:04:17.079> we

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
we come back out of each application we

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.289 
we come back out of each application we
have<00:04:17.409> to<00:04:17.530> go<00:04:17.650> back<00:04:17.829> into<00:04:18.070> my<00:04:18.310> folder<00:04:18.579> each<00:04:18.970> time

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
have to go back into my folder each time

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.030 
have to go back into my folder each time
when<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.599> does

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
when that does

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.380 
when that does
a<00:04:20.100> little<00:04:20.460> extra<00:04:20.760> time<00:04:20.970> for<00:04:21.240> it<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.360> load<00:04:21.600> up

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
a little extra time for it to load up

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.280 
a little extra time for it to load up
the<00:04:24.390> next<00:04:24.780> woman<00:04:25.110> was<00:04:25.740> by<00:04:26.310> bike<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:27.290> solution

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
the next woman was by bike a solution

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.110 
the next woman was by bike a solution

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
one right here and again it's broken

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.150

gobble keke panic they're all in here

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:05.350 
gobble keke panic they're all in here
and<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.980> know<00:04:56.100> they<00:04:56.720> they<00:04:57.720> sound<00:04:58.020> fairly<00:04:58.320> good

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.840 

and<00:05:06.360> again<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.740> push<00:05:08.070> stop<00:05:08.400> on<00:05:08.700> this

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
and again you have to push stop on this

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.370 
and again you have to push stop on this
and<00:05:09.120> -<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.510> that's<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.840> good<00:05:09.990> another<00:05:10.140> good

and - so that's a good another good

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.920 
and - so that's a good another good
feature<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.160> about<00:05:11.400> these<00:05:11.790> they<00:05:12.090> continue

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
feature I like about these they continue

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:28.640 
feature I like about these they continue
to<00:05:12.960> play<00:05:13.820> until<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.090> want<00:05:15.300> them<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.570> stop<00:05:27.650> and

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
to play until you want them to stop and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.070 
to play until you want them to stop and
it<00:05:28.800> causes<00:05:29.070> -<00:05:29.490> mixture<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.360> play<00:05:30.780> several
