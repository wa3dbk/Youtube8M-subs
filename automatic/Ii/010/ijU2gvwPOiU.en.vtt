00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.270
 hello I love doing the favorite 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.430
 acatech and you want to know where i am good 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.550
 and gladly fail then stay tuned 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.110
 First we come to the topic of mascara 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.029
 mascara can apply this beautiful good 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.579
 I but I have every day if you 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.919
 really mascara spots every day 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.630
 here on the upper eyelid it is annoying 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.509
 when you make up like totally beautiful eyes 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.880
 has made make-up and then the upper lid 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.430
 in constant any patches it has 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.260
 annoying then I would have such as well 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.700
 Eye Makeup Correction Pen by B2's 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.910
 is really good but with time 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.010
 also black at the top and then 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.910
 you miss his make-up even more 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.250
 And every day I get the full crisis 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.350
 about it and I get it somehow 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.429
 not the office to do anything about that 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.410
 it does not happen 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.089
 then we come to a topic what 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.829
 I believe everyone here so far about the 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.589
 day exactly 21 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.909
 So what is liquid alone? 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.989
 that's not the thing at all 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.760
 I can because then I can do it too 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.290
 winn pull that is no topic at all 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.360
 but come on no I like it every time 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.009
 me somehow a nice ring 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.290
 that is always there so that there 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.450
 such a beam hangs behind it and it 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.829
 looks just always grottig I have 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 already try all sorts of things alone 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.600
 I tried all sorts of brushes 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.659
 I just do not think so 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.890
 talented then next in things 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.479
 to not make up so much with 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.329
 rather do with my hair 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.250
 I just can not handle myself with one 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.280
 curls straighteners to make 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.039
 it did not exist so I'm just there 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.060
 completely unknown just as envious 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.860
 and I keep watching them 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 tutorials to all that always so completely 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.969
 easily easy starting with these 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 rally with how videos with the curling iron 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.990
 lure with the flat iron 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.460
 I would be so jealous I would 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 I also like it so much 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.430
 simply not 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.229
 I will always be the nice variant 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.240
 for my hair because I can not stop 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.450
 keep an eye out and if you want to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.610
 a gentler one was 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.579
 lure to make even a video have 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 wanna let me know when that 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.649
 next topic i express myself for fake 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.099
 Lashes wrong if you stick on 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.500
 I can do it now but it is like that 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.030
 a tiresome topic somehow it is like that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.519
 a frequency work and then you hang 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.230
 all the time and it takes me too 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.690
 lasts forever and so i do so 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
 but it can let it out 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.060
 laziness away and still too sandy 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.030
 exit well and like to lie left 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.739
 Let's paint nails once I have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.660
 now here again splintered 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.200
 the fingernail so the lay the name 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.450
 has played Merkel thinks her I 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.930
 come today still on the idea the nails 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.299
 to paint and 19 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.920
 I'm just too lazy someday 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.260
 my nails always look like they do 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.599
 hempel under the sofa and then you have to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.090
 paint new but I'm just like that 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.560
 so lazy what that concerns 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.420
 I am a little ashamed of myself 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.230
 wish it was me differently, I must 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.100
 maybe a little bit 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.760
 discipline 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.109
 but well, everyone has his quirks then 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.010
 as next and last point 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.079
 pluck eyebrows 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.970
 I am somehow up there as well 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.950
 on the one hand, that's great for me 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.620
 not always at the smallest rule 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.250
 already do that I am after then 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.230
 I'm too lazy 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.450
 in the end people with the streaking days 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.030
 then looks like starting from scratch again 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.410
 and somehow bring in structure 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.760
 actually I would have to have such a time 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 make sure that I'm in the summer 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 benefit browser or something like that is me 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.959
 that just maybe somehow 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.030
 enjoy or look good as a wellness 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.680
 for me that I could just do it 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.900
 continuous machinists like that 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.889
 pig dog 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.209
 that was it for the first time with the 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.459
 things that occurred to me right away 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.889
 where I like to pack well 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.150
 or where I'm just too lazy and 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.590
 if the statement of his team the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.440
 I am absolutely in the comments I am 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.919
 totally curious to read it 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.569

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.669

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.220
