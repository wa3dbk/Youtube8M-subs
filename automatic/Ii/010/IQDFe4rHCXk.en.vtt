many<00:01:52.590> hours<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> push<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.810> down

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
many hours and if you push up or down

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
many hours and if you push up or down
when<00:01:55.079> nothing<00:01:55.320> else<00:01:55.409> active<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.219> change

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
when nothing else active it will change

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.280 
when nothing else active it will change
the<00:01:56.759> temperature<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:57.719> set<00:01:57.960> to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.430 

the<00:02:03.100> louvers<00:02:03.430> on<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> front<00:02:03.940> are<00:02:04.410> okay<00:02:05.410> I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
the louvers on the front are okay I

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.060 
the louvers on the front are okay I
guess<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.080> control<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.650> air<00:02:08.770> flow

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
guess you can control the air flow

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.810 
guess you can control the air flow
side-to-side<00:02:10.710> but<00:02:11.710> because<00:02:12.100> inside<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.550> this

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
side-to-side but because inside of this

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.140 
side-to-side but because inside of this
there<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.650> cage<00:02:14.650> tight<00:02:15.040> fan<00:02:15.400> most<00:02:15.880> they<00:02:16.120> are

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
there is a cage tight fan most they are

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.090 
there is a cage tight fan most they are
kind<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.750> comes<00:02:17.110> out<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.410> an<00:02:17.560> angle<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.040> that

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
kind of comes out in an angle like that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.790 
kind of comes out in an angle like that
so<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.090> use<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.420> inner<00:02:19.630> louvers<00:02:20.500> and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
so I have to use the inner louvers and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.440 
so I have to use the inner louvers and
point<00:02:21.160> them<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.490> other<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> make<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.270> come

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
point them the other way to make it come

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390 
point them the other way to make it come
straight<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.800> these<00:02:24.100> ones

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
straight out of this and then these ones

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.970 
straight out of this and then these ones
they<00:02:24.820> don't<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:26.320> pretty<00:02:26.470> hard<00:02:26.800> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
they don't really it's pretty hard to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
they don't really it's pretty hard to
get<00:02:27.070> them<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.520> point<00:02:28.390> up<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.660> down<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> guess

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
get them to a point up or down I guess

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.250 
get them to a point up or down I guess
the<00:02:29.470> point<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:31.300> once<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.960> leave<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the point is you just once and leave it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.030 
the point is you just once and leave it
there<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.710> here<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.850> 7000<00:02:34.720> BTU<00:02:35.050> 820<00:02:35.830> watts

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
there so here we have 7000 BTU 820 watts

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.230 
there so here we have 7000 BTU 820 watts
and<00:02:36.390> eer<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.720> 8.5<00:02:38.460> yeah<00:02:39.460> that's<00:02:39.790> actually<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
and eer of 8.5 yeah that's actually a

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.460 
and eer of 8.5 yeah that's actually a
pretty<00:02:40.690> bad<00:02:41.230> EER<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.760> considering<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:44.230> is

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
pretty bad EER but considering this is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.230 
pretty bad EER but considering this is
an<00:02:44.830> air<00:02:45.040> conditioner<00:02:45.460> I'm<00:02:45.760> only<00:02:45.940> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.150> be

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
an air conditioner I'm only going to be

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.050 
an air conditioner I'm only going to be
using<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.170> extremely<00:02:47.680> hot<00:02:47.890> days<00:02:48.130> in

considering the price at purchase for
you<00:02:50.740> can't<00:02:50.920> really<00:02:51.100> complain<00:02:51.870> seven<00:02:52.870> point

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
you can't really complain seven point

it doesn't get horribly humid so that'll

the<00:04:00.790> actual<00:04:01.300> air<00:04:01.840> conditioner<00:04:02.410> turn<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.220> on

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.900 

so<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.260> fan<00:04:14.500> starts<00:04:14.920> at<00:04:15.040> hive<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.670> turned

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
so the fan starts at hive and I turned

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.360 
so the fan starts at hive and I turned
it<00:04:16.030> back<00:04:16.120> down<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.510> low<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.019> let's<00:04:17.980> trigger

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
it back down to low and let's trigger

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:31.120 
it back down to low and let's trigger
the<00:04:18.760> compressor<00:04:19.510> here

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.250 

so<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.700> don't<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.150> if<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.390> can<00:04:32.570> determine<00:04:32.870> how

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
so I don't know if you can determine how

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.180 
so I don't know if you can determine how
loud<00:04:34.190> or<00:04:34.610> quiet<00:04:34.640> it<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.420> from<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:35.990> video<00:04:36.290> I'm

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
loud or quiet it is from this video I'm

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.670 
loud or quiet it is from this video I'm
still<00:04:37.490> talking<00:04:37.700> at<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.000> normal<00:04:38.360> voice<00:04:39.850> it's<00:04:40.850> not

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
still talking at a normal voice it's not

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.620 
still talking at a normal voice it's not
the<00:04:42.680> quietest<00:04:43.220> thing<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.580> world<00:04:43.700> it's

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
the quietest thing in the world it's

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.100 
the quietest thing in the world it's
nice<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.770> have<00:04:45.950> noise<00:04:46.940> instead<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.900> the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
nice to have noise instead of the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.050 
nice to have noise instead of the
90-degree<00:04:48.770> room

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.060 

and<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.750> starts<00:04:55.110> kicking<00:04:55.320> out<00:04:55.590> cold<00:04:55.920> air

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and it starts kicking out cold air

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.180 
and it starts kicking out cold air
almost<00:04:56.870> instantly<00:04:57.870> although<00:04:58.440> since<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:59.070> is

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
almost instantly although since it is

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.860 
almost instantly although since it is
only<00:04:59.310> seven<00:04:59.670> degrees<00:04:59.940> outside<00:05:00.390> it<00:05:00.690> doesn't

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
only seven degrees outside it doesn't

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.330 
only seven degrees outside it doesn't
have<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.200> work<00:05:01.320> too<00:05:01.500> hard<00:05:01.650> today<00:05:03.920> it<00:05:04.920> does<00:05:05.160> have

those annoying beep sounds every time

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.010
