00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360 
lunging his sources Zoey we've had quite
a<00:00:06.180> few<00:00:06.450> questions<00:00:06.839> have<00:00:07.649> come<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
a few questions have come in on the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.430 
a few questions have come in on the
internet<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:09.210> us<00:00:09.300> about<00:00:09.630> lunging<00:00:10.200> people

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
internet for us about lunging people

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.990 
internet for us about lunging people
wanting<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> start<00:00:11.010> their<00:00:11.190> horses<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
wanting to start their horses so I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.220 
wanting to start their horses so I
thought<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.360> would<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.690> good<00:00:12.929> opportunity

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
thought this would be a good opportunity

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.650 
thought this would be a good opportunity
since<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.130> watch<00:00:14.370> someone<00:00:14.759> Dave<00:00:15.240> here

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
since you can watch someone Dave here

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660 
since you can watch someone Dave here
who's<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.320> quite<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.430> am

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
who's not quite as good at that as I am

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.099 
who's not quite as good at that as I am
who<00:00:17.789> might<00:00:18.000> make<00:00:18.029> some<00:00:18.359> mistakes<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.960> can

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
who might make some mistakes and we can

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.150 
who might make some mistakes and we can
talk<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.590> he's<00:00:19.680> doing<00:00:19.890> right<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
what is doing wrong so as I said in our

what is doing wrong so as I said in our
my<00:00:23.010> blog<00:00:23.310> before<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.199> answers

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
my blog before or in some of my answers

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
my blog before or in some of my answers
to<00:00:25.769> some<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.970> most<00:00:27.119> important<00:00:27.630> thing

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to some of you the most important thing

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.269 
to some of you the most important thing
that<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> establish<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:29.130> you're

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that you have to establish when you're

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.769 
that you have to establish when you're
lunging<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> horse<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.269> thing<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> have

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
lunging a horse the first thing you have

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
lunging a horse the first thing you have
to<00:00:30.840> establish<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.830> horse<00:00:32.009> will<00:00:32.219> simply

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to establish is the horse will simply

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.610 
to establish is the horse will simply
stay<00:00:32.850> out<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> end<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> line<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
stay out at the end of the line so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
stay out at the end of the line so
before<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.219> worry<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:35.640> whether<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> horse

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
before you worry about whether the horse

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
before you worry about whether the horse
is<00:00:36.660> trotting<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:37.530> walk<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.219> whoa

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
is trotting or will walk or whoa

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
is trotting or will walk or whoa
especially<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.960> said<00:00:40.140> most<00:00:40.290> people<00:00:40.590> worry

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
especially as I said most people worry

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
especially as I said most people worry
about<00:00:40.829> whoa<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> need<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> worry<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.000> go

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
about whoa you need to worry about go

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
about whoa you need to worry about go
meaning<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.350> horse<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> end

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
meaning the horse will go out to the end

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.690 
meaning the horse will go out to the end
of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> line<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> whip<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.070> your<00:00:47.070> leg

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
of the line so the whip is your leg

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
of the line so the whip is your leg
essentially<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> you're<00:00:48.780> basically<00:00:49.050> moving

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
essentially and you're basically moving

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
essentially and you're basically moving
the<00:00:49.649> horse<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.520> hand<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.120> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the horse into your hand which is your

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
the horse into your hand which is your
rein<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.710> done<00:00:52.890> correctly<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
rein and if that's done correctly the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
rein and if that's done correctly the
horse<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.879> move<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> stay<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.629> there

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
horse will move out and stay out there

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.680 
horse will move out and stay out there
and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> most<00:00:56.100> important<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and then the most important thing the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
and then the most important thing the
next<00:00:57.840> important<00:00:58.289> thing<00:00:58.320> once<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> keep

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
next important thing once you can keep

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
next important thing once you can keep
them<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> begin<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
them out there then you can begin to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
them out there then you can begin to
worry<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.469> gait<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.770> horses<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
worry about what gait the horses in and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
worry about what gait the horses in and
and<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> quality<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> gate<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and the quality of that gate but the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
and the quality of that gate but the
first<00:01:05.250> thing<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> happen<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> said

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
first thing that has to happen as I said

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
first thing that has to happen as I said
as<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> horse<00:01:07.290> simply<00:01:07.590> has<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> stay<00:01:08.100> out

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
as the horse simply has to stay out

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
as the horse simply has to stay out
there<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.330> Dave<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there now can you see how is Dave now is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.719 
there now can you see how is Dave now is
let<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> horse<00:01:10.680> become<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.130> too<00:01:11.340> slow

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
let the horse become a little too slow

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
let the horse become a little too slow
so<00:01:12.030> he<00:01:12.510> needs<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> keep<00:01:12.960> his<00:01:13.020> whip<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> send

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so he needs to keep his whip up and send

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.039 
so he needs to keep his whip up and send
her<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.220> forward<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.030> she'll<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
her on forward so she'll go out into the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.740 
her on forward so she'll go out into the
reins<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.630> has

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
reins a little more like that so he has

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
reins a little more like that so he has
to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.350> active<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.890> notice

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to be a little more active now notice

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.550 
to be a little more active now notice
that<00:01:20.340> he's<00:01:20.700> always<00:01:20.880> walking<00:01:21.360> forward<00:01:22.350> with

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that he's always walking forward with

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
that he's always walking forward with
the<00:01:22.710> horse<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.490> he's<00:01:23.759> never<00:01:24.000> backing<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the horse so he's never backing up and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.359 
the horse so he's never backing up and
that<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> problem<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.340> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

with the bridle and but if it stretches
down<00:04:38.490> also<00:04:38.970> there's<00:04:39.150> something<00:04:39.480> there<00:04:39.780> for<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
down also there's something there for it

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.900 
down also there's something there for it

to stretch down into and accept that

to stretch down into and accept that
contact<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.500> correct<00:04:43.920> length<00:04:44.430> of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.340 
to lunge in this kind of length of rain
the<00:04:57.030> idea<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.570> lunging<00:04:57.900> getting<00:04:58.110> them<00:04:58.260> to

stretching<00:05:00.600> into<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.230> contact<00:05:01.800> instead<00:05:02.370> of

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
stretching into the contact instead of

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640 
stretching into the contact instead of
