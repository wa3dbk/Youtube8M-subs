00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700 

a<00:00:00.120> way<00:00:00.630> of<00:00:01.790> creating<00:00:02.790> or<00:00:03.030> generating<00:00:03.710> texture

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
a way of creating or generating texture

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.240 
a way of creating or generating texture
is<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.850> do<00:00:06.480> rubbings<00:00:06.990> or<00:00:07.290> as<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> French<00:00:07.950> call<00:00:08.220> it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
is to do rubbings or as a French call it

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.360 
is to do rubbings or as a French call it
frottage<00:00:09.080> it's<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.200> fancy<00:00:10.620> term<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
frottage it's a fancy term but what it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249 
frottage it's a fancy term but what it
basically<00:00:11.580> means<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.719> go<00:00:12.900> around

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
basically means is that you go around

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.259 
basically means is that you go around
everywhere<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:14.280> house<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> garden<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
everywhere your house the garden and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.210 
everywhere your house the garden and
everywhere<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.809> try<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> find<00:00:16.350> objects<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
everywhere and try to find objects that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.960 
everywhere and try to find objects that
have<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.920> irregular<00:00:19.920> surface<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.609> them<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have a irregular surface to them and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
have a irregular surface to them and
take<00:00:21.330> them<00:00:21.539> back<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.439> work

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
take them back and see how they work

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.670 
take them back and see how they work
when<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.949> rub<00:00:23.130> over<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.840> this<00:00:24.840> works<00:00:25.230> best

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
when you rub over them this works best

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.240 
when you rub over them this works best
you<00:00:26.180> need<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.449> paper<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> hard<00:00:28.740> support

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you need your paper on a hard support

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
you need your paper on a hard support
you<00:00:29.340> can't<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.630> lap<00:00:30.840> with

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you can't do this like on your lap with

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.530 
you can't do this like on your lap with
a<00:00:31.170> piece<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> paper<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.759> won't<00:00:33.180> work<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
a piece of paper and it won't work it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
a piece of paper and it won't work it
needs<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.899> hard<00:00:34.350> surface<00:00:34.590> beneath<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.550> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
needs a hard surface beneath it one that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 
needs a hard surface beneath it one that
won't<00:00:35.910> move<00:00:36.329> anywhere<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.980> works<00:00:38.219> best

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
won't move anywhere and it works best

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.530 
won't move anywhere and it works best
with<00:00:38.969> graphite<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> pencil<00:00:41.280> or

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
with graphite that is with a pencil or

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
with graphite that is with a pencil or
graphite<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.750> sold<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> stick<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
graphite is sold in a stick this is a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090 
graphite is sold in a stick this is a
graphite<00:00:44.789> stick<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> does<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.649> see

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
graphite stick and what it does you see

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
graphite stick and what it does you see
is<00:00:47.190> instead<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.789> having<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> point

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
is instead of having the just the point

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
is instead of having the just the point
of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> pencil<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.700> whole<00:00:50.910> side

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
of the pencil you have the whole side

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
of the pencil you have the whole side
and<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.230> need<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.860> these<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and what you need to do with these is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
and what you need to do with these is
actually<00:00:53.820> work<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.590> don't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually work it out so that you don't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
actually work it out so that you don't
end<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
end up with it you don't want these the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
end up with it you don't want these the
sharp<00:00:58.920> edges<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.730> get<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.449> way<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.660> you're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
sharp edges to get in your way so you're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.380 
sharp edges to get in your way so you're
going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> work<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.219> edge<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
going to have to work out the edge of it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to have to work out the edge of it
and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> come<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and then you come back and you have to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.980 
and then you come back and you have to
press<00:01:06.180> fairly<00:01:06.659> hard<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
press fairly hard but you can see that I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
press fairly hard but you can see that I
am<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> develop<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:15.020> texture<00:01:16.759> I'll<00:01:17.759> show

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
am going to develop a texture I'll show

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
am going to develop a texture I'll show
you<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:19.080> sometimes<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.189> with

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you you can sometimes do this with

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.749 
you you can sometimes do this with
charcoal<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> press<00:01:22.979> fairly<00:01:23.490> hard

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
charcoal you have to press fairly hard

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.050 
charcoal you have to press fairly hard
and<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.409> small<00:01:26.040> pattern<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and this is a very small pattern so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.609 
and this is a very small pattern so
you're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> basically<00:01:28.200> lose<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you're going to basically lose the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
you're going to basically lose the
pattern<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.549> sort<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.110> large

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
pattern in in sort of the the large

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
pattern in in sort of the the large
large<00:01:32.759> size<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> charcoal<00:01:33.900> particles<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
large size of the charcoal particles so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
large size of the charcoal particles so
graphite<00:01:35.400> sticks<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.360> worth<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
graphite sticks pretty much worth the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.179 
graphite sticks pretty much worth the
best<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.400> try<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> lot<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> things<00:01:39.689> um

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
best and we can try a lot of things um

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
best and we can try a lot of things um
lace<00:01:41.189> doilies<00:01:41.850> work<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.020> bottom<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> your

shoe works you can do coins if you want
to<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:47.520> making<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.090> pattern<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> coins

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to start making a pattern with the coins

to start making a pattern with the coins
on<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.130> purse<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
on your purse you can do that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
on your purse you can do that
but<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.439> basic<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.909> can

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but that's the basic you know you can

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.980 
but that's the basic you know you can
make<00:01:54.590> texture<00:01:55.590> yourself<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> in

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
make texture yourself and then use it in

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.979 
make texture yourself and then use it in
your<00:01:58.170> design
