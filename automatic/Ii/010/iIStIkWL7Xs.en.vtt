00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to be a smooth puree just enough that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
to be a smooth puree just enough that
you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.780> mix<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> rest<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> the

you can mix them in with the rest of the
batter<00:01:38.130> ingredient<00:01:39.170> next<00:01:40.170> we're<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
batter ingredient next we're going to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
batter ingredient next we're going to
beat<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> butter<00:01:41.430> until<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.600> soft

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
beat the butter until it's really soft

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
beat the butter until it's really soft
you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.530> warm<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> bowl<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.670> butters<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you can warm the bowl if your butters a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670 
you can warm the bowl if your butters a
little<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.479> hard<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> hot

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
little bit hard just a little bit of hot

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.660 
little bit hard just a little bit of hot
water<00:01:46.829> points<00:01:47.399> down

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.389 

that's<00:01:57.670> perfect<00:01:58.509> add<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.079> sugar<00:01:59.280> at<00:02:00.280> this

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
that's perfect add the sugar at this

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.740 
that's perfect add the sugar at this
point<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.759> think<00:02:00.820> it's<00:02:01.090> really<00:02:01.270> useful<00:02:01.360> just<00:02:01.630> a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
point I think it's really useful just a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.569 
point I think it's really useful just a
scrape<00:02:01.960> down<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.170> side<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.469> the<00:02:02.649> volte<00:02:03.070> can

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
scrape down the side to the volte can

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.120 
scrape down the side to the volte can
combine<00:02:03.970> everything<00:02:06.869> together<00:02:07.869> for<00:02:08.380> about<00:02:08.500> 30

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
combine everything together for about 30

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.500 
combine everything together for about 30
seconds

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.900 

and<00:02:13.660> once<00:02:14.440> it's<00:02:14.709> well<00:02:14.890> combined<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.700> can

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and once it's well combined then you can

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.600 
and once it's well combined then you can
add<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.300> egg<00:02:16.450> beat<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.319> before<00:02:17.440> adding<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.489> to
