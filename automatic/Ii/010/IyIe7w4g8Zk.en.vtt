00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 or not 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.540
 [Music] 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.800
 or they arrived before 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.800
 [Music] 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.710
 the Italian that you are I hope you will 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.570
 find wonder 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.310
 I am the one that today they are going to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.500
 teach I come to show you how to prepare 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.570
 a very rich very succulent snow that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 I assure you that you will love it without 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.720
 need of some machine not much 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.489
 less we're just going to occupy two 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.830
 ingredients plus the extra ingredient 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.570
 that this is going to be the flavor that I had 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.220
 loved that I had is to wish so 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.840
 once you raised him to give him can he served 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.150
 very good for our direction snow 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.879
 We're going to need two cups of cream 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.410
 to beat placed in a mold this 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.140
 mold has to be sufficiently 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.140
 big to be able to stir later 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 well as soon as I have space in my mold 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 to be able to stir the things that you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.689
 stay more or less the same 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.390
 well we're going to need milk too 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.130
 condensed one can approximately the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 we will let spill everything on our 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.690
 mixture 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 [Music] 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.920
 as I am doing it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.719
 very well in this step is optional you can 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 add a teaspoon of syrup 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.150
 Vanilla but it's only if you want this 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 It will give you a better taste 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.409
 [Music] 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.140
 very good and finally we are going to mix 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.750
 or to stir all our ingredients 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.149
 very very well until we have one 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.790
 mix as it is with a consistency not 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.800
 so thick and not so light 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.900
 we have our mixture around 3 to 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.880
 4 hours to the freezer and ready we have 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.320
 list our snow only that I 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 I'm going to teach you how to make different flavors 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.510
 to vary it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.220
 I'm going to teach you how to do the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.050
 flavor cookies and green for this we go 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 to occupy a package of cookies type 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.250
 oreo placed in a mold these 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.040
 We are going to crush cookies with a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.210
 glass this does not have to be 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.820
 completely in powder only with that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.920
 some pieces remain even if they are 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.920
 large chunks does not matter if like this one 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 We are going to place 3 large spoons 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.400
 of our mix and after this you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's stir everything until we do not 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.710
 is any kind of crumb or powder is 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.750
 the mixture take the freezer 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.460
 around 13 to 4 hours and ready 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.940
 we have our cookies snow list 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.380
 and cream 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.660
 do not forget to cover it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.090
 the next flavor is going to be one of milk 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.520
 so we put the snow mixture 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.800
 all that we want 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.070
 [Music] 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.310
 in this case I put 2 tablespoons 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.910
 let's put our burnt milk in 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.910
 circles 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.640
 The more milk you put, the more 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.640
 sweet will be 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.780
 let's stir it slowly and with 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.790
 very careful 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.280
 so that only one line remains 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.590
 but completely coffee we will add more 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.890
 snow 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.319
 and again more milk so we will go 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.510
 going up to the amount that you want to 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.510
 this taste of snow is very delicious 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.100
 and ready go to the freezer 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.940
 the next flavor is nutella flavor 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.160
 so I only add one 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.160
 scoop and a tablespoon of nutella 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.670
 but you can add the whole amount 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.070
 what do you want for the amount of snow 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.850
 What do you want, that is, I recommend that you 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.380
 do with the blender because it will be very 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.060
 difficult to do with the spoon since it is 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.980
 very thick until you have more or 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.240
 less of this color if you want it 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.760
 you can continue to add snow and 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.610
 again nutella but with me that's how it is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.130
 well we will take it to a mold we will cover 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
 and to the freezer also from 3 to 4 hours 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.150
 the next taste of the ultra 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.460
 I recommend it 's strawberry flavor so 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.070
 let's put a cup of strawberries in the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.980
 blender too what will you put a 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.170
 large spoonful of sugar or an envelope of 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.870
 sugar substitute and you'll start to 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.760
 stir it up little by little we do not need 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.769
 that we have no liquid left so if 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.350
 if you try you can shake it a bit like 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.180
 me but I recommend you not to be any 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.150
 liquid that is somewhat thick or 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.370
 a very good pieces of stub 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.290
 We will take our mixture to a mold 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.169
 we will add our snow again 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.009
 about 3 tablespoons three 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.749
 scoops per cup of snow 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.639
 so make sure you get the 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.349
 enough snow will start until 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.909
 stir it slowly until it fits 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.330
 a consistency more or less similar to 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.159
 is placed in a mold this mold is not 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.830
 is for itself to the freezer again and 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.240
 ready we have our snow ready and 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.240
 now we are going to prove that there is the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.250
