never have my leaves rustling in the
wind<00:01:15.869> again<00:01:16.320> i've<00:01:16.590> been<00:01:17.310> cut<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:18.150> over

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420

them<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> stump<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.610> zoom<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> tight

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
them just to stump now we zoom in tight

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.670 
them just to stump now we zoom in tight
on<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> stump<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.549> see

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
on that stump and that's all we can see

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.810 
on that stump and that's all we can see
and<00:01:25.680> i<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.950> most<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> problems<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and i think most of the problems that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.359 
and i think most of the problems that
human<00:01:27.180> beings<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:28.979> zoomed

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
human beings have is that we are zoomed

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.429 
human beings have is that we are zoomed
in<00:01:29.610> too<00:01:29.970> tight<00:01:31.130> onto<00:01:32.130> something<00:01:32.729> negative<00:01:32.909> or

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
in too tight onto something negative or

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.600 
in too tight onto something negative or
onto<00:01:34.439> some<00:01:34.650> future<00:01:35.070> goal

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
onto some future goal

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.860 
onto some future goal
because<00:01:37.610> when<00:01:37.760> you're<00:01:37.910> zoomed<00:01:38.180> in<00:01:38.390> really

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
because when you're zoomed in really

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.230 
because when you're zoomed in really
really<00:01:38.990> tight<00:01:39.440> you're<00:01:40.370> warping<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.060> light

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
really tight you're warping the light

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.350 
really tight you're warping the light
your<00:01:41.480> warping<00:01:42.070> reality<00:01:43.070> you're<00:01:43.850> ignoring

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
your warping reality you're ignoring

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.660 
your warping reality you're ignoring
most<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> information<00:01:46.010> that's<00:01:46.490> available

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
most of the information that's available

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.540 
most of the information that's available
to<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:48.320> when<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.590> zoom<00:01:48.830> out<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.310> take<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
to you but when you zoom out and take a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.110 
to you but when you zoom out and take a
wide<00:01:49.970> angle<00:01:50.390> perspective<00:01:51.220> suddenly<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.850> much

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
wide angle perspective suddenly so much

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.200 
wide angle perspective suddenly so much
more<00:01:53.360> information<00:01:54.020> becomes<00:01:54.170> available<00:01:55.210> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
more information becomes available and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.880 
more information becomes available and
when<00:01:56.300> you<00:01:56.420> zoom<00:01:56.600> out<00:01:56.780> from<00:01:57.050> that<00:01:57.170> stump<00:01:57.620> you

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
when you zoom out from that stump you

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.360 
when you zoom out from that stump you
look<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.310> there's<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.550> whole<00:01:58.730> forest<00:01:59.090> around

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
look and there's a whole forest around

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.440 
look and there's a whole forest around
that<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.490> couldn't<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.030> when<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.330> were

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that you couldn't see when you were

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.780 
that you couldn't see when you were

zoomed in on the stump your perspective

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.900 
zoomed in on the stump your perspective
was<00:02:04.940> too<00:02:05.090> narrow<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:06.350> focus<00:02:06.460> was<00:02:07.460> too<00:02:07.670> narrow

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
was too narrow your focus was too narrow

all<00:02:08.630> those<00:02:08.869> trees<00:02:09.140> were<00:02:09.350> still<00:02:09.590> there

on your car he's got a little saying on
the<00:03:56.269> bottom<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.569> says<00:03:56.720> objects<00:03:57.349> of<00:03:57.500> this

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
the bottom that says objects of this

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.599 
the bottom that says objects of this
mirror<00:03:57.920> may<00:03:58.159> be<00:03:58.189> closer<00:03:58.609> than<00:03:58.879> they<00:03:59.629> appear

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
mirror may be closer than they appear

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.979 
mirror may be closer than they appear
because<00:04:01.609> that<00:04:01.760> mirrors<00:04:02.060> worked<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.629> little<00:04:02.750> bit

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
because that mirrors worked a little bit

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.460 
because that mirrors worked a little bit
to<00:04:03.439> give<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:03.739> wider<00:04:04.189> perspective<00:04:05.470> so

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
to give you a wider perspective so

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.229 
to give you a wider perspective so
things<00:04:06.709> seem<00:04:06.950> further<00:04:07.430> away<00:04:07.639> than<00:04:07.939> they<00:04:08.090> are

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
things seem further away than they are

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.940 
things seem further away than they are
in<00:04:10.599> this<00:04:11.599> frightens<00:04:12.019> people<00:04:12.109> when<00:04:12.799> their

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
in this frightens people when their

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.479 
in this frightens people when their
dreams<00:04:13.250> get<00:04:13.579> further<00:04:13.879> and<00:04:14.120> further<00:04:14.180> away

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
dreams get further and further away

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.680 
dreams get further and further away
because<00:04:16.489> then<00:04:16.729> they're<00:04:16.880> left<00:04:17.060> with<00:04:17.150> what<00:04:17.479> is

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
because then they're left with what is

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.349 
because then they're left with what is
right<00:04:17.959> here<00:04:18.699> now<00:04:19.699> what<00:04:19.849> if<00:04:19.940> they<00:04:20.030> don't<00:04:20.120> like

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
right here now what if they don't like

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.260 
right here now what if they don't like
what<00:04:20.419> he's<00:04:20.810> right<00:04:21.109> here<00:04:21.289> most<00:04:21.500> people<00:04:21.829> don't

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
what he's right here most people don't

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.180 
what he's right here most people don't
so<00:04:23.270> they<00:04:23.449> zoom<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:23.900> onto<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.349> fantasy<00:04:24.770> onto

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
so they zoom in onto that fantasy onto

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.129 
so they zoom in onto that fantasy onto
that<00:04:25.310> delusion<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:25.970> they<00:04:26.479> try<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.750> build<00:04:26.960> a

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
that delusion and they try to build a

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.500 
that delusion and they try to build a
tree<00:04:27.409> out<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.860> they<00:04:28.520> try<00:04:28.729> to<00:04:28.789> construct<00:04:29.180> a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
tree out of it they try to construct a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.610 
tree out of it they try to construct a
tree<00:04:30.190> with<00:04:31.190> no<00:04:31.340> foundation<00:04:32.229> so<00:04:33.229> it's<00:04:33.380> really

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
tree with no foundation so it's really

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.510 
tree with no foundation so it's really
easy<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.919> topple<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.370> one<00:04:34.610> over<00:04:36.370> but<00:04:37.370> when

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
easy to topple that one over but when

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.159 
easy to topple that one over but when
you<00:04:37.610> zoom<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.479> stand<00:04:38.750> here<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:38.990> say

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
you zoom out and you stand here and say

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.020 
you zoom out and you stand here and say
wow<00:04:39.380> okay<00:04:39.770> look<00:04:40.159> at<00:04:40.280> all<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:40.490> stuff<00:04:40.699> I<00:04:40.880> can

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
wow okay look at all this stuff I can

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.680 
wow okay look at all this stuff I can
see<00:04:41.270> maybe<00:04:42.199> it's<00:04:42.409> not<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:42.770> future<00:04:43.449> but<00:04:44.449> I<00:04:44.510> can

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
see maybe it's not that future but I can

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.200 
see maybe it's not that future but I can
do<00:04:44.780> something<00:04:45.080> with<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.860> can<00:04:46.580> create<00:04:46.940> with
