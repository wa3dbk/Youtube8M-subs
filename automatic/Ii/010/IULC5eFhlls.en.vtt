world so that is quite literally it and

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.890 
world so that is quite literally it and
then<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:25.770> hit<00:05:25.979> play<00:05:26.160> here<00:05:26.610> cut<00:05:27.600> once<00:05:27.780> we

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
then you just hit play here cut once we

then you just hit play here cut once we
enter<00:05:28.199> my<00:05:28.290> password<00:05:28.560> twice<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.250> lets<00:05:29.430> me<00:05:29.520> into

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
enter my password twice it lets me into

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.200 
enter my password twice it lets me into
my<00:05:29.910> pants<00:05:30.150> were<00:05:30.389> consistent<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.800> will

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
my pants were consistent and it will

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.540 
my pants were consistent and it will
load<00:05:36.210> up<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.630> game<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.889> it's<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.220> lot<00:05:38.340> quicker

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
load up the game and it's a lot quicker

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.780 
load up the game and it's a lot quicker
to<00:05:38.790> load<00:05:38.970> than<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.780> old<00:05:39.900> chaosville<00:05:40.200> is<00:05:40.790> the

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
to load than the old chaosville is the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.520 
to load than the old chaosville is the
whole<00:05:41.940> castle<00:05:42.240> used<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.690> take<00:05:42.840> 20<00:05:42.990> minutes<00:05:43.169> or

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
whole castle used to take 20 minutes or

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.500 
whole castle used to take 20 minutes or
so<00:05:43.560> this<00:05:44.070> should<00:05:44.340> only<00:05:44.460> take<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.820> max<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.389> about

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
so this should only take a max of about

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.440 
so this should only take a max of about
eight<00:05:46.410> with<00:05:46.889> a<00:05:46.919> 200<00:05:47.430> make<00:05:47.610> texture<00:05:48.030> pack<00:05:48.210> if

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
eight with a 200 make texture pack if

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.050 
eight with a 200 make texture pack if
you're<00:05:48.600> using<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:50.370> then<00:05:50.550> what<00:05:50.729> you<00:05:50.910> can
