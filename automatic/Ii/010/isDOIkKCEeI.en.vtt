because the symptoms of having a bad
blend<00:00:22.970> or<00:00:23.210> actuator<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:24.259> that<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.100> will<00:00:25.250> get

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
blend or actuator is that you will get

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.120 
blend or actuator is that you will get
heat<00:00:26.060> in<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.689> back<00:00:26.869> part<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.380> van<00:00:27.590> from<00:00:27.859> from

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
to replace this actuator and see if it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.729 
to replace this actuator and see if it
fixes<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.400> what<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.420> have<00:00:38.660> are<00:00:39.199> a<00:00:39.260> couple<00:00:39.620> of
