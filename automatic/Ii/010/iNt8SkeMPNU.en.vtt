recommend<00:00:38.070> using<00:00:38.250> these<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.960> these<00:00:39.960> mega

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
recommend using these are these mega

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
recommend using these are these mega
downloads<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.030> seem<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.270> be

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
downloads here because they seem to be

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
downloads here because they seem to be
the<00:00:42.510> quickest<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> sign

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the quickest and you don't have to sign

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.400 
the quickest and you don't have to sign
up<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.160> account<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> definitely<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
up for an account so I definitely go to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.029 
up for an account so I definitely go to
these<00:00:46.829> ones<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.879> mega<00:00:48.059> downloads<00:00:49.039> there

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
these ones here the mega downloads there

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.560 
these ones here the mega downloads there
are<00:00:50.100> quite<00:00:50.280> large<00:00:50.430> downloads<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
are quite large downloads well the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
are quite large downloads well the
actual<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.649> content<00:00:53.190> download<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
actual game content download is the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
actual game content download is the
largest<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.780> around<00:00:54.989> 600

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
largest I think it's around 600

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
largest I think it's around 600
megabytes<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.910> might<00:00:57.090> take<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> little

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
megabytes so that might take a little

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
megabytes so that might take a little
while<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.050> once<00:00:58.980> you've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.309> them

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
while but once you've got them

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.349 
while but once you've got them
downloaded<00:01:01.699> you<00:01:02.699> should<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.300> two

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
downloaded you should have these two

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.670 
downloaded you should have these two
