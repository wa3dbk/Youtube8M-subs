00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 I said you ruined my life 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 decent house masses in an asylum 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.160
 My my god what happens to you was the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.239

 gone this is the misfortune will never be 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.040
 this is a new shock therapy 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.040
 now 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.500
 then the psychiatrist draws a circle 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.910
 says what you think seeing this is though 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.020
 the real finished moment says sex 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.850
 draw a tree 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.650
 this makes you think of that sex 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.959
 then draw a car a house e 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.760
 that same sex sex and the doctor 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.760
 she says she 's obsessed with sex and here 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.590
 I've never made her that of port lilies 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.269
 your request for admission for 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.610
 spare yourself any barbaric embarrassment 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.909
 you have been sent by the ethical art of a 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.010
 narcissist is a pale partner study 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.500
 astute to be able to deceive the whole 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.209
 my team I have my doubts via e 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.239
 perfectly natural that a patient 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.489
 stick to your analyst and if you want 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.349
 freeing him will suffice to tell him that 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.870
 not the most preferred cure easier for 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.670
 sending him that man is a human whore 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.159
 you never had to sleep with yours 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.069
 I can't believe my pajamas there 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.389
 relaxed ears there I am relaxed 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.650
 take a vacation I'm the fool 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.540
 why don't you admit yourself here some 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.540
 day and find your serenity 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.270
 it was an interesting day 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.860
 but that intensity was lacking 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.980
 that we two generate together 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
 sparks of our singular encounters 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.650
 we need to be able to review one 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.740
 space between his commitments 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.959
 we work in the afternoon from two to 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.070
 four from the three queens on Monday 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.070
 Wednesday 20 Saturday and Sunday 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.990
 prefer the morning already washed the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.230
 ours is a non-fuel relationship 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.040
 it is true that it happens only as I do 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.040
 happens with everyone 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.370
 what is this isolation therapy
