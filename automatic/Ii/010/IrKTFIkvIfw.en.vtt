is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.020> pretty<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.320> unplayed

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
is that it's pretty much unplayed

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
is that it's pretty much unplayed
because<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.820> sits<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> case<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.810> my

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
