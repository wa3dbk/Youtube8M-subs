00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.759
 HallÃ¶chen and we come back on 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:12.929
 my channel in the new video is about 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:15.420
 the flex wacker hello and sincerely 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.230
 Welcome back to a temple in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 this video is about the flex marca 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.869
 I go two days ago 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 ordered and they arrived now 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 then I will link you in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.849
 innsbrucks to do and they were there 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 just in the offer for two euros that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 piece then I thought so try me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.360
 look at it and why drews clearly 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 like a video to those so there's 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
 Now the review and yes I thought 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 Let's take a look at the marca 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.789
 I also draw a comparison to the top 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 picks and yes the driver directly 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:56.789
 So you already see the design of the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:59.100
 flex marca hereof the lettering i 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.829
 have to say they are relatively big 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 compared to the top brands to the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.770
 Original actually almost as big 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.200
 and wide 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.740
 Let's take a look at the brush tip 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.210
 So that's the first island tip 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.130
 that is in comparison to the top picks 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 as an addition to the original comic mag 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 can be both the size and for 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 a shape they are these very much here 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 similar or identical already 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.200
 once at the other side the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.500
 you know that original comic lace 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 is this here and sex was 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.909
 I actually found it very interesting 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 I was a little bit surprised when I 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.970
 that opened because I know about it 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.009
 probably looks like this now 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 fell in the first moment thinking it hevert it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.409
 reminds me of the head or 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.409
 sketch though 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 These are not really identical 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.290
 And I have to say that the brush 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.070
 tip harder than this is so the 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:17.000
 Form comes can be bent so nice 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.300
 and just this waveform and that of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.490
 Although flex walker is on this world 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.680
 But the tip is harder here 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.280
 rather , I can do it myself 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.200
 bend 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.060
 which I really do not do 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.680
 negative for the name more precise 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.780
 colorize as for example with the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 tip of the comic sketch or the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.080
 comic look so we come now 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 assignment 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.320
 i will now paint all of you which i will 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.480
 bought me are these four pieces 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.590
 hazards 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:57.320
 Once upon a time there is blood stain pastel green 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.630
 he heard you and pink lavender 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.880
 Apply now quickly and then 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.880
 has collapsed again report 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.030
 So what I can say is 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.920
 that this oblique point something 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.570
 I can apply unevenly 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
 times close back to the processing 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.570
 because if I carry on I will 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 If you can see that, here you are 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.520
 this area is here and filled up 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.270
 so to speak 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.580
 you really have to draw at an angle 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.190
 hold the pen at an angle so that they are 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.280
 Apply precisely when you can 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.250
 just on wears then it will not work 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.310
 quite as good as what I can say is 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.930
 that the colors look really great 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.980
 So the color intensity is really good 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.240
 and they are nice too 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.830
 Blend is no stripes to see 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.180
 I still have a point of criticism 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.930
 because like here it probably comes 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.500
 not so over but on the packaging 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.370
 is it really a red a red and red 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.150
 on my paper it is more of a 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.460
 instinct of the red go with the others 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.650
 colors that actually fits with the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.360
 packed with the packing of a 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.169
 Now I'm going to look like her 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 with the comics blind so 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:40.110
 I first got up and I want it 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.270
 now blind with these cases blue 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.110
 which is pretty difficult 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.090
 because like you see it kassab really 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.250
 difference but I already see that 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.870
 works very well 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:57.360
 There was even something very good underneath 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.850
 still working with this site by 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.560
 topic then it sounds a little better 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.370
 works that worked great so 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.410
 I am already positively surprised 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.940
 To the durability of the flex market 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.860
 Unfortunately, I can not say that much yet 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.050
 but i will definitely update 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.690
 to write on my facebook page 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.270
 I do not know if the flex brand 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.500
 fill up as well as the cockpit marco 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.590
 hepp to unfortunately nothing on the internet 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.900
 found so I speculate now 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.810
 because they do not fill up 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.949
 to let 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.960
 I do not do it personally now 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.659
 I like the comics as well 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.020
 never on filler decision conclusion is price 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:42.190
 I have now for 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.580
 these four lexmark a8 euro spent 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.620
 which is really not much for 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.340
 A comic I think you even pay 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.349
 so around seven euros so this 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.940
 original comics and for that I have now 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.129
 get four pieces 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.710
 I think I will be even more 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.379
 Order me a little better 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.310
 than that is alpha brand schauma review 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:12.310
 Tave just because of this flexible brush 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.810
 Tip I hope you have the video 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.460
 Please do not hesitate to ask 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.080
 Flex rackets have me driving on everyone 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.080
 case in the comments or in the 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.940
 message or on facebook that you 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.039
 like a rating there and an abo 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.279
 I'm looking forward to see you next time 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.279
 bye
