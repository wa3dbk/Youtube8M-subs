00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 brought a microphone what is the story 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.680
 of this microphone is a day then he he 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 does not have any particular stories but 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 me I collect a microphone a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 forty years because if there is 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.340
 was not that there would not be that I want 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.140
 say in his rights only 250 jeans 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 claude you take over from the big 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.829
 roger carel how was this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.229
 reports 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.939
 this shift happened happened 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.460
 extremely well because roger had me 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.960
 already asked for more than 15 years ago 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.179
 to make the voice sung douini in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.409
 connecting on his spoken voice so we have 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.750
 worked together both as 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 that for years and when he has 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.799
 decided to stop 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 it's our game always says with 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.219
 a lot of emotion it's our master 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.390
 it's our pope in quotation marks to all 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.890
 and I try me I do my best to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 respect what he did because this 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.399
 that they asked me is to try to be 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.119
 as close as possible to roger 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.369
 precisely to ensure this continuity 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 jedi ahsoka tano and missing in 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 mission 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.330
 captured and then released into the heart of a 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 hostile jungle they struggle to stay 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.300
 alive with the help of a small group of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.640
 young novices to the jedi it must be said 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 also jean-claude that you have a palette 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 very impressive vocal 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.599
 when we look at syria gorgue and there 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 there we see that you do more than 80 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.190
 voice about gerard's role then 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.470
 huge work I'm doing this series with 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.160
 something quite unlikely in 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.410
 pub session 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.239
