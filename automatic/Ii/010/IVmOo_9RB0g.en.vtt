00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.260
 who does not like a traditional study 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
 of apple 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.020
 because it's this candy we're going to learn today 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.520
 the apple strudel was never missing at the party 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 from our regional at my grandmother's house 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.460
 after my mother today in line 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.269
 I'll do is apple with honey. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 exactly because it's triggering a recipe 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 simplified because making the dough is a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 It would delight us but it would take us almost 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.700
 whole day then I will use a mass already 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 soon the result is almost even 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.789
 exactly pencil and paper in hand and let's 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.809
 the apple strudel ingredients one 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.140
 puff pastry cut into March 5th dreams 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.980
 small pieces 100 grams of pass 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 these 100 grams of Brazil nuts 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 sugar confectioner cinnamon honey and an egg 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:09.979
 but small cutaway bark shows 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.710
 a mass of four to five apples 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:19.610
 raisins can be used either the dark one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.610
 clear plus three spoons of raisin 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 Nuts I chose to use Brazil nuts 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.479
 to get more brazilian brown 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:39.880
 Brazil is now called as bite but 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:39.880
 without 120 grams cinnamon cinnamon is the good 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.350
 my study does not take sugar because I 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.009
 I think the apple I prefer to use the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.520
 own is apple sugar 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.940
 I'm going to make a different model of the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 traditional study to look beautiful in 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.470
 presentation time at a table of us 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:10.280
 without rolling as if it were a 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:13.730
 Cigar generated sticks because it facilitates 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 so the filling does not come out from behind the other 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.480
 part 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.860
 an easy mass to work because you 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.800
 can return and fix it time 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.530
 all even though she has no problem open 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.680
 I'll give you one more option that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.880
 It's also beautiful on the link table. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.070
 You cut an apple in a square. 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.420
 if you do not have a way like this 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:51.910
 use the way you have at home you 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.610
 mold it stuffs make a rustic shape 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.030
 even though I eat the puff pastry a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.100
 mass it will grow misshapen 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.380
 she has no problem at all having a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.280
 format the closure in the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.610
 justice 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.150
 to finish before going to the oven 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.730
 the whole beaten egg with a little 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.910
 I do not like to put the oil in 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.530
 little bit of water mix up 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.709
 before the oven puts a little 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.700
 cinnamon and think money gives only one 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.130
 candy 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.900
 now goes to the oven 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.920
 Pasta is the puff like tall oven 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.560
 for about 20 minutes when 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.560
 have native crispy browned time 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.459
 taking after 20 minutes or 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.910
 any less 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.910
 our structure is ready, serginho 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.850
 have to if my a spanking that really 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.280
 It's good for China, it's not for us. 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.800
 midras we want a show at the current goal 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.640

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.640
