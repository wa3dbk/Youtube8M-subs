00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 the new president of the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.440
 san sebastian san sabesp 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620
 Kherson Kelman said that the crisis in 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 water supply is serious and that 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 everyone should be prepared for the worst 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.619
 Is it worse than that? 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.800
 with the heavy rains of the last days 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.720
 reservoirs continue to surround the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 path to change still appears in a 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 mega that haunted the paulistanos in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.079
 2014 remains the stone in the way and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.629
 2015 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.850
 the most scarce reservoir 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.960
 responsible for the supply of eight 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 millions of people in the region 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 metropolitan of são paulo amargou 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.190
 exact 332 days of fall and almost lost 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.590
 half a trillion liters of water 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 drought in the jaguari dam has revealed 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.890
 ruins of a centennial church of all 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 the reservoirs supplying 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.129
 municipalities and states 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.740
 The only one that went up from yesterday to today was 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 the big river the guarapiranga remained 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.650
 stable 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 the high tietê registered fall as well as 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.330
 light river and the high cotia 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 if the solution does not come from heaven and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 now run against time. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 to avoid wastage the account of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 water can increase by up to 50% for those who 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 consume more 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.479
 who knows how to reuse the water has space 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 in the market 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.460
 drought forces the population to think 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 and when to use the best way possible 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 Such a precious good. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 it is no wonder that this company 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.090
 specialized in reuse of water and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 has had 30% more orders in recent 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 months a portable treatment system 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.280
 in which five thousand liters of water can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 be treated for separate dirt 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.689
 and is retained in the decanter is not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 considered safe drinking water but can 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.729
 to be reused car wash by 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.939
 example 10 to 20 times 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.729
 the economy is immediate about 70% of 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.680
 financial savings on the water bill 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.259
 because the course of drinking water very 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.560
 and the cost of reuse water is 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.690
 infinitely lower 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.000
 in times of water scarcity and not 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.000
 can dry up are good ideas
