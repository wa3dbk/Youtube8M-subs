like a curve and I guess that you can
you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:49.730> post<00:02:50.730> these<00:02:51.650> what's<00:02:52.650> these

quite a bit of construction going on

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.540 
quite a bit of construction going on

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.950 
am dear to see in the hotel you actually
have<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.280> an<00:03:11.400> artist<00:03:11.850> applet<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
have a like an artist applet that you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.760 
have a like an artist applet that you
can<00:03:13.110> use<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:14.030> control<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.240> lightning<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.140> a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
can use to control the lightning and a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.270 
can use to control the lightning and a
for<00:03:16.950> example<00:03:17.460> our<00:03:17.730> air<00:03:18.300> conditioning<00:03:19.130> do<00:03:20.130> not

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
for example our air conditioning do not

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.400 
for example our air conditioning do not
disturb<00:03:20.850> um<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.400> arms<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.300> cannot<00:03:24.660> use

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
disturb um and arms but you cannot use

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.230 
disturb um and arms but you cannot use
this<00:03:25.620> chill<00:03:26.040> arm<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:29.520> close<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> curtain

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
this chill arm to to close the curtain

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
this chill arm to to close the curtain
so<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> currents<00:03:30.960> are<00:03:31.110> not<00:03:31.470> automatic<00:03:33.260> in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so the currents are not automatic in

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.370 
so the currents are not automatic in
other<00:03:34.470> words<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.630> otherwise<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.960> location

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
other words and otherwise the location
