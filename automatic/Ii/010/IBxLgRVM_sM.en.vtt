00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 new mascara I'm bought 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 tell you that this mascara 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 I've heard very very good reviews about 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.180
 her so that's why I decided to buy them 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.710
 so I can show you in the video my 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.780
 First impression on this mask 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.610
 eyelashes since so far I have not 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.440
 tried and I just opened it right now 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.480
 the mascara of what I'm 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.379
 speaking is this from here that the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.699
 effects of butterfly wings of l'oréal 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.730

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.550
 you know the little brush is pretty funny 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.040
 has as well as if it were a comb he cited 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.780
 very tiny in different ways and the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.670
 truth is that it looks pretty good 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.620
 as I say that I have heard very good 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.150
 criticism of it and I've even seen it 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.340
 how it is applied and the truth is that 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.839
 It makes very beautiful eyelashes and 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.519
 now I'll read you a little bit what 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.379
 says the official page of l'oréal that 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.210
 affect mask and make it on your page 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.160
 that using this mascara 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.860
 we will get a spectacular effects 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.020
 butterfly wings eyelash volume 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.330
 from the root and elevated at the ends 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.460
 thanks to the great innovation of our 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.840
 butterfly wing effect brush as already 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 you have seen is a pretty brush 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 you will get your eyelashes 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 they see him as the wings of a butterfly 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.570
 he says he has not innovations 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.880
 your ingredients for the first time I will 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.220
 al paris creates an asymmetric brush with 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.410
 Butterfly wing shape has one side 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.050
 ergonomic that captures and bulky all 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.940
 the eyelashes and the other side of what shape 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.190
 that the wing rises and extends the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.259
 eyelashes of the ends of the eye and good 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.539
 this is what I did the official page of 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.520
 l'oréal I hope you're right and do 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.899
 that effect and I start to show you how 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.759
 he applied the mask and starts 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.690
 apply the mascara on this 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.730
 case yo 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.030
 curled my eyelash a little bit with a 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.030
 crimper 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 I hope you're looking good I'm 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.670
 using the part this is a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.040
 little bit higher up to see if what 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.610
 You can see this part of the brush in 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.610
 the one I'm using 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.930
 and see how it goes 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.990
 the truth is that so far I see 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 that is a little liquid but good 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.170
 it is normal is the mascara 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.170
 when you are newly opened 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.440
 the truth is that quite difficult that 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.390
 you can grasp well how I am applying 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 the mascara since not to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.370
 have any kind of mirror then good 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.069
 I can not work them enough 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 comfortable so you can see well but 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.010
 well I will continue to apply the mask 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.870
 of tabs and once you have finished 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.910
 already there will be design the result without 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.099
 tell you that it dries pretty fast 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.019
 the mascara so if 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.180
 you want to give it two layers you are careful 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.590
 that does not dry very fast, comment 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 also how good until I catch you 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.610
 a little bit of the trick to this brush 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.260
 maybe a little bit of lumps or 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.000
 it gets together a little bit to the eyelashes but 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.370
 the truth is that the tile pretty pretty 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.650
 yes I like the result a lot 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.420
 I do not know how you will see it now 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.310
 I teach how it looks like this together 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.110
 that you see that they highlight quite and good 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.880
 that's how the eyelash mask looks 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.230
 As you can see, it leaves a very very 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.329
 open the truth is that I liked 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.709
 very much the result I do not know how 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.959
 you will see but I see the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.000
 pretty separate and pretty lashes 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.560
 long to tell you that you have to have a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.750
 little bit of care because when you leave 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.489
 eyelashes up to larguita you can paint 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.870
 this part of here can stain a 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.579
 little but good as you know is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.210
 matter of letting it dry and removing it with 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.610
 something 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.650
 wet and that's the truth is that has me 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.450
 surprised very much this mask of 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.370
 eyelashes I did not think I was going to leave a few 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.110
 nice eyelashes yes that's true 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.670
 How good is it to take a little bit of 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.800
 I trick this brush because it's a little bit 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.870
 weird but the truth is that they comb 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.970
 pretty good and it applies quite 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.160
 comfortable comment also that it dries 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.720
 pretty fast the formula so if 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.490
 you are thinking about giving a second layer 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.560
 like me in my case that has applied two 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.110
 layers the second a little more finite 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.850
 to say it somehow you have to 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.400
 Be careful because it dries super super 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.170
 fast and then it's much more uncomfortable 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.030
 tell me that I liked it very much 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.980
 As you can see, he has also applied mask 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.290
 lashes the lower lashes and I leave 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.540
 super super long lashes I do not know to 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.400
 I liked very much to comment 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.990
 that has reminded me a lot of the effect that 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.040
 Leave me the reel eyelash mask 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.930
 of benefit if some day you are interested 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.760
 see it I can make a comparison between 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.680
 the reel of benefit with this mask 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.780
 of tabs comment in case you do not 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.220
 you know that in one of my last videos 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.500
 I think in a product video 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.750
 favorites or something like that I teach you the 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.780
 Comparison between the mascara 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.520
 of renders 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.380
 with another mask of eyelashes 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.090
 mercadona and one of mixed mascara 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.770
 let's say it makes a similar effect like that 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.360
 that your interest to go through the video 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.910
 leave under the information box 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.710
 so that you see if it interests and good 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.600
 I tell you that I liked so much I have been 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.940
 seemed to have an effect similar to 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.530
 this mascara and the truth is 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.650
 which is quite interesting since the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.450
 benefit costs about 24 euros 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.090
 approximately and this costs as few 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.400
 14 or as you know l'oréal la 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.510
 you can find in countless shops 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.840
 You can find it even in 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.460
 supermarkets such as eroski carrefour 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.140
 alcampo I will also find them 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.940
 Obviously in makeup stores 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.590
 as a beauty that will surely be the 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.780
 cheaper places you can find them 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.540
 I bought it in a store in this case 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.370
 in a very large supermarket that had 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.440
 a 15% discount and I went around 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.300
 about 13 euros so I remember 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.979
 exactly but that's why it is 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.350
 true that it's not the mask anymore for 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.850
 cheaper than I have tried but the 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.050
 truth is worth quite worth 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.850
 taking into account all that I've 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.710
 tried quality-price I think it's 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.169
 very very good and that only has 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.879
 been a first impression 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.939
 The truth is that I recommend it a lot 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.169
 so I liked it very much and good 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.310
 so far today's video I hope that 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.050
 I liked that it seemed 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.639
 interesting to tell you that I have thought 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.379
 making more of this style as 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.939
 I find them very interesting I have seen 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.189
 several youtube girls make videos 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.529
 referring to this subject using mask 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.939
 of tabs telling your opinion how to 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.409
 apply them and the truth also I 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.539
 they love it so I've thought that to 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.159
 you may like us too and if 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.110
 good if you want me to try some 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.029
 eyelash mask in concrete me what 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.379
 leave in the information box of 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.150
 every way I have enough of 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.039
 eyelash mask by showing you for 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.779
 that you see how they are and all those 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.310
 little things, also comment before 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.749
 I forgot that if you want to know 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.909
 what basis of makeup in which he took 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.409
 today applied in this makeup in the 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.259

 next to this surely I will teach you 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.919
 what basis of makeup am I using 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.300
 which in this case is the face pink it is 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.129
 the max factor 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.620
 so if you want to know a little more 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.449
