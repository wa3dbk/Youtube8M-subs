you<00:00:20.220> guys<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.699> show<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> do<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
you guys and show you how I do the

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.890 
you guys and show you how I do the
initial<00:00:22.500> install<00:00:22.920> without<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.900> basically

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
initial install without it and basically

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.710 
initial install without it and basically
what<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> will<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> also<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> snippet<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
what I will do is also have a snippet in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
what I will do is also have a snippet in
the<00:00:27.840> beginning<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> video<00:00:28.619> where<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.550> show

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the beginning of the video where I show

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.609 
the beginning of the video where I show
you<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.330> colored<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> can

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
you how I colored it because as you can

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.619 
you how I colored it because as you can
see<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.099> some<00:00:32.369> lighter<00:00:32.850> tones<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
see there is some lighter tones at the

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.719 
see there is some lighter tones at the
bottom<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.230> basically<00:00:34.799> what<00:00:35.220> I<00:00:35.250> did<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:35.729 
bottom and basically what I did is I

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.009 
bottom and basically what I did is I
kind<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> colored<00:00:36.330> it<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> certain<00:00:36.809> way<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
kind of colored it a certain way to

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.719 
kind of colored it a certain way to
where<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.589> would<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:38.010> dimensions<00:00:38.549> to

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:38.729 
where there would be some dimensions to

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.570 
where there would be some dimensions to
it<00:00:38.960> focus<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> okay<00:00:40.650> yes<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.549> be

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
it focus it okay yes so there would be

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.090 
it focus it okay yes so there would be
some<00:00:41.640> dimensions<00:00:42.299> to<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.409> yeah<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
some dimensions to it and yeah so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.829 
some dimensions to it and yeah so
without<00:00:44.339> further<00:00:44.549> ado<00:00:44.909> if<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.360> guys<00:00:45.570> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there can be a little bit dimension to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
there can be a little bit dimension to
it<00:00:55.010> because<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.580> it<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:57.089> be<00:00:57.239> one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800 
Kaleidoscope grab one for you guys
the<00:01:13.230> Kaleidoscope<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.730> blue<00:01:14.910> peg<00:01:15.150> weird

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the Kaleidoscope in the blue peg weird

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
the Kaleidoscope in the blue peg weird
huh<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.440> how<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.010> has<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.310> blue

you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.570 

so<00:01:30.630> basically<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> did<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.130> can't

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
so basically what I did because I can't

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.910 
so basically what I did because I can't
really<00:01:32.729> break<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> did<00:01:34.619> for

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
really break it down well what I did for

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.520 
really break it down well what I did for
this<00:01:35.040> length<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.030> pulled<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.080> hair<00:01:37.290> back

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this length was I pulled on my hair back

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.490 
this length was I pulled on my hair back
I<00:01:37.890> tied<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.549> into<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.970> scrunchie<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I tied it into a scrunchie and then I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.010 
I tied it into a scrunchie and then I
plaited<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.940> normal<00:01:42.299> flat<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
plaited it like just so normal flat and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230 
plaited it like just so normal flat and
then<00:01:43.409> i'm<00:01:43.530> bobby<00:01:43.770> pin<00:01:44.130> dick<00:01:44.310> console<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.090> lay

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
then i'm bobby pin dick console will lay

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.320 
then i'm bobby pin dick console will lay
flat<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.649> when<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> install<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
flat just for when I install it so it

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.910 
flat just for when I install it so it
won't<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.659> bulky<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.440> as<00:01:49.560> flat<00:01:49.799> as

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
won't be bulky and would be as flat as

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
won't be bulky and would be as flat as
possible<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.360> party<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:51.960> front

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
possible and I also party at my front

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
possible and I also party at my front
because<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.310> I'll<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.789> actually<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
because what I'll do is actually have a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
because what I'll do is actually have a
little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:55.080> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> pulled<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.340> where

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
little bit kind of pulled back to where

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
little bit kind of pulled back to where
it<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.820> look<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.539> realistic<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it will look a little more realistic and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
it will look a little more realistic and
I<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.950> shouldn't<00:01:59.220> gas<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.729> once<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.030> put<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I really shouldn't gas out once I put it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.029 
I really shouldn't gas out once I put it

does<00:03:53.430> look<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.939> you're<00:03:54.629> not<00:03:54.810> realistic<00:03:55.230> card

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709

a<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:56.189> bit<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.549> then<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.849> do<00:03:56.909> have<00:03:57.030> my<00:03:57.450> hair

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
a little bit and then I do have my hair

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.839 
a little bit and then I do have my hair
party<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.709> that'd<00:03:58.889> be<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.159> next<00:03:59.430> stuff<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.819> I

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
party so that'd be the next stuff that I

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.289 
party so that'd be the next stuff that I
do<00:03:59.969> and<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.450> does<00:04:00.659> fit<00:04:00.959> snug<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.819> like<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.030> said

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
do and it does fit snug so like I said

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.179 
do and it does fit snug so like I said
