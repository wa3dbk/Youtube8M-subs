to<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:23.340> usually<00:01:23.640> already

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to do it so it's usually already

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
hair or anything like that so it makes

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.380 
hair or anything like that so it makes
it<00:01:27.660> really<00:01:27.810> easy<00:01:28.250> once<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> because

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it really easy once I get it because

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.270 
it really easy once I get it because
it's<00:01:30.660> really<00:01:30.900> long<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:31.890> cut<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.160> in

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it's really long I kind of cut it in

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.610 
it's really long I kind of cut it in
half<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.660> length<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:34.140> gets<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
half and that's the length that gets you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.760 
half and that's the length that gets you
this<00:01:35.490> length<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.110> works

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
this length right here and this works

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
this length right here and this works
for<00:01:38.070> me

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
for me

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.490 
for me
so<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.100> take<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.820> piece<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so what I do is I take a piece kind of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
so what I do is I take a piece kind of
like<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> after<00:01:44.100> I've<00:01:44.190> cut<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:45.210> like

years now to kind of you know I learned
how<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.120> could<00:03:06.299> save<00:03:06.510> money

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
how to do it so I could save money

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.500 
how to do it so I could save money
because<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.260> was<00:03:07.380> paying<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.459> $200<00:03:09.360> or<00:03:09.480> more

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
because I was paying like $200 or more

because I was paying like $200 or more
to<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.110> done<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.489> me<00:03:11.700> I'm

to get this done and you know me I'm

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.809 
to get this done and you know me I'm
always<00:03:12.840> trying<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> save<00:03:13.440> money<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:14.490> anyway

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
always trying to save money but anyway

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.200 
always trying to save money but anyway
so<00:03:15.260> once<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.530> good<00:03:16.740> at<00:03:16.770> it

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
so once you get good at it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.090 
so once you get good at it
kind<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:18.200> know<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.890> or

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
kind of you know do it like this or

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.440 
kind of you know do it like this or
maybe<00:03:19.370> even<00:03:19.640> faster<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> I'm<00:03:21.830> gonna<00:03:22.270> do<00:03:23.270> this

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
maybe even faster so I'm gonna do this

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.740 
maybe even faster so I'm gonna do this
all<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.690> way<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:23.960> and<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.730> what<00:03:26.510> some

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
all the way down and then what some

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.870 
all the way down and then what some
people<00:03:26.960> like<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.410> do<00:03:27.800> once<00:03:28.280> they<00:03:28.430> get<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
people like to do once they get to the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.380 
people like to do once they get to the
end<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.450> they<00:03:31.540> either<00:03:32.540> braid<00:03:32.960> it<00:03:33.200> or<00:03:34.240> with<00:03:35.240> this

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
end is they either braid it or with this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.310 
end is they either braid it or with this
type<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.630> hair<00:03:37.120> particularly<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.360> can<00:03:38.630> twist

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
type of hair particularly you can twist

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.740 
type of hair particularly you can twist
it<00:03:39.560> all<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.800> way<00:03:39.980> down<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.520> I<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.420> often

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
it all the way down and I do that often

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.940 
it all the way down and I do that often
only<00:03:42.200> because<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:43.340> easier<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.790> take<00:03:44.030> out<00:03:44.950> for

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
only because it's easier to take out for

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.730 
only because it's easier to take out for
me<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.280> know<00:03:46.490> it's<00:03:47.210> really<00:03:47.600> fast<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.080> take<00:03:48.500> out

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
me you know it's really fast to take out

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.720 
me you know it's really fast to take out
so<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.640> kind<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:50.870> twist<00:03:51.710> it<00:03:52.130> all<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.550> way

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
so I kind of just twist it all the way

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.220 
so I kind of just twist it all the way
down<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.240> very<00:03:53.570> very<00:03:53.720> end<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.080> very

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
down to the very very end to the very

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.310 
down to the very very end to the very
end<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.610> then<00:04:01.670> once<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.510> get<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.870> very<00:04:03.080> very

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
end and then once I get to the very very

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.560 
end and then once I get to the very very
very<00:04:03.620> end<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:04.220> do<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.000> quick<00:04:05.270> little

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
very end I do it like a quick little

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.160 
very end I do it like a quick little
palm<00:04:05.780> roll<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.740> that<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.750> give<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.960> palm

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
palm roll like that I give it a palm

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.880 
palm roll like that I give it a palm
roll<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:10.580> then<00:04:10.700> that's<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.090> see<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.680> stays

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
roll and then that's it see and it stays

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.240 
roll and then that's it see and it stays
um<00:04:14.500> some<00:04:15.500> people<00:04:15.740> like<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.980> do<00:04:16.100> different

that and then dip this in to dip the end

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.270 
that and then dip this in to dip the end
into<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> like<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.570> hot<00:04:32.750> water<00:04:33.130> for<00:04:34.130> that
