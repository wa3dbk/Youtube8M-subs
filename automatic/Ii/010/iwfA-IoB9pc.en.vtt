00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
nice sculpture of your own the added

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
nice sculpture of your own the added
challenge<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> particular<00:00:54.629> sculpture

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
challenge in this particular sculpture

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.000 
challenge in this particular sculpture
is<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.160> legs<00:00:56.480> because<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:58.440> you've<00:00:58.649> seen<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
is the legs because if you've seen the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
is the legs because if you've seen the
previous<00:00:59.149> episodes<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.449> realize<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.320> there

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
previous episodes you realize that there

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460 
previous episodes you realize that there
is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> cardboard<00:01:02.730> pattern<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> inside<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is a cardboard pattern on the inside of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.210 
is a cardboard pattern on the inside of
these<00:01:04.619> sculptures

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
these sculptures

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.060 
these sculptures
based<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.270> patterns<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> book<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
based on patterns in the book so that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
based on patterns in the book so that
the<00:01:08.189> outline<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.720> legs<00:01:09.960> end<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> body

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the outline of the legs end of the body

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.640 
the outline of the legs end of the body
and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> head<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:12.360> before<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> ever

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and the head are all set before you ever

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
and the head are all set before you ever
begin<00:01:13.950> making<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> armature<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.689> because

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
begin making the armature but because

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
begin making the armature but because
the<00:01:16.200> legs<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.950> thin<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> narrow<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the legs are so thin and narrow the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
the legs are so thin and narrow the
cardboard<00:01:20.250> pattern<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:21.000> quite<00:01:21.330> flimsy

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
cardboard pattern is quite flimsy

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.830 
cardboard pattern is quite flimsy
so<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.040> order<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.850> produce<00:01:24.509> an

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so in order to actually produce an

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.280 
so in order to actually produce an
armature<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.619> strong<00:01:25.979> enough<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.290> so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
armature that's strong enough and so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.580 
armature that's strong enough and so
that<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> finished<00:01:29.210> sculpture<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.659> very

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that the finished sculpture will be very

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.660 
that the finished sculpture will be very
sturdy<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.340> strong<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.450> need<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.020> add<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
sturdy and strong you need to add some a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.890 
sturdy and strong you need to add some a
light<00:01:36.000> wire<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> inside<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.900> pattern

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
light wire on the inside of the pattern

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.160 
light wire on the inside of the pattern
and<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:42.150> add<00:01:43.009> some<00:01:44.009> crumpled<00:01:44.939> aluminum<00:01:45.810> foil

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and then add some crumpled aluminum foil

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.880 
and then add some crumpled aluminum foil
on<00:01:46.470> top<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.600> wind<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.560> very

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
on top of that and then wind it all very

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.539 
on top of that and then wind it all very
very<00:01:50.159> carefully<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:51.030> firmly<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:52.549> masking

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
very carefully very firmly with masking

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.060 
very carefully very firmly with masking
tape<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
tape and if you do this the the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.630 
tape and if you do this the the
cardboard<00:01:56.640> inside<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.750> wire<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.649> aluminum

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
cardboard inside the wire the aluminum

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.960 
cardboard inside the wire the aluminum
foil<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> mask

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
foil and the mask

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.910 
foil and the mask
we'll<00:02:01.330> all<00:02:01.540> create<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> really<00:02:02.500> strong

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
we'll all create a really strong

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.520 
we'll all create a really strong
armature<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:04.300> can<00:02:04.480> see<00:02:04.720> by<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.020> time<00:02:05.320> you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
armature as you can see by the time you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.609 
armature as you can see by the time you
put<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.980> pieces<00:02:06.220> together<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:08.110> actually

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
put the pieces together you actually

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.830 
put the pieces together you actually
have<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.070> an<00:02:09.490> armature<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.030> will<00:02:10.360> stand<00:02:10.570> up

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
have a an armature that will stand up

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.560 
have a an armature that will stand up
it's<00:02:11.110> very<00:02:11.410> straight<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.940> course<00:02:13.210> you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
it's very straight then of course you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.440 
it's very straight then of course you
Pat<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.200> with<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.770> newspaper<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.150> masking

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
Pat it with your newspaper and masking

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.630 
Pat it with your newspaper and masking
tape<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:17.950> fill<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
tape so that you actually fill out the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
tape so that you actually fill out the
form<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.330> fill<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.320> head<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
form you fill out the head of the the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.440 
form you fill out the head of the the
armature<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.580> same<00:02:24.790> way<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.300> did

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
armature in the same way that you did

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.200 
armature in the same way that you did
the<00:02:25.510> pig<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.590> course<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> face<00:02:27.460> old<00:02:27.760> facial

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
the pig of course the face old facial

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210 
the pig of course the face old facial
features<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.780> different<00:02:28.960> but<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.590> process
