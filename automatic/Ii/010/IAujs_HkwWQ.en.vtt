00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 I kinda shy Nde Fuji soldiers 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:16.830
 Well What is holding this fifth round Kobe tournament has been announced 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.630
 Well that it still was not in the industry until now or even in this special 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.470
 In conjunction with the 10th anniversary of Kobe Airport in Mashimaku ward 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 It is also good for us to have that base 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.970
 Very 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.560
 A band force 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:36.750
 I think I can not base 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'd heard held strange are also involved in the course layout of the design 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 Well that's why I haven't passed that qualifying before, but I'd like a supercross bridge 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.570
 Marlow 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.570
 The course is running all the time, so there are a lot of tips that are a little more specific. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 As a rider 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.930
 How is it seen that the course diagram was completed 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.630
 That's right 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.630
 Because the site is a little bigger than Super Cross, it is quite dynamic and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.870
 Draw a jump 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 Even if Mon Reiko customers look 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:19.570
 That jump to make it seem even if 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.300
 I have not been able to do it again because it has been designed 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.670
 Say there go to the absolute fun and I think by all means watch 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.360
 I thought that there were two such red jumps, but a bit overall 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.880
 Great 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 It has become a hard feeling 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 Well that 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 I thought so 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.440
 Because there are some dangerous parts when you make it full-scale 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 Also boost year 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300
 I think it's loose, but after all if you look at the general people 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.350
 Oh 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.090
 Really No. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.080
 I think it will be a jump to raise the woman up, so by all means 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.270
 I want to come to see the high-head jump 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.760
 I look forward to the force 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.170
 Kobe Convention Day 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.450
 Are you where you want to go when the tournament 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.790
 Well that Kobe North Zu' 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.870
 I'm certain that the waiting was not than not that it has entered a habit I 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.110
 Let's go fishing in the forest Chinese food 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 Hey 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:24.500
 Thank you for thinking that there is such a pleasure and it is a great pleasure 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.550
 Let's liven up together its fifth round Kobe tournament of the season also be included 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:35.090
 Finally, please give a message to the fans as a player chairman 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:41.500
 Masashi Chairman This is the fourth year of this year 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.660
 In the feeling that I want to boost up the industry in the meanwhile 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.480
 I'm doing 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 Because now, including that now echo rice tournament to 10 races per year some places even as the industry 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.760
 It's very good 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.410
 Yeah 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:02.160
 Work is also active at 4 manufacturers full 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:10.560
 It has become a very exciting industry, so I would like to go and see the public 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.370
 To see the run of British value on the water near people watching this TV 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.200
 Please come to 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.200
