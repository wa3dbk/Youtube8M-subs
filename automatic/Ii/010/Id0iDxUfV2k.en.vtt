00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
I got like a bunch hit marks heart with

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.810 
I got like a bunch hit marks heart with
me<00:02:11.780> hit<00:02:12.780> markers<00:02:13.230> while<00:02:13.530> trying<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
me hit markers while trying to get a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.390 
me hit markers while trying to get a
gameplay<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.739> because<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.770> don't<00:02:17.310> know

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
gameplay with this because I don't know

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.310 
gameplay with this because I don't know
why<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.060> flamethrower<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.750> takes<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.110> long

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
why the flamethrower just takes a long

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.070 
why the flamethrower just takes a long
ass<00:02:19.350> time<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.890> kill<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:21.870> way<00:02:22.020> to

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
ass time to kill and the only way to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.510 
ass time to kill and the only way to
kill<00:02:22.290> them<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.650> usually<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.100> catch<00:02:23.340> them

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
kill them is usually if you catch them

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.670 
kill them is usually if you catch them
way<00:02:23.760> off<00:02:23.970> guard<00:02:24.270> or<00:02:24.570> they're<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
way off guard or they're like just

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.120 
way off guard or they're like just
really<00:02:26.130> stupid<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.730> can't<00:02:26.760> aim<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:28.130> like

and the master key shotgun is a much
better<00:02:37.110> choice<00:02:37.410> because<00:02:38.420> well<00:02:39.420> actually<00:02:39.660> for

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
better choice because well actually for

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.810 
better choice because well actually for
one<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.500> were<00:02:40.799> filled<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.160> scavenger<00:02:41.790> I

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
and kill you that's another thing about

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.119

the<00:03:14.090> flamethrower<00:03:14.569> it's<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.840> lousy<00:03:15.170> range<00:03:15.739> I

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
the flamethrower it's got lousy range I

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.030 
the flamethrower it's got lousy range I
know<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.150> shotgun<00:03:17.690> does<00:03:17.900> too<00:03:18.200> but<00:03:18.410> at<00:03:18.769> least<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
know a shotgun does too but at least the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.410 
know a shotgun does too but at least the
shotgun<00:03:19.459> doesn't<00:03:19.700> have<00:03:19.790> counter<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.360> can

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
shotgun doesn't have counter you can

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.750 
shotgun doesn't have counter you can
just<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:21.560> usually<00:03:22.010> when<00:03:22.040> i<00:03:22.160> use<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> master

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
just like usually when i use the master

down<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.470> trigger<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:27.829> like<00:03:28.040> four<00:03:28.790> seconds

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
down the trigger for like four seconds

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990 
down the trigger for like four seconds
before<00:03:29.599> something<00:03:29.930> eyes<00:03:30.730> that's<00:03:31.730> another

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
before something eyes that's another

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.699 
before something eyes that's another
thing<00:03:32.299> when<00:03:32.540> you're<00:03:32.660> done<00:03:32.930> when<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.380> were<00:03:33.500> low

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
thing when you're done when you were low

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.250 
thing when you're done when you were low

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
you lose the entire canister so if let's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.860 
you lose the entire canister so if let's
say<00:03:36.349> yet<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:37.510> 69<00:03:40.090> circle<00:03:41.090> things<00:03:41.299> left<00:03:41.599> or

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
say yet like 69 circle things left or

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.979 
say yet like 69 circle things left or
ammo<00:03:42.560> flame<00:03:43.190> fuel<00:03:43.489> left<00:03:43.790> right<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.299> if<00:03:44.870> you

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
ammo flame fuel left right and if you

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.319 
ammo flame fuel left right and if you
were<00:03:45.110> loaded<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.590> moves<00:03:45.860> all<00:03:46.069> those<00:03:46.220> 69<00:03:46.730> fuels

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
were loaded you moves all those 69 fuels

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.990 
were loaded you moves all those 69 fuels
and<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.379> just<00:03:48.560> get<00:03:48.739> your<00:03:48.829> hundred<00:03:49.220> so

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
and you just get your hundred so

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.500 
and you just get your hundred so
basically<00:03:50.390> basically<00:03:50.930> can<00:03:51.349> only<00:03:51.500> reload<00:03:51.890> once

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
basically basically can only reload once

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.670 
basically basically can only reload once
a<00:03:53.680> life<00:03:54.680> until<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.549> run<00:03:55.670> out<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.910> think<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.680> the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
a life until you run out I think and the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.599 
a life until you run out I think and the
grenade<00:03:57.950> launcher<00:03:58.310> is<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.430> much<00:03:58.579> better

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
grenade launcher is a much better

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.910 
grenade launcher is a much better
attachment<00:03:59.569> choice<00:03:59.690> too<00:03:59.989> because<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.680> much

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
attachment choice too because it's much
