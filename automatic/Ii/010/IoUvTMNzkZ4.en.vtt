00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 what happens you see yourself and well here we are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.120
 in real team duel in the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.160
 fox map and the new fox map the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.679
 new dlc of eleven loud that good what 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 catch yesterday because I have the season pass and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 I have decided to download everything 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.480
 obviously the advantage in good and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.279
 Well I bring you this game because it is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.320
 my first game on the fire map 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.380
 that the truth is that nothing wrong the truth 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.300
 is that nothing is wrong in the good game 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 I'm going to bring you my own 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 opinions or impressions about what is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.469
 the df and well I want to say that for 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 example I've been testing then for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.610
 example 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 the bayview map was testing me 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.300
 start I've been testing containment and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 The truth is that they are maps that are 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.420
 I am enjoying it very much have liked enough and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.540
 they are pretty good already since some do not 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.970
 they are so big 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.400
 as they thought some seemed like they were 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.660
 very large but others not then by 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.720
 example this and the ignition map that 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.150
 is the exact copy of one of the maps 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.150
 of modern warfare 2 the truth that is 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 very well and they are smaller and let's say 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.510
 that recovers a bit the essence of call 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.820
 of duty is not at least the impression 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.760
 that gives me, we do not have to have 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.430
 another option similar straits or not well 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.870
 On the other hand, I've been testing how 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.180
 you can see in the gameplay the maverick 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.290
 which is what I'm wearing with a point look 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.610
 red and I think I carry it with chargers 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.780
 extended 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.220
 Well I do not do not carry chargers 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.000
 I think extended think I carry with 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.540
 grip and look red dot and something 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 better then, honestly, it seems to me 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.430
 what 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.920
 what is a soul is quite good 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.200
 pointing with it with point plate 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.150
 red goes very well 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.130
 I did not expect it to be also me 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.080
 I thought I was going to make a chestnut but 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.930
 the truth that is very good very well 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 very well you do not know how you should go 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.000
 so to speak, an equipillo the maverick 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 rifle rifle the truth that I bring this 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.860
 gameplay pge especially because also 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.959
 this mother is a prankster and that the truth 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.720
 just so that I saw it jce no and in addition 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.640
 caught the madrid without a peephole 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.780
 Osen points out maverick in three ways 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.310
 different in the same train so 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 then in this in this that for example 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.030
 while I got the pilot from the ico but 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.430
 they do not kill me anymore they just killed me 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.959
 twice and they do not kill me anymore 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 in the gameplay and the truth that I make a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.030
 gameplay quite interesting and pretty 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.380
 well you can say not the love see and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.690
 I think I prefer to carry 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.520
 with the silencer simply stops 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.250
 if we want to take a run so that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.260
 to see me less and such but the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.360
 truth is that the weapon for example when 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.630
 we do not put him muffler he has a 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.320
 flash pretty base of curious me 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 remember a bit then other weapons but 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.130
 The truth is that they have pretty forms 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.780
 incredible and here where I go 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.460
 asking around so you know that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 is the normally respaired where 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.890
 they reappear or there in the background 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.400
 it is usually the respawn of them 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.990
 then many times when we entered 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.770
 this house and we see that there is no one if 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.440
 we look to the left normally 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.240
 always or almost always can enter you 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.400
 one by the door of the staircase and 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.530
 It is usually that that is usually what 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.940
 Andes planned there not the guys to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.010
 Special advice, careful when you enter 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.900
 in the house is because if there is nobody 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.930
 in the top part that's weird because 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.530
 there are balls of the balls the truth is that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.270
 it goes very well in one tried to be michael 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.340
 myers but it did not come out 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.620
 take a lot of packages but I do not 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.300
 played especially michael myers or 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.850
 it has touched me everything it touches me or sack 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.040
 it's my turn to have a lock and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.990
 ocean's has touched everything except less 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.820
 what is michael myers is not that I do not know 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.190
 if he will be willing, he will say no, do not take him out 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.140
 youtube or that people friends but 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.390
 is that I do not know I do not know why and good here 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.310
 as you can see a situation I did not have 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.500
 nothing and I say good first charge from 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.810
 down I know there's one up 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.600
 perfectly what happens I prefer 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.290
 turn it around and now there's one of the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.450
 team that seems to be catching on 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.310
 michael myers and as you can see in the 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.950
 gameplay was heard a kind of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.820
 pretty gloomy song in plan 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.270
 fear and such in which the song then is 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.270
 a song like that a little tricky over there and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.700
 when we say may bayern 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.040
 it's just like a song about 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.310
 children singing or something like that 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.680
 so a little more angelic or something like that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.030
 true that is quite curious and this 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.860
 this tlc seems to me a good one of the axis not 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.590
 this map in particular because I like me 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.730
 I really like it and well I do not know what 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.890
 it will look like you 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.530
 the truth is that I am very happy with 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.800
 the tlc I even like more I like 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.450
 much more these maps than maps 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.060
 conventional that this call has 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.680
 of duty and well here I say goodbye 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.330
 because the helicopter pilot is going to 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.940
 take out but they do not let me be marked for the 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.320
 heading so like in favorites has 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.990
 liked the video subscribe for 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.330
 much more and most importantly we 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.330
 we will see in the next video until soon
