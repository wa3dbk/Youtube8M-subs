00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.310 
the first time we have an intelligent
ABS<00:03:16.860> system<00:03:17.310> which<00:03:18.030> means<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.110> can

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
ABS system which means that it it can

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.020 
ABS system which means that it it can
work<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.769> what<00:03:20.040> sort<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.250> surface<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
work out what sort of surface the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.790 
work out what sort of surface the
vehicle<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.450> driving<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.170> adjust<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.680> way

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
vehicle is driving on and adjust the way

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.890 
vehicle is driving on and adjust the way
the<00:03:22.950> ABS<00:03:23.250> system<00:03:23.400> works<00:03:24.060> accordingly<00:03:24.600> and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the ABS system works accordingly and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.040 
the ABS system works accordingly and
also<00:03:25.970> there's<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.030> differential<00:03:27.540> lock<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
also there's a differential lock on this

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.560 
also there's a differential lock on this
vehicle<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:28.980> means<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.940> drive<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
vehicle which means it can drive out of

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.390 
vehicle which means it can drive out of
sticky<00:03:30.959> situations<00:03:31.140> more<00:03:31.709> easily<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
sticky situations more easily and the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.650 
sticky situations more easily and the
ABS<00:03:32.640> even<00:03:32.940> works<00:03:33.120> with<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.450> which<00:03:33.630> is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ABS even works with that which is

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.600 
ABS even works with that which is
excellent<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.380> we've<00:03:34.500> enough<00:03:34.739> Road<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.370> still

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
excellent so we've enough Road you still

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.370 
excellent so we've enough Road you still
have<00:03:35.760> extra<00:03:36.120> help<00:03:36.540> that's<00:03:36.750> right<00:03:37.019> you're<00:03:37.290> not

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
have extra help that's right you're not

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.650 
have extra help that's right you're not
going<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.680> wheel<00:03:37.890> lock<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:39.330> other<00:03:39.420> thing

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
going to get wheel lock the other thing

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
going to get wheel lock the other thing
we<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.260> detachable<00:03:40.920> stabilizer<00:03:41.730> bar

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
we have is a detachable stabilizer bar

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.780 
we have is a detachable stabilizer bar
at<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.300> back<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.920> now<00:03:43.920> what<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.280> does<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.670> it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
at the back and now what this does is it

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.490 
at the back and now what this does is it
gives<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.209> very<00:03:45.450> stable<00:03:45.810> on-road

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
gives you very stable on-road

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.490 
gives you very stable on-road
performance<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.670> reduces<00:03:48.120> body<00:03:48.300> roll<00:03:48.630> but

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
performance so it reduces body roll but

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.680 
performance so it reduces body roll but
off<00:03:49.769> road<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.519> can<00:03:50.670> detach<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.000> stabilizer

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
off road you can detach that stabilizer

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.750 
off road you can detach that stabilizer
bar<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.200> get<00:03:52.320> much<00:03:52.560> more<00:03:52.799> axle<00:03:53.549> articulation

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
bar and get much more axle articulation

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.380 
bar and get much more axle articulation
and<00:03:54.540> much<00:03:55.470> more<00:03:55.709> traction<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.400> more<00:03:57.000> comfort

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
and much more traction and more comfort

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.810 
and much more traction and more comfort
inside<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.780> vehicle<00:03:58.310> we<00:03:59.310> acknowledge<00:03:59.790> that

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
inside the vehicle we acknowledge that

suspect<00:04:19.709> vehicles<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.340> yeah<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:20.880> think<00:04:21.030> to

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
suspect vehicles so yeah we think to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.450 
suspect vehicles so yeah we think to
drive<00:04:21.720> on<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.109> road<00:04:22.289> or<00:04:22.470> every<00:04:22.740> day<00:04:22.919> it's<00:04:23.400> a

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
drive on the road or every day it's a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.409 
drive on the road or every day it's a
very<00:04:23.490> usable<00:04:23.850> vehicle<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:26.039> 4x4<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.940> 90's

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419
