 percent nothing to say that we want to think acceleration to the video with the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 full faces do not take the word literally 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.670
 this promises nothing simply that we have thought to law 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.240
 maybe we do it 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.960
 percent we will also celebrate it weighs also an inter disaster responding 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.200

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
 anything can happen efe 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.410
 the game with said or whatever percent 1-4 content 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.100
 with this defeat you already know that within the little day 20 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.890
 telcel madrid-barsa there good percent I like football and I do not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.109
 like people depends on what day 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.430
 I hope as you know from the sun of madrid the leader of the astana 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 and we're not going to give it a lay 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.390
 p a good goal 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 p written below in the comments section 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.980
 on how you think it's equivalent to the match 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.740
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 I'm going to tell you 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.510
 I do not know the detective 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.980
 It's difficult because she knows everyone that he's going to be better 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.830
 sell it 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.080
 realistic to say good to old harleem 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 p the madrid won for one min 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.470
 worse this time should comment on low costs that will remain 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.200
 obviously 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.939
 I think there are going to be a lot of those technicians out there 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.090
 the process because I'm going to rest but the fact that these will also have to 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.279
 contribute our center in our favor 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.819
 Now that he has finished telling all the topics he wanted to talk about 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.609
 European to remember that the teques efe 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.220
 we are doing bear misha live 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.110
 we are starting we are pleased with quality and digital sound 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.260
 ep but 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.219
 it no longer occurs and transmits people like it when we get to have about 350 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.800
 Effective at the same time 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.669
 that if the press says it's a lot of stress a lot 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.399
 the future is a video 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:46.539
 percent then a child 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.489
 people get full 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.979
 i 3 can get to have 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.979
 efe identified at the same time 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.890
 ii in the distribution while 50 of okondo I was watching 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.359
 min and still 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.059
 and well, of course, that's like an hour in a row 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.799
 what christ 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.499
 so if any user can do is to thank him for being 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.269
 there and good 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.629
 and it is that it has not been processed and its first specifies that request of course 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.639
 will 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.609
 the extreme 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.659
 nothing when responding live 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
 Puno cusco altiplano armed but will do when you are because you know how 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.239
 answer someone over to take something 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.069
