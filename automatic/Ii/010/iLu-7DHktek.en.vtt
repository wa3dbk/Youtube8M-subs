were<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.150> I'm<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:34.930> I'm<00:03:35.110> kind<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.410> confused

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
were on it I'm like I'm kind of confused

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.020 
were on it I'm like I'm kind of confused
because<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.130> was<00:03:36.250> really<00:03:36.520> really<00:03:36.640> good<00:03:36.760> but

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
because it was really really good but

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.790 
because it was really really good but
then<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.270> was<00:03:37.360> sort<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.840> think<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.650> need<00:03:38.739> to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
then it was sort of I think you need to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.350 
then it was sort of I think you need to
put<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> little<00:03:39.130> more<00:03:39.280> content<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.880> your<00:03:39.910> dances

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
put a little more content in your dances

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.270 
put a little more content in your dances
like<00:03:40.840> everything<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.560> did<00:03:41.739> was<00:03:41.950> fun<00:03:42.160> and
