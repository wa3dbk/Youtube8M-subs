00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.950
 sylvie thank you I seriously prefer I 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.000
 would prefer Sylvie Sylvie listen to me 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 put me right now please in 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.190
 the cat the number of hours you have 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.190
 done with your car school 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 excuse me it's true that on camera 45 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.290
 sylvie hours and you still do not arrive 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 not to look around you or to te 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.350
 then direct the roundabouts the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350
 panels etc 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 there are sometimes brakes to the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.409
 progression 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 and when I talk about progression it's 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.549
 not progress in training 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.850
 this is the progression the path on 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.850
 the road 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.799
 if you start by apprehending to have 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.580
 afraid of an indication of information 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.840
 that you perceive to know a roundabout you 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.479
 get to see a roundabout and you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 start asking you questions 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.270
 naturally it does not leave time 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.049
 to your mind to take the good 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.570
 decisions it is imperative that the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.250
 theory be clear then not only 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 must whatsoever but clear 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.330
 in addition to that they have to be 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.440
 treated because often people me 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 say here I know what to do 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.530
 but I can not do it I know what he 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.240
 must do but I can not do it but 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.940
 it means a priori that it's not 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 specially assimilated the simulation 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.440
 it's the fact that our brain is in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 able to order something 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.040
 in a relatively short period of time 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 without needing to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:00.330
 think there are some exercises that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 I do with my students so who 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.690
 is to ensure that their 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 looks are projecting further because 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.400
 that as apprentice drivers or 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.790
 in any case drivers in training 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.190
 because that's the exact title you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.340
 tend to look very very very 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.349
 very very very very very close to you at 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 manage your immediate environment 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.590
 and then as and when 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.939
 training you had to find that your 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.489
 look start to wear a little 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.659
 little further me I think it's a 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.280
 civil observation problem 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.500
 I think it's a problem 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.540
 observational 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.770
 you'll have to make sure 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 look further for that I'm in 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.640
 make a short video 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.370
 I have all my stuff here I made this 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.810
 video today to be quite 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.820
 honest i made this video 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.190
 today but I would be happy 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:02.330
 sylvie as a faithful listener of the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.800
 blog to the limit you will kill me send me 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.280
 your phone number and I will pass you 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.280
 a little phone call
