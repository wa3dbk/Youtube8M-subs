turbine it's really easy all three

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.120 
turbine it's really easy all three
pieces<00:00:43.720> are<00:00:43.990> always<00:00:44.170> in<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.380> same<00:00:44.530> spot

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
and use it to get out of it if you put

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.540 
and use it to get out of it if you put
it<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:53.650> corner<00:00:54.010> you'll<00:00:54.190> be<00:00:54.280> able<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.520> open

on<00:01:12.999> and<00:01:13.210> having<00:01:13.329> to<00:01:13.479> open<00:01:13.749> them<00:01:13.869> just<00:01:14.499> in<00:01:14.649> case

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
on and having to open them just in case

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.169 
on and having to open them just in case
it's<00:01:15.039> middles<00:01:15.310> around<00:01:15.549> or<00:01:15.700> something<00:01:15.999> a<00:01:16.090> lot

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
it's middles around or something a lot

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.279 
it's middles around or something a lot
of<00:01:16.299> people<00:01:16.479> have<00:01:16.600> been<00:01:16.689> trying<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:16.960> put<00:01:17.109> it<00:01:17.200> in

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
of people have been trying to put it in

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.599 
of people have been trying to put it in
front<00:01:17.469> of<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.679> but<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.069> definitely<00:01:18.310> not

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
front of that but it's definitely not

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.059 
front of that but it's definitely not
there<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.210> step<00:01:19.539> three<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.079> turn<00:01:20.859> on<00:01:21.009> the

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
there so step three is to turn on the

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.149 
there so step three is to turn on the
power<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:22.450> this<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.840> relatively<00:01:23.709> easy<00:01:23.829> as

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
power now this is relatively easy as

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.789 
power now this is relatively easy as
well<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.609> pieces<00:01:24.939> do<00:01:25.149> move<00:01:25.420> around<00:01:25.799> but

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
well the pieces do move around but

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.559 
well the pieces do move around but
they're<00:01:27.069> they're<00:01:27.490> always<00:01:27.850> close<00:01:28.209> by<00:01:28.389> and

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
they're they're always close by and

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.260 
they're they're always close by and
they're<00:01:28.719> always<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.289> white<00:01:29.560> area<00:01:30.209> so<00:01:31.209> you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
they're always in this white area so you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.059 
they're always in this white area so you
get<00:01:31.569> all<00:01:31.689> those<00:01:31.780> pieces<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.469> put<00:01:32.829> your<00:01:32.920> two

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
get all those pieces and put your two

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.590 
get all those pieces and put your two
writing<00:01:33.280> together<00:01:33.399> or<00:01:33.729> put<00:01:33.850> your<00:01:34.030> power

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
writing together or put your power

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.239 
writing together or put your power
together<00:01:34.869> now<00:01:35.530> notice<00:01:35.859> that<00:01:35.889> I'm<00:01:36.219> just

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.569 
keeping one guy with me the whole time
and<00:01:38.079> he's<00:01:38.200> not<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.439> crawler<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.279> the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
and he's not a crawler because the

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.519 
and he's not a crawler because the
crawlers<00:01:39.939> will<00:01:39.969> the<00:01:40.689> crawler<00:01:40.959> seem<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.289> die<00:01:41.499> a

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
crawlers will the crawler seem to die a

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.999 
crawlers will the crawler seem to die a
lot<00:01:41.799> in<00:01:42.399> fog<00:01:42.700> or<00:01:43.179> if<00:01:43.959> they<00:01:44.529> get<00:01:44.679> hit<00:01:44.859> by<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
lot in fog or if they get hit by the

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.669 
lot in fog or if they get hit by the
power<00:01:45.279> they<00:01:45.520> die<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.109> and<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:47.319> forth<00:01:47.529> so

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
power they die and so on and so forth so

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:48.929 
power they die and so on and so forth so
you're<00:01:47.799> gonna<00:01:47.889> want<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.219> run<00:01:48.429> this<00:01:48.549> guy<00:01:48.729> around

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
you're gonna want to run this guy around

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.279 
you're gonna want to run this guy around
for<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.179> little<00:01:49.270> bit<00:01:49.420> while<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.810> power<00:01:49.959> turns

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
for a little bit while the power turns

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.660 
for a little bit while the power turns
on<00:01:50.499> it<00:01:50.649> takes<00:01:50.829> around<00:01:51.039> 15<00:01:51.549> seconds<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.369> reason

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
on it takes around 15 seconds the reason

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.010 
on it takes around 15 seconds the reason
you<00:01:54.759> need<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.999> wait<00:01:55.179> here<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.599> because<00:01:55.899> that

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
you need to wait here is because that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.260 
you need to wait here is because that
door<00:01:56.259> doesn't<00:01:56.409> open<00:01:56.679> yet<00:01:57.069> until<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.999> power<00:01:58.179> is

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
door doesn't open yet until the power is

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.940 
door doesn't open yet until the power is
fully<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:59.020> step<00:01:59.289> 4<00:01:59.469> is<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.619> place<00:01:59.920> your

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
fully on so step 4 is to place your

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.499 
fully on so step 4 is to place your
turbine<00:02:00.399> now<00:02:00.729> make<00:02:00.909> sure<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.329> guy<00:02:01.450> is

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
turbine now make sure that the guy is

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.999 
turbine now make sure that the guy is
running<00:02:01.840> behind<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:02.229> because<00:02:02.409> if<00:02:02.649> he<00:02:02.770> drops

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
running behind you because if he drops

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.620 
running behind you because if he drops
down<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.369> hole<00:02:03.609> he's<00:02:03.880> gonna<00:02:04.060> knock<00:02:04.299> out<00:02:04.479> your

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
down that hole he's gonna knock out your

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.539 
down that hole he's gonna knock out your
turbine<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.289> this<00:02:05.529> whole<00:02:05.770> thing<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.189> gonna<00:02:06.429> be

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
turbine and this whole thing is gonna be

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.100 
turbine and this whole thing is gonna be
pointless<00:02:06.819> you're<00:02:07.209> gonna<00:02:07.299> have<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.599> do<00:02:07.719> all

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
pointless you're gonna have to do all

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.779 
pointless you're gonna have to do all
these<00:02:08.319> steps<00:02:08.500> again<00:02:08.800> you're<00:02:09.459> gonna<00:02:09.550> wanna

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
these steps again you're gonna wanna

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.240 
these steps again you're gonna wanna
lead<00:02:10.090> him<00:02:10.209> outside<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.959> him<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> bus

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
lead him outside get him on the bus

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.250 
lead him outside get him on the bus
or<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> want<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.720> run<00:02:13.930> all

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
or if you want you know you can run all

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.540 
or if you want you know you can run all
the<00:02:14.410> way<00:02:14.470> through<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.740> fog<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.280> need<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
the way through the fog but you need to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.640 
the way through the fog but you need to
stand<00:02:15.760> close<00:02:16.450> enough<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.900> him<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.320> he's<00:02:17.500> not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
stand close enough to him that he's not

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.920 
stand close enough to him that he's not
gonna<00:02:17.830> die<00:02:18.100> behind<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.570> can<00:02:19.720> still

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
gonna die behind you and you can still

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.450 
gonna die behind you and you can still
see<00:02:20.110> him<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> did<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.130> just<00:02:21.160> kept

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
see him so what I did was I just kept

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.920 
see him so what I did was I just kept
him<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.670> bus<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.330> see<00:02:22.540> actually

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
him on the bus and you can see actually

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.990 
him on the bus and you can see actually
when<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:23.590> dodged<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.250> side<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.880> can

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
when they dodged to one side so you can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.180 
when they dodged to one side so you can
just<00:02:25.090> dica<00:02:25.420> round<00:02:25.630> them<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:26.800> relatively

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
just dica round them and it's relatively

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.640 
just dica round them and it's relatively
easy<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.730> long<00:02:27.910> as<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.120> only<00:02:28.240> have<00:02:28.420> one<00:02:28.750> guy

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.960 

you're<00:02:35.650> gonna<00:02:35.740> lead<00:02:35.920> your<00:02:36.040> guy<00:02:36.160> down<00:02:36.459> I'm

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you're gonna lead your guy down I'm

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.920 
you're gonna lead your guy down I'm
gonna<00:02:37.090> take<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> little<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.660> money<00:02:37.750> out<00:02:37.840> of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
gonna take a little bit of money out of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.660 
gonna take a little bit of money out of
my<00:02:38.080> bank<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> pocket

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
my bank here just so I got the pocket

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.110 
my bank here just so I got the pocket
punch<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:40.240> notice<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.410> open<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.700> step<00:02:42.910> 5

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
punch now notice this is open so step 5

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
punch now notice this is open so step 5
final<00:02:43.750> step<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> assemble<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.890> pac-man

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
final step is to assemble the pac-man

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.250 
final step is to assemble the pac-man
machine<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.910> it's<00:02:46.060> relatively<00:02:46.600> easy<00:02:46.870> as<00:02:47.080> well

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
machine so it's relatively easy as well

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.380 
machine so it's relatively easy as well
all<00:02:47.860> pieces<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.610> spot<00:02:48.850> they<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.120> move

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
all pieces are in the spot they do move

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.729 
all pieces are in the spot they do move
around<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.790> takes<00:02:51.970> maybe<00:02:52.900> 20<00:02:53.080> seconds<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
around but it takes maybe 20 seconds to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.990 
around but it takes maybe 20 seconds to
find<00:02:53.980> all<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.190> them<00:02:54.400> they're<00:02:54.550> just<00:02:54.760> in<00:02:54.850> between

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
find all of them they're just in between

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.060 
find all of them they're just in between
the<00:02:55.239> cages<00:02:55.660> somewhere<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.320> top<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.650> boxes

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
the cages somewhere on top of the boxes

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.310 
the cages somewhere on top of the boxes
it<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.940> includes<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.420> table<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> battery

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
it just includes the table the battery

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.270 
it just includes the table the battery
and<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.890> actual<00:03:00.190> pack<00:03:00.459> punch<00:03:00.760> shell<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:06.070> here

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and the actual pack punch shell so here

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.680 
and the actual pack punch shell so here
we<00:03:06.370> go<00:03:06.489> we've<00:03:06.670> got<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.940> pack<00:03:07.120> punch<00:03:07.450> machine

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
we go we've got the pack punch machine

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650 
we go we've got the pack punch machine
together<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.430> I'm<00:03:09.580> just<00:03:09.700> gonna<00:03:09.790> put<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> mp5

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
together and I'm just gonna put the mp5

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.320 
together and I'm just gonna put the mp5
in<00:03:10.900> there<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.530> for<00:03:11.950> an<00:03:12.040> example<00:03:12.550> and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
in there just for for an example and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.620 
in there just for for an example and
actually<00:03:14.020> what's<00:03:14.709> kind<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.070> neat<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:16.120> you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
actually what's kind of neat is that you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
the executioner pack-a-punch and if you

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.529 
the executioner pack-a-punch and if you
notice<00:04:19.859> I'm<00:04:19.949> using<00:04:20.009> all<00:04:20.310> these<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.639> round<00:04:20.849> 2021

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
notice I'm using all these on round 2021

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.510 
notice I'm using all these on round 2021
and<00:04:21.780> look<00:04:22.229> how<00:04:22.319> fast<00:04:22.530> I'm<00:04:22.740> reloading<00:04:23.069> and<00:04:23.340> if

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
and look how fast I'm reloading and if

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.580 
and look how fast I'm reloading and if
you<00:04:23.610> use<00:04:23.789> double<00:04:24.120> tap<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.900> splits<00:04:25.169> each<00:04:25.319> bullet

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
you use double tap it splits each bullet

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.409 
you use double tap it splits each bullet
into<00:04:25.919> two<00:04:26.129> so<00:04:26.400> you're<00:04:26.550> doing<00:04:26.789> double<00:04:27.060> damage

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
into two so you're doing double damage

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.390 
into two so you're doing double damage
so<00:04:27.690> double<00:04:28.530> tap<00:04:28.680> does<00:04:28.860> something<00:04:29.129> a<00:04:29.190> little

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
so double tap does something a little

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.670 
so double tap does something a little
different<00:04:29.699> than<00:04:29.819> before<00:04:30.470> anyways<00:04:31.470> guys

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
different than before anyways guys
