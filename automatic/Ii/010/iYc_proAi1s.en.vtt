just<00:01:31.380> never<00:01:31.619> happened<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.240> not

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
just never happened so far we have not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
just never happened so far we have not
found<00:01:33.659> anything<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.439> could<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
found anything that could do that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
found anything that could do that
I<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.610> use<00:01:35.880> some<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.299> simple<00:01:36.570> technique

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I just use some really simple technique

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
I just use some really simple technique
and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.189> thought<00:01:38.280> I'd<00:01:38.400> explain<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and I just thought I'd explain to you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460 
and I just thought I'd explain to you
guys<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.479> done<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> guys<00:01:40.290> we

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
guys what I done because you guys we

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
guys what I done because you guys we
really<00:01:40.740> wanted<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.210> me

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
really wanted to see it well what to me

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
really wanted to see it well what to me
may<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:42.930> necessarily<00:01:43.170> work<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> as

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
may not necessarily work for you as

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.819 
may not necessarily work for you as
quickly<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:44.939> efficiently<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.680> may

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
quickly or as efficiently and it may

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
quickly or as efficiently and it may
work<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.640> may<00:01:47.820> help<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
work a little bit may help out but it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
work a little bit may help out but it
might<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:49.110> work<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.310> me

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
might not work as well as it did for me

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
might not work as well as it did for me
because<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.540> own<00:01:51.810> growth<00:01:52.290> cycle

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
because we all have our own growth cycle

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
because we all have our own growth cycle
something<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.970> works<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.360> me<00:01:54.509> may<00:01:54.750> have

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
something that works for me may have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
something that works for me may have
been<00:01:55.020> much<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.530> rapid<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> quicker<00:01:56.399> than<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
been much more rapid and quicker than it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
been much more rapid and quicker than it
would<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> used<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> first<00:01:58.020> tip<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.590> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
would be used so the first tip I have

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.450 
would be used so the first tip I have
for<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.659> all<00:02:00.840> too

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
to prevent yourself from being tempted

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.690 
to prevent yourself from being tempted

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
to prevent them from looking more

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.060 
to prevent them from looking more
obvious<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.660> are<00:02:50.840> things<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.350> do<00:02:51.530> but

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
obvious there are things you can do but

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.610 
obvious there are things you can do but
the<00:02:52.160> best<00:02:52.340> thing<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.510> try<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.170> leave<00:02:54.380> them

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the best thing is to try and leave them

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.520 
unblocked especially they have follicles
where<00:04:20.269> they're<00:04:20.449> all<00:04:20.570> kind<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.900> blocked<00:04:21.229> and

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
where they're all kind of blocked and

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.320 
where they're all kind of blocked and
that<00:04:21.889> will<00:04:22.010> just<00:04:22.160> promote<00:04:22.490> hair<00:04:22.729> growth<00:04:22.760> even

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
that will just promote hair growth even

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.939 
that will just promote hair growth even
more<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.169> really<00:04:24.350> helped<00:04:24.680> for<00:04:24.800> me<00:04:24.919> I

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
more so that really helped for me I

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.860 
more so that really helped for me I
noticed<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:26.000> big<00:04:26.180> difference<00:04:26.510> when<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:26.690> was

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
noticed a big difference when I was

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.990 
noticed a big difference when I was
doing<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.289> when<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.680> first<00:04:28.190> wanted<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.789> start

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
doing that when I first wanted to start

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.820 
doing that when I first wanted to start
growing<00:04:29.180> out<00:04:29.360> my<00:04:29.389> eyebrows<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:30.260> before

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
growing out my eyebrows just before

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.320 
growing out my eyebrows just before
about<00:04:31.010> two<00:04:31.190> months<00:04:31.430> ago<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.639> asked<00:04:32.180> my

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
about two months ago I asked my

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.090 
about two months ago I asked my
followers<00:04:32.539> on<00:04:32.900> Instagram<00:04:33.350> what<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> should<00:04:33.919> do

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
followers on Instagram what I should do

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.070 
followers on Instagram what I should do
and<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.610> couple<00:04:34.789> of<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.060> guys<00:04:35.090> were<00:04:35.539> saying<00:04:35.780> she

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
and a couple of you guys were saying she

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.279 
and a couple of you guys were saying she
use<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.470> clear<00:04:37.220> mascara<00:04:37.610> wand<00:04:38.120> or<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.419> spoolie<00:04:39.139> or

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
use a clear mascara wand or a spoolie or

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.260 
use a clear mascara wand or a spoolie or
something<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:40.220> apply<00:04:40.849> coconut

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
something like that and apply coconut

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.330 
something like that and apply coconut
oil<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.080> think<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.380> was<00:04:42.470> another<00:04:42.770> oil<00:04:43.010> on

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
oil and I think it was another oil on

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.920 
oil and I think it was another oil on
Tibet<00:04:43.580> cotton<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.090> exactly<00:04:44.479> what<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.720> was

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
Tibet cotton but exactly what it was

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.749 
Tibet cotton but exactly what it was
we're<00:04:45.199> just<00:04:45.320> saying<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.590> apply<00:04:45.830> oils<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.550> to

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
we're just saying to apply oils and to

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.040 
we're just saying to apply oils and to
brush<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.120> through<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.389> brows<00:04:47.599> and<00:04:47.900> that

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
brush it through the brows and that

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.570 
brush it through the brows and that
would<00:04:48.199> promote<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> hair<00:04:48.740> growth<00:04:48.949> so<00:04:49.460> it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
would promote the hair growth so it

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.860 
would promote the hair growth so it
definitely<00:04:49.729> gave<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.240> try<00:04:50.419> throughout<00:04:50.780> the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
definitely gave it a try throughout the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.689 
definitely gave it a try throughout the
beginning<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.440> me<00:04:51.830> growing<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.280> my<00:04:52.340> eyebrows

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
beginning of me growing up my eyebrows

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.430 
beginning of me growing up my eyebrows
the<00:04:52.970> first<00:04:53.180> month<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.720> started<00:04:53.780> doing<00:04:54.320> that

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
the first month I started doing that

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.129 
the first month I started doing that
ended<00:04:55.190> up<00:04:55.310> using<00:04:55.460> coconut<00:04:55.849> oil<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.510> argan<00:04:56.930> oil

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
ended up using coconut oil and argan oil

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.200 
ended up using coconut oil and argan oil
and<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.949> was<00:04:58.099> just<00:04:58.310> kind<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.580> making<00:04:58.789> my<00:04:58.970> hair

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
and that was just kind of making my hair

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.420 
and that was just kind of making my hair
really<00:04:59.510> nice<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.900> thick<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.320> would<00:05:00.590> apply<00:05:00.889> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
really nice and thick I would apply the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.219 
really nice and thick I would apply the
coconut<00:05:01.820> oil<00:05:01.910> onto<00:05:02.210> my<00:05:02.449> eyebrows<00:05:02.750> before<00:05:03.169> I

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229

itself
they're<00:05:08.000> like<00:05:08.120> thin<00:05:08.630> hairs<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.229> they<00:05:09.289> feel

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
they're like thin hairs that they feel

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.379 
they're like thin hairs that they feel
thin<00:05:10.039> whereas<00:05:10.400> obviously<00:05:10.580> some<00:05:11.030> people's

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
thin whereas obviously some people's

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.029 
thin whereas obviously some people's
hair<00:05:11.570> they<00:05:11.750> do<00:05:11.960> feel<00:05:12.199> thick<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.770> coarse

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
hair they do feel thick and coarse

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.980 
hair they do feel thick and coarse
whereas<00:05:13.820> my<00:05:13.940> eyebrows<00:05:14.300> are<00:05:14.510> not<00:05:14.750> like<00:05:14.960> that

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
whereas my eyebrows are not like that

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.350 
whereas my eyebrows are not like that
they<00:05:15.409> don't<00:05:15.650> have<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.889> natural<00:05:16.490> texture<00:05:17.060> of

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
they don't have a natural texture of

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.589 
they don't have a natural texture of
food<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.139> thick<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.400> did<00:05:19.669> feel<00:05:20.030> them<00:05:20.360> start

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
food and thick so I did feel them start

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.270 
food and thick so I did feel them start
to<00:05:20.659> feel<00:05:20.930> thicker<00:05:21.229> when<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.650> started<00:05:21.979> doing

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
to feel thicker when I started doing

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.520 
to feel thicker when I started doing
this<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:22.699> does<00:05:22.940> improve<00:05:23.419> thickness<00:05:24.020> when

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
this and it does improve thickness when

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.960 
this and it does improve thickness when
they<00:05:24.650> feel<00:05:24.830> thick<00:05:24.979> obviously<00:05:25.460> they<00:05:25.610> start<00:05:25.880> to

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
they feel thick obviously they start to

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.000

help I think it was called liberal or
something<00:05:35.270> like<00:05:35.419> that<00:05:35.479> but<00:05:36.229> I<00:05:36.260> didn't<00:05:36.470> end<00:05:36.560> up

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
something like that but I didn't end up

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.589 
something like that but I didn't end up
using<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.039> but<00:05:37.490> just<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:37.760> main<00:05:37.970> thing<00:05:38.000> how

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
using that but just the main thing how

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.920 
using that but just the main thing how
all<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.139> this<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:40.430> just<00:05:40.639> let<00:05:40.970> them<00:05:41.210> grow<00:05:41.659> but

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
all of this is to just let them grow but

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.689 
all of this is to just let them grow but
let<00:05:42.110> them<00:05:42.260> grow<00:05:42.530> into<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.130> natural<00:05:43.520> shape

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
let them grow into the natural shape

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.870 
let them grow into the natural shape
obviously<00:05:44.479> you<00:05:44.630> can<00:05:44.900> remove<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.349> tiny

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
obviously you can remove the tiny

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.540 
obviously you can remove the tiny
but<00:05:47.240> nothing<00:05:47.720> too<00:05:48.650> drastic<00:05:48.889> didn't<00:05:49.490> I

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
my eyebrows unfortunately at the moment

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.570

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
like that but I just found that being

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.879 
like that but I just found that being
consistent<00:06:18.050> with<00:06:18.080> their<00:06:18.319> just<00:06:18.590> doing<00:06:18.800> the

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
consistent with their just doing the

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.680 
consistent with their just doing the
same<00:06:19.099> thing<00:06:19.159> over<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:19.819> over<00:06:19.940> again<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.569> I

disciplined<00:06:23.120> try<00:06:23.690> and<00:06:24.050> forget<00:06:24.560> about<00:06:24.710> the

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
disciplined try and forget about the
