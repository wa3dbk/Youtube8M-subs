00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
payment tolerance because he basically

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.599 
payment tolerance because he basically
gives<00:01:49.749> us<00:01:49.869> feedback<00:01:50.079> and<00:01:51.039> we<00:01:51.069> trust<00:01:51.399> him

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
gives us feedback and we trust him

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.340

because<00:01:51.789> we<00:01:52.030> know<00:01:52.179> his<00:01:52.359> training<00:01:52.659> ethnic<00:01:53.049> work

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
because we know his training ethnic work

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.260 
because we know his training ethnic work
ethic<00:01:53.710> over<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.009> years<00:01:54.219> but<00:01:54.579> trust<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.060> terms

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
ethic over the years but trust in terms

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.300 
ethic over the years but trust in terms
of<00:01:55.450> him<00:01:55.960> giving<00:01:56.140> us<00:01:56.319> feedback<00:01:56.499> so<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:56.920> can<00:01:57.159> plan

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
of him giving us feedback so we can plan

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.580 
of him giving us feedback so we can plan
as<00:01:57.490> week<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.600> i<00:01:58.929> guess<00:01:59.139> the<00:01:59.259> difference

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
as week so i guess the difference

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.899 
as week so i guess the difference
between<00:01:59.710> say<00:02:00.100> home<00:02:00.249> and<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> new<00:02:00.460> kid<00:02:00.759> on<00:02:00.789> the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
