twisting it and pushing it forward that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.840 
twisting it and pushing it forward that
kind<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.800> gives<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.130> little<00:02:16.160> lift<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.820> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
kind of gives it a little lift in the
