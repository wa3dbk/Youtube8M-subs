00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.580
 well what we are going to continue doing is 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.800
 pass our hook for our first 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.430
 half a point and we are going to form a chain 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.020
 so we form our first half point 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.260
 then we will continue doing for 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.880
 all these two cries means points with 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.610
 the difference that we will go alternating 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 let's make one in the first here 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.900
 milestone and let's do two in the second 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.970
 one in this two in this means 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.070
 that in this next one they are going to touch us 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.010
 make two half points in it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.589
 little hole 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.769
 and we are going to lose the stamen that 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.370
 we leave at the beginning in this case already 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.370
 we made 2 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.090
 so that it looks in this case we already did 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.090
 2 now what we are going to do is 1 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.510
 and in this we are going to do 2 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.549
 let's go alternating 1 and 2 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.159
 is a little uncomfortable from the beginning because of 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 template and the way I want them 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.830
 show me how to do it 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830
 then you will not do 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.070
 a half point 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.530
 well and we are going to do in this next but 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.530
 two 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.450
 You have to give 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 let's do 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.009
 another half point 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.009
 it is very easy to elaborate and in the next 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.600
 we continue with 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:17.740
 with a half point and we have 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.740
 at the half point and now we touch 2 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.629
 do not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.629
 and we do the other place in the same place 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.190
 and so we go the whole round 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190
 one 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.400
 and 2 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.540
 one 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.520
 even if your yarn is thicker 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.350
 what they can do is that like the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.290
 orchards are small and so they do not 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.260
 break can use one more hook 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.110
 small in the first round to be able 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.040
 make the first half points and already 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.530
 then continue weaving with one more hook 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.960
 thick for your yarn but in the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.310
 first round although it costs to pass it is 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.260
 convenient just because with a hook 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.260
 smallest me in this case I follow 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.379
 doing with a hook of number 3 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.379
 because our standard is not so thick 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.970
 then in this case there was another means 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.690
 point 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.690
 good 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.620
 It is one 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.829
 I better get like this so they can 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.829
 watch 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.900
 and finishing 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.610
 so that's how all our 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.610
 slipper
