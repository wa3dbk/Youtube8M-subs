one<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> most<00:00:10.469> interesting<00:00:11.160> looking

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
one of the most interesting looking

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.480 
one of the most interesting looking
boards<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> ladder<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.420> honest<00:00:12.690> then<00:00:12.990> I

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
boards in the ladder to be honest then I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.560 
boards in the ladder to be honest then I
must<00:00:14.490> admit<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.820> looks<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.120> lot<00:00:15.240> better<00:00:15.389> in

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
must admit this looks a lot better in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.490 
must admit this looks a lot better in
the<00:00:15.630> flesh<00:00:15.809> than<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> did<00:00:16.230> when<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> first

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the flesh than it did when I first

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.769 
the flesh than it did when I first
checked<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.160> online<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> activating

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
checked it online this is the activating

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
checked it online this is the activating
model<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.770> almost<00:00:19.920> put<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.340> into

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
model now you can almost put this into

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
model now you can almost put this into
two<00:00:20.699> halves<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.390> front<00:00:21.689> half<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.320> very

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
two halves the front half is very

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.320 
two halves the front half is very
similar<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.580> know<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> Dominator

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
similar to what we know it's a Dominator

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
similar to what we know it's a Dominator
the<00:00:25.199> real<00:00:25.439> half<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.980> completely<00:00:26.519> different

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the real half is completely different

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.930 
the real half is completely different
something<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.570> new<00:00:31.219> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.640> see

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
something very new you can really see

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.370 
something very new you can really see
those<00:00:33.120> differences<00:00:33.510> running<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> tail

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
those differences running to the tail

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
those differences running to the tail
obviously<00:00:35.040> coming<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.399> Aaron<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> 57

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
obviously coming up Aaron this is a 57

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
obviously coming up Aaron this is a 57
this<00:00:37.110> board<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.710> relatively<00:00:38.040> small<00:00:38.489> 19<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
this board so it's relatively small 19 a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
this board so it's relatively small 19 a
half<00:00:39.600> x<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> quarter<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> going

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
half x to the quarter and this is going

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
half x to the quarter and this is going
to<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.360> pocket<00:00:42.840> rocket<00:00:42.870> for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
to be a little pocket rocket for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.160 
to be a little pocket rocket for
anything<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.700> say<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> three<00:00:45.899> maybe

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
anything from say two to three maybe

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
anything from say two to three maybe
four<00:00:46.410> foot<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.879> board<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
four foot and this board is going to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
four foot and this board is going to
actually<00:00:48.480> fly<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.980> difference<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
actually fly it the difference then

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.240 
actually fly it the difference then
between<00:00:50.610> dominator<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> model<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
between dominator in this model is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
between dominator in this model is
obviously<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> second<00:00:53.910> half<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
obviously in this second half of the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
obviously in this second half of the
board<00:00:54.510> we've<00:00:55.079> got<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.230> double<00:00:55.920> wing<00:00:56.129> tail

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
board we've got this double wing tail

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
board we've got this double wing tail
and<00:00:56.879> down<00:00:57.360> into<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.960> moon<00:00:58.199> tail<00:00:58.500> shape

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and down into more of a moon tail shape

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700 
and down into more of a moon tail shape
really<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.340> call<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> coughing<00:01:00.149> tail<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
really they call it a coughing tail and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.660 
really they call it a coughing tail and
whichever<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
whichever way you want to look at it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
whichever way you want to look at it
it's<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.750> quite<00:01:03.930> progressive<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it's going to be quite progressive and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
it's going to be quite progressive and
it's<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> work<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.489> well<00:01:05.610> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's going to work really well in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.050 
it's going to work really well in
poverty<00:01:06.810> surf<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> surf<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
poverty surf and all if you surf in

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
poverty surf and all if you surf in
average<00:01:09.390> ways<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.229> surfing

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
average ways but you want to be surfing

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
average ways but you want to be surfing
back<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> pocket<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> fit<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
back in the pocket it's going to fit in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
back in the pocket it's going to fit in
very<00:01:12.600> nicely<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.220> moving<00:01:14.549> away<00:01:14.640> from

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
very nicely and it's moving away from

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
very nicely and it's moving away from
the<00:01:15.030> round<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> white<00:01:15.659> tail<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the round of white tail with the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
the round of white tail with the
Dominator<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> have

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
Dominator so you're not going to have

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
Dominator so you're not going to have
quite<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.970> much<00:01:18.090> speed<00:01:18.450> drive<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
quite as much speed drive and put the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
quite as much speed drive and put the
dominating<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.270> suit<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> more

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
dominating would suit the more

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
dominating would suit the more
intermediate<00:01:22.049> surfer<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
intermediate surfer and this is going to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
intermediate surfer and this is going to
work<00:01:23.820> better<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> slightly<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:24.990> either

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
work better for the slightly more either

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.960 
work better for the slightly more either

with your back foot placed here you've
still<00:01:35.400> got<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.850> thickness<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.600> width<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
still got good thickness and width so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
still got good thickness and width so
you've<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.560> food<00:01:37.860> flotation<00:01:38.549> good<00:01:38.729> drive<00:01:39.000> etc

you've got food flotation good drive etc

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510 
you've got food flotation good drive etc
as<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> step<00:01:40.530> further<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> further<00:01:41.159> back

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
as you step further and further back

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
as you step further and further back
you're<00:01:42.240> actually<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> run<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.170> relatively

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
you're actually in a run of relatively

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.740 
you're actually in a run of relatively
high<00:01:43.829> performance<00:01:44.399> thin<00:01:44.670> tail<00:01:44.970> which<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
high performance thin tail which is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
high performance thin tail which is
going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> our<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> board<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.500> turn<00:01:46.740> much

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to our the board to turn much

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.880 
going to our the board to turn much
easier<00:01:47.549> much<00:01:47.700> quicker<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.619> really<00:01:49.619> allow<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
easier much quicker and really allow you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.960 
easier much quicker and really allow you
to<00:01:50.040> maximize<00:01:50.270> tight<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> pockets

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
to maximize tight in the pockets

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.520 
to maximize tight in the pockets
whether<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.570> be<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.720> new<00:01:52.870> top<00:01:53.170> turn<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
whether you be a new top turn to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.770 
whether you be a new top turn to
cutbacks<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.640> even<00:01:54.880> borrow<00:01:55.210> writing<00:01:55.600> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
cutbacks now even borrow writing and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.330 
cutbacks now even borrow writing and
it's<00:01:56.110> going<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.290> hold<00:01:56.440> better<00:01:56.770> than<00:01:57.040> say<00:01:57.310> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
it's going to hold better than say the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's going to hold better than say the
standard<00:01:57.880> Dominator<00:01:58.300> tale<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:59.320> it's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
standard Dominator tale so it's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.050 
standard Dominator tale so it's
basically<00:01:59.710> going<00:01:59.980> to<00:02:00.130> be<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> loser<00:02:00.460> version

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
basically going to be a loser version

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.270 
basically going to be a loser version
and<00:02:01.240> possibly<00:02:02.230> slightly<00:02:02.410> faster<00:02:02.800> through<00:02:03.160> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
board that's going to work really well

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.229 
board that's going to work really well
in<00:03:26.500> small<00:03:26.830> average<00:03:27.130> surf<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.700> will<00:03:27.850> still<00:03:28.120> go

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
in small average surf it will still go

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.090 
in small average surf it will still go
all<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.420> way<00:03:28.450> overhead<00:03:28.989> but<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.860> going<00:03:29.980> to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
all the way overhead but it's going to

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.030 
all the way overhead but it's going to
lend<00:03:30.220> itself<00:03:30.519> best<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.150> small<00:03:31.510> pocket<00:03:32.049> e<00:03:32.200> surf

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
lend itself best to small pocket e surf

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.250 
lend itself best to small pocket e surf
and<00:03:33.910> you'll<00:03:34.269> maximize<00:03:34.480> those<00:03:34.930> kind<00:03:35.200> of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
and you'll maximize those kind of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.520 
and you'll maximize those kind of

obviously<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.950> parabolic<00:03:39.280> rail<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:39.940> going<00:03:40.090> to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
obviously a parabolic rail it's going to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.789 
obviously a parabolic rail it's going to
keep<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> board<00:03:40.630> lightweight<00:03:41.110> strong<00:03:41.500> and

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
keep the board lightweight strong and

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.190 
keep the board lightweight strong and
responsive<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.850> three<00:03:43.660> things<00:03:43.900> are<00:03:44.019> always

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
responsive and three things are always

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.900 
responsive and three things are always
going<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.470> help<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.680> surfing<00:03:45.100> but<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.850> this

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
going to help you surfing but and this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.559 
going to help you surfing but and this
is<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.120> brand-new<00:03:46.450> model<00:03:46.750> activator

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
is a brand-new model activator

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.030 
is a brand-new model activator
lots<00:03:48.659> of<00:03:48.749> exchange<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.439> looks<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.980> will

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
lots of exchange it looks like it will

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.339 
lots of exchange it looks like it will
work<00:03:50.099> very<00:03:50.280> very<00:03:50.670> well<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.930> think<00:03:51.989> we've

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
work very very well and I think we've

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.929 
work very very well and I think we've
seen<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> lot<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.829> these<00:03:53.099> in<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> water<00:03:53.579> and

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
seen a lot of these in the water and

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.959 
seen a lot of these in the water and
there's<00:03:54.389> some<00:03:54.950> available<00:03:55.950> online<00:03:56.069> now<00:03:56.400> thanks

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:56.969 
there's some available online now thanks

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.359 
there's some available online now thanks
