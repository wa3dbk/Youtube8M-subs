00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
all right so here is my 1982 honda

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.430 
all right so here is my 1982 honda
nighthawk<00:00:03.929> 450<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.509> I<00:00:06.509> just<00:00:06.750> finished<00:00:07.200> my

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
nighthawk 450 and I just finished my

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.549 
nighthawk 450 and I just finished my
physics<00:00:07.980> project<00:00:08.460> making<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.559> hydrogen

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
physics project making a hydrogen

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.030 
physics project making a hydrogen
generator<00:00:11.040> for<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.820> motorcycle<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> if<00:00:13.920> we

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
generator for the motorcycle so if we

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.269 
generator for the motorcycle so if we
look<00:00:14.190> down<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:15.289> right<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.529> front<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
look down here right in front of the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
look down here right in front of the
engine<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.180> will<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.050> hydrogen

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
engine here you will see the hydrogen

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.390 
engine here you will see the hydrogen
generator<00:00:19.830> there<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:21.000> eight<00:00:21.449> plates<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.400> four

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
generator there are eight plates of four

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
generator there are eight plates of four
inch<00:00:23.519> by<00:00:23.670> four<00:00:23.910> inch<00:00:23.939> stainless<00:00:24.240> steel<00:00:24.449> punch

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with eight holes four holes for the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.870 
with eight holes four holes for the
physical<00:00:30.390> holding<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:32.009> three

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
physical holding of it and then three

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
physical holding of it and then three
holes<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> bottom<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.770> hole<00:00:34.950> at

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
holes at the bottom and then one hole at

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.030 
holes at the bottom and then one hole at
the<00:00:35.130> top<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> hydrogen<00:00:35.969> export<00:00:37.040> then

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the top for the hydrogen export then

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.389 
the top for the hydrogen export then
from<00:00:38.370> there

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
from there

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
from there
that<00:00:41.399> goes<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> bubbler<00:00:42.840> container<00:00:43.309> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that goes up to a bubbler container this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.240 
that goes up to a bubbler container this
bubbler<00:00:44.850> container<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.480> gets<00:00:45.719> compressed

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
bubbler container then gets compressed

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
bubbler container then gets compressed
by<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> liquid<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.239> comes<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
by the liquid that comes from the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.580 
by the liquid that comes from the
generator<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:50.070> bubbles<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.320> then<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
generator it bubbles down and then the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
generator it bubbles down and then the
whole<00:00:52.680> cycle<00:00:53.129> starts<00:00:53.160> again<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
whole cycle starts again where the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
whole cycle starts again where the
original<00:00:54.870> liquid<00:00:55.500> comes<00:00:56.309> down<00:00:56.579> through<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
original liquid comes down through this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.260 
original liquid comes down through this
into<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> bottom<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> generator<00:00:59.340> so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
into the bottom of the generator so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
into the bottom of the generator so
don't<00:01:00.930> flick<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.980> give<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
don't flick it on here just to give you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.560 
don't flick it on here just to give you
a<00:01:02.640> quick<00:01:03.239> show<00:01:04.640> give<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> few<00:01:05.939> seconds<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
a quick show give it a few seconds and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.859 
a quick show give it a few seconds and
then<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.140> start<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> kick<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> there

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
then it will start to kick in and there

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
then it will start to kick in and there
we<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.580> I've<00:01:11.580> measured<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.700> 1.5<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
we go I've measured it for about 1.5 to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
we go I've measured it for about 1.5 to
2<00:01:15.600> liters<00:01:16.229> per<00:01:16.500> minute<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> hydrogen

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
2 liters per minute of hydrogen

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
2 liters per minute of hydrogen
generation<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.990> works<00:01:19.170> pretty<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:20.570> right

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
generation so it works pretty well right

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
generation so it works pretty well right
here<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:23.159> starting<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
here you can see it all just starting to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.050 
here you can see it all just starting to
go<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.340> first<00:01:26.580> time<00:01:26.729> doing<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
go in so for my very first time doing a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.370 
go in so for my very first time doing a
hydrogen<00:01:27.829> generator<00:01:28.829> project<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:31.020> works

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
hydrogen generator project it works

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.660 
hydrogen generator project it works
quite<00:01:31.799> well<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.470> bubbler<00:01:35.310> container

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
quite well so from the bubbler container

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
quite well so from the bubbler container
the<00:01:35.850> pressurized<00:01:36.270> bubbler<00:01:36.570> container<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the pressurized bubbler container that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
the pressurized bubbler container that
goes<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> tube<00:01:38.460> through<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> backflash

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
goes through a tube through a backflash

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.670 
goes through a tube through a backflash
rester<00:01:40.079> through<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> one-way<00:01:40.560> valve

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
rester through a one-way valve

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.139 
rester through a one-way valve
underneath<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> tank<00:01:43.430> down<00:01:44.430> underneath<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
underneath the tank down underneath the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.990

seat<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:47.360> air<00:01:48.360> intake

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.920 

for<00:01:53.079> electrical<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:54.320> have<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:54.829> simple<00:01:55.280> switch

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
for electrical I have a simple switch

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.289 
for electrical I have a simple switch
attached<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.500> my<00:01:57.979> brake<00:01:58.189> fluid<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:59.000> an

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
attached to my brake fluid here on an

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.179 
attached to my brake fluid here on an
off<00:01:59.450> switch<00:01:59.679> just<00:02:00.679> like<00:02:00.799> that

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
off switch just like that

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.389 
off switch just like that
and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.289> between<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.250> hydrogen

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
and then in between the hydrogen

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.009 
and then in between the hydrogen
generator<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.329> switch<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.899> have<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.950> fuse<00:02:08.019> 20

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
generator in the switch I have a fuse 20

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.759 
generator in the switch I have a fuse 20
amp<00:02:09.170> piece<00:02:09.519> and<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:12.170> protects<00:02:12.590> me<00:02:12.739> from

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
amp piece and that protects me from

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.050 
amp piece and that protects me from
shorting<00:02:13.580> myself<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.300> blow<00:02:14.720> myself<00:02:14.959> up

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
shorting myself and blow myself up

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.580 
shorting myself and blow myself up
anyway<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:18.590> hydrogen<00:02:19.220> generator
