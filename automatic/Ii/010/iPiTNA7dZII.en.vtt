00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.170
 and then people ex-manicure had to keep talking again is the doctor said little 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.929
 the post 7 then only 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.539
 I'm talking about how low-scale the most profitable with toy press release 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.829
 all because of these customers 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the orchard 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 first I will stop being the indicated inscription 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.439
 on the arnaldo evidence website 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.929
 the customer's decision 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.499
 so come on 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.750
 kika this Thursday 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.840
 on it the first click and save 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 then click here click here 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.090
 No, do not click there. 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.280
 Come here so I dare 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240
 and shows in the folder 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800
 then he will go bankrupt 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 to go with the car 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.030
 a pickup truck 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 now the trend is if you go near windows xp click on start there 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.820
 in executing 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 the same percentage in capital Maputo 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.390
 all 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 as a percentage of GDP 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.690
 until then 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.970
 not a little manicore here 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 and now bet of the peak 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.649
 and replace simon hinkler ticket so it ended up tumbling down 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.530
 click here you can not replace exchanges to puc in the river 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.289
 for this amount already paid which includes a ravine and athirson 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.850
 but to reinstall 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.470
 so it's just that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 but it can not render much more practical 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 klein 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.990

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240
 bucheroni

 and here is the tech guy 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.219
 ap 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.329
 the client for you to be inside what is the red loss video 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
 spared 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.739
 this is a failure that does not manifest 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.829
 in the form of a new agreement 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 intervener 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.839

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.069

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.619
 create a new world 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.759
 here is a boy baic so creatively 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:58.129
 conceived by my other listener, but so that I can see that the 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.969
 continent 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.129
 did effect 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.130
 and now I'm going to talk about my vote that gave you the moderator 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 but this may have been the main job 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.270
 one hundred and five can get impatient technical mike read 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.159
 let's export having still not have much 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:22.059
 I need a moderator, the team I want to just enter the channel or the blog month as 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.449
 leaving the description a channel youtube channel 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.029
 ef 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.559
 it was written there 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.739
 speak to be moderated 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.049
 the painting is the channel has to like the verdict 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.950
 the part I liked to inscribe it in the channel that historically dates the videos 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.519
 I'm getting out of here 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.889
 I joined my twitter too 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.889
 in the segment you have to come back with daily updates 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.169
 so it's just that 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.789
 so I'm talking because I'm passing was
