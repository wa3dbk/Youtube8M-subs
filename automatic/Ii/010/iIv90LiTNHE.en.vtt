everyone in this tutorial we're going to
show<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.990> force<00:00:07.170> field<00:00:07.410> are<00:00:07.649> McBride<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
show the force field are McBride and the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.620 
show the force field are McBride and the
tube<00:00:08.790> force<00:00:09.090> field<00:00:09.360> projector<00:00:10.940> yeah<00:00:11.940> hi<00:00:12.389> guys

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
tube force field projector yeah hi guys

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.780 
tube force field projector yeah hi guys
so<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> want<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.889> show<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> recipes<00:00:14.610> i'll

this<00:00:20.189> odd<00:00:20.930> advice<00:00:21.930> being<00:00:22.350> careful<00:00:22.980> because

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
this odd advice being careful because

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
this odd advice being careful because
you<00:00:23.310> can't<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.880> stuck<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> force<00:00:25.500> field

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you can't get stuck in the force field

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339 
you can't get stuck in the force field
if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.949> don't<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.199> could

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
if you don't do right and you could

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.009 
if you don't do right and you could
screw<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:29.189> natural<00:00:30.060> world<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
screw up your natural world because you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.370 
screw up your natural world because you
are<00:00:31.230> multiplying<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.859> cuz<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> get<00:00:32.430> stuck<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
are multiplying it cuz you get stuck and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
are multiplying it cuz you get stuck and
you<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:35.010> electrolyzer<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you will need an electrolyzer for the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
you will need an electrolyzer for the
electra<00:00:36.630> lifestyle<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:37.829> link<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
electra lifestyle but will link the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.910 
electra lifestyle but will link the
video<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.600> um<00:00:39.899> yeah<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.710> well<00:00:40.890> as

and with the actual dumb one you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
and with the actual dumb one you
shouldn't<00:00:50.670> Archie<00:00:50.940> gets<00:00:51.120> stuck<00:00:51.360> enough<00:00:51.660> no<00:00:52.199> no

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
shouldn't Archie gets stuck enough no no

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.799 
shouldn't Archie gets stuck enough no no
so<00:00:53.280> we'll<00:00:53.640> show<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:55.649> nice<00:00:55.829> down

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
so we'll show you this then to nice down

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.299

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
is ok so the doll will grade what this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
is ok so the doll will grade what this
does<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.329> stick<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.809> projector<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

you can actually dig underneath the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.039 
you can actually dig underneath the
force<00:01:25.229> field<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:25.650> oh<00:01:26.360> okay<00:01:27.360> Wow<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
force field now oh okay Wow with a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
force field now oh okay Wow with a
dialogue<00:01:28.409> guide<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.460> turned<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> damn

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
dialogue guide it turned just as a damn

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
dialogue guide it turned just as a damn
it<00:01:30.509> doesn't<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> actual<00:01:31.350> full

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it doesn't actually do the actual full

circle or the foursquare the full screen
on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> phone<00:01:35.400> scroll<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.229> but

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
on the phone scroll a little bit but

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
on the phone scroll a little bit but
yeah<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.590> actually<00:01:37.920> dig<00:01:38.040> underneath<00:01:38.280> and

outside and and player base then go back
into<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.990> force<00:01:43.170> field<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.560> Buck<00:01:43.680> look<00:01:43.890> yeah

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
into your force field and Buck look yeah

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.440 
into your force field and Buck look yeah
girl<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:46.170> saying<00:01:46.500> fuss<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.759> okay

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
go it's in so what you can do is you've

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360

got<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> air<00:02:29.940> radius<00:02:30.510> which<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.900> three<00:02:31.800> two<00:02:32.130> by

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
got the air radius which is three two by

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.450 
got the air radius which is three two by
two<00:02:32.430> squares<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.170> center<00:02:34.830> which<00:02:35.040> will

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
two squares you can do center which will

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.130 
two squares you can do center which will
actually<00:02:35.610> write<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.870> i<00:02:36.960> did<00:02:37.110> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually write on this so if i did that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.890 
actually write on this so if i did that
20<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.190> due<00:02:38.400> 10<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.030> wine<00:02:39.180> 10<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.570> way<00:02:39.720> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
20 it due 10 that wine 10 that way I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
20 it due 10 that wine 10 that way I
think<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.040> i<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.210> see<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.900> in

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
think so if i can get you see it's in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.280 
think so if i can get you see it's in
the<00:02:43.110> middle<00:02:43.230> oh<00:02:43.440> yeah<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.940> turn<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.090> off<00:02:45.290> put
