00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone and welcome to another video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.010
 Today I will be showing you my 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 interior for your science cane 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.250
 I'm very excited there was never 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.049
 participated the person participate only 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.460
 once in the marathon and I think it was me 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.700
 quite well was a marathon that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 organized ryan de pérez project does like 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.260
 a month and a half or something like that and I was 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.750
 pretty well I read like four or five 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.780
 books in six days I think it 's 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.090
 pretty good a little idea that both 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.070
 I hope already well but the idea is that we 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.100
 let's all have fun so I'm going to move on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.050
 our region 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.510
 one of the ways is to start and finish 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.219
 a series a saga and for that challenge 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.190
 I'm going to this version of a single saga that 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.399
 I have not started and complete in physical and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.680
 is the trilogy of the game chronicles of 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.620
 rior riordan that would be the retirement 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.449
 of the throne fire and being pressed another 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.339
 challenges is to read a book of a genre 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.899
 that there is not so much in the year and for the 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.000
 I 'm going to do a little bit of cheating 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.430
 because I think what he wanted to do 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 to say is of a genre that I did not read that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.080
 you read usually but I'm going to change it 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.600
 a little bit and it's going to be a genre that does not read 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.580
 a lot in the year I 'm going to stick halogens 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 I read this year but I'm going to read the one 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.319
 mere of and I do not know if they understand me inside 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
 of what is juvenile literature this year 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:21.229
 the fantasy and contemporary paranormal 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.940
 of which of the 44 books 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.250
 that I read are the three are contemporaries 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.990
 so I'm going to do it by being paper down 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.819
 I'm john green another one of the challenges is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.909
 read a book and see its adaptation 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.979
 cinematographic or tve and for that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.110
 challenge I will read e-books chips from 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.310
 frames soza that I'm going to read the book and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.000
 I'm going to watch the movie later because 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.740
 I have to see the movie of geeks 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.320
 another challenge is to read a book 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.870
 with images or drawings and for that I'm going to 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.090
 be reading my peculiar home perkins 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.500
 child grandel ronson grid the worst is that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.300
 I left this book for the last of the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.370
 noises are if I get to complete 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.830
 the other books because I have many 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.140
 want to read the following tour with 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.970
 this trial the challenges will be read a 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.460
 book that another person chosen by post 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 and I asked my mom to choose one 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.970
 of the books of me from my shelves my 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.340
 several shelves of books to read and my 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.370
 mom chose the one where the wolf of andréis 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 the first book in his new saga of 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.270
 river wolf men had that pretty 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 and the truth is that he did not choose it very well 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 the book because I have I think they are 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.540
 Containable May 2013 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.720
 will work not the truth that I do not know if what 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.920
 make the zone position at the beginning but 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.080
 maybe in the middle there I go 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.160
 and lead us to challenges is to read seven 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.610
 books or 300 pages per day so there are 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 So 27 books if everything goes well I hope 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.480
 I can read it though, if I have a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.459
 problem with those books I have three 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.190
 short books selected more or less 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.650
 like to read during the auction I have 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.780

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.640
 macfarlane this book I knew how to show 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.550
 in other videos if this book I'm going to 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.970
 be reading between readings and I 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.930
 I start bored and I am very and also 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.140
 I have these super short novels of something 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.000
 of christina de sport violates the law and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.620
 the case of the anonymous I love the books 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.480
 of agatha christie and they are like reading 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.340
 light for me maybe they are reading us 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.640
 this remedy I do not think he does but if 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.710
 I need to relax and not read books 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.630
 and that was it for the video I hope 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.250
 they liked it, do not forget to give it 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.900
 to like and find me down if they go to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.430
