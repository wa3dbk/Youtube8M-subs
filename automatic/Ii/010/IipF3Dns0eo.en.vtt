that's it ok so now that's the god I
took<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.620> go<00:01:52.770> ahead<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
took out and now you will go ahead and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.040 
took out and now you will go ahead and
take<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.760> CAD<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.240> slice<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.690> out<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
take out the CAD you slice it out of

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.930 
take out the CAD you slice it out of
this<00:01:55.200> deck<00:01:55.470> now<00:01:56.220> I'm<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.460> gonna<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.790> to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
this deck now I'm just gonna have to

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.730 
this deck now I'm just gonna have to
gnaw<00:01:57.120> for<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.510> purpose<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> performance

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
gnaw for the purpose of the performance

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.210 
gnaw for the purpose of the performance
that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.700> four<00:01:59.940> clubs<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.960> through<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that is the four clubs we go through and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.550 
that is the four clubs we go through and
it's<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.150> in<00:02:03.350> seaquest<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it's better to do this in seaquest and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.700 
it's better to do this in seaquest and
they<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.220> look<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:07.170> card<00:02:07.410> there

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
they just go and look for the card there

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
they just go and look for the card there
so<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.340> watched<00:02:08.490> four<00:02:08.940> clubs<00:02:09.390> which<00:02:09.660> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so actually watched four clubs which I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.510 
so actually watched four clubs which I
can't<00:02:10.170> seem<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> farm<00:02:10.979> right<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:12.410> ok<00:02:13.410> load<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
can't seem to farm right now ok load it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.300 
can't seem to farm right now ok load it
ok<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.720> cat<00:02:16.020> out<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.100> would

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
ok so take that cat out what this would

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.060 
ok so take that cat out what this would
all<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.460> done<00:02:17.810> without<00:02:18.810> speaking<00:02:19.590> since<00:02:19.890> bed

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
all be done without speaking since bed

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.890 
all be done without speaking since bed
set<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.430> within<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.820> performance<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.720> now

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
set up within the performance and now

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.340 
set up within the performance and now
boom<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.770> like<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.010> cad<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.540> they're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
boom just like that cad that they're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.890 
boom just like that cad that they're
selected<00:02:25.920> was<00:02:26.550> new<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:26.760> clubs<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.510> josiah

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
selected was new for clubs and josiah

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.650 
selected was new for clubs and josiah
pick<00:02:28.500> out<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> selected<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.150> fuckups

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
pick out the a selected with the fuckups

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.890 
pick out the a selected with the fuckups
boo<00:02:31.580> ok<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.700> quite<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> difficult<00:02:33.240> trick<00:02:33.780> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
boo ok it's quite a difficult trick to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.870 
boo ok it's quite a difficult trick to
understanding<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> performance<00:02:35.040> within<00:02:35.580> one

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
understanding the performance within one

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.160 
understanding the performance within one
so<00:02:36.030> explain<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
so explain it you going to get the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.480 
so explain it you going to get the
straight<00:02:37.500> away<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:37.950> you're<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> love

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
it exactly this is a great trick ok so

to go through you're going to save

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.130 
to go through you're going to save
stopping<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.830> card<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.670> taken<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.780> taking

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
stopping a card you taken out you taking

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.990 
stopping a card you taken out you taking
a<00:03:04.230> look<00:03:04.410> at<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.970> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
a look at it you know this is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.370 
a look at it you know this is
indifferent<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:06.989> need<00:03:07.200> this

whatsoever you don't even need to look
at<00:03:09.239> if<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.420> don't<00:03:09.600> want<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.080> tilt

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
at if you don't want so you just tilt

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.190 
at if you don't want so you just tilt
them<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:10.620> sad<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.280> turn<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.550> looking<00:03:11.850> on<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
them as sad as to turn you looking on it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.410 
them as sad as to turn you looking on it
I'm<00:03:13.200> not<00:03:13.410> really<00:03:13.940> bothering<00:03:14.940> about<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.300> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
I'm not really bothering about what the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.720 
I'm not really bothering about what the
card<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> doesn't<00:03:16.260> matter<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.130> soon<00:03:17.580> as<00:03:17.640> I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
card is it doesn't matter so soon as I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.460 
card is it doesn't matter so soon as I
just<00:03:17.940> pretend<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.300> took<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.570> look<00:03:18.780> at<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.019> put

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
just pretend I took a look at this put

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.800 
just pretend I took a look at this put
it<00:03:19.560> back<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.709> top<00:03:20.209> obviously<00:03:21.209> without<00:03:21.330> mission

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it back on top obviously without mission

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.509 
it back on top obviously without mission
it<00:03:21.989> shields<00:03:22.320> bit<00:03:22.470> system<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:22.980> see<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.310> and

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
it shields bit system and see it and

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.000 
it shields bit system and see it and
just<00:03:24.450> go<00:03:24.570> ahead<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.780> cut<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.200> right<00:03:25.380> into<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
just go ahead and cut it right into the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.120 
just go ahead and cut it right into the
middle<00:03:26.780> ok<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.050> then<00:03:28.350> what<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.590> will<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:28.860> is

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
middle ok now then what you will do is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
middle ok now then what you will do is
you<00:03:29.160> go<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.720> expect<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.110> lot<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.470> those

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
you go to expect that of a lot of those
