00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Welcome to the gaming and before 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.899
 all things on benchmark special 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 the samsung galaxy note per 12 2 by 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.620
 mobile-review de let's start with the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 standard benchmarks i take the end 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 to weeks 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 you always have to be a bit 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 be careful in samsung device and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.029
 udo that is not always compatible 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 The device tends then something 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 to exaggerate but I'm starting now 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 simply with the test at the tubik should 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 yes, something more resistant what the chips 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.740
 of course he turns 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.660
 idiotic wise in the upright format and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 That's why we're about to join in as well 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.739
 that's achieved in tutow iks benchmark 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 samsung galaxy note per 12.29 35,000 745 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 counter and sat down with it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 top 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.270
 continue at this point with the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.789
 There are three of them I also use from benchmarks 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 and we make a little break the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 makes the result 937 counter in single 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.789
 core 2825 in the multi core catcher if one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.910
 that now compares and relativizes 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.420
 For example, the ricoh highway achieved here so 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 the 530 in single you can about 2500 in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 multicore that's not then so 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.150
 a lot of the difference here are yes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 we benchmark in beautiful 3 d mark 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.360
 you can already see the high-tech equipment here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.890
 that was somehow unlimited version 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.540
 everything else would be in favor of that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.450
 processor just way too fast 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 here we see the results 3 d mark 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 ice storm extreme max thaws naturally 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.299
 Graphite used to be almost 60 frames in the past 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.329
 second 44.4 and in the physics test 49.1 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.700
 frames per second 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.590
 yes and last but not least the graphics 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
 the gfx band stand if I now too 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 Let's start it all and it will take now 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 few minutes there is now a lot 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.360
 displayed a lot, I think 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.430
 We save the details unless 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.259
 you want beautiful colorful pretty 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.850
 But you are actually animation 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.509
 could look at gets on your 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.490
 maybe not so fluid then 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.229
 you see here at the effects it is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.329
 So really something to the processor 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.680
 until the end of rheydt they must be you 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.290
 absolutely the times really look 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240
 if possible on the sector snapdragon 800 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.069
 upwards you see really cool 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.670
 scenes that are probably only in 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.520
 some years in games 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.120
 You will see here, for example 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.640
 the part with the terex and after I say 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.319
 just ktm through the botany 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.470
 that really looks real here too 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.020
 supergeil we are funny together 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.540
 results of the path or graphics 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.130
 benchmarks total 296 respectively 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.989
 Count 501 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.480
 6 939 or 1464 if I compare that 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.060
 with other devices, I come to the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 total average value of 1801 points 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 not the biggest , after all 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.610
 upmarket I say times field 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.769
 Of course, the eight racing asphalt racing game 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.350
 what you look at his today 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.959
 snapdragon smartphone or in this 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 Just use the smart pad or tablet 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.319
 whatever you want to call it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.080
 individual games currently very expensive 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.970
 are maximal as far as the graphics are concerned 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.310
 Detailstufe here the whole running 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.769
 Of course little surprised and I say 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.290
 times completely smoothly the what of 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.200
 other devices with the snapdragon 800 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.769
 also recognize 2 3 ghz rich of course 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.109
 also from around this game here very nice 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.620
 on the 1200 2 inch display too 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.940
 gamble 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.650
 I've got it all over here now 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.880
 touchscreen variant changed because it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.410
 then it looks a bit strange though 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.660
 you have this huge tablet in front of your eyes 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.450
 back and forth turns around so to speak the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.700
 to select gesture control here with 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.530
 lance read all the usual effects 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.989
 the big screens as I said 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:46.690
 very nice game gta san andreas in 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.579
 The maximum detail level is more 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.859
 not me i have already set high 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.709
 I'm back on my beautiful bmx bike 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.730
 on the way there jerky next time 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.290
 nothing about that, of course, that does of course 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.720
 just like everyone else play on 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.940
 this display really fun 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.510
 provided you ride the bike 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:09.220
 also halfway mastered front smaller 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.560
 really over the railroad tracks or 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.950
 a turnaround on the front wheel man 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.780
 can turn them as you like 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.650
 and you can also descend very nicely 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.200
 maybe you should do that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.320
 and then just go on foot or 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.690
 orderly 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.390
 whiz up the next best car 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.030
 the feet throw something in the case 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:36.610
 work has because the good ground because 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:39.550
 it beat in neck and let's go yes 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.220
 also a bit faster 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.890
 of course also here 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.890
 say to play fluently 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.430
 close by is also driving over 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.730
 his strength has never been called 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.070
 you can play superfluid 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.380
 we catch portable with the playstation 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.600
 get emulator in android store on 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.860
 the 12 2 inch display will run the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.230
 Of course, thanks to the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.490
 have completely problem snapdragon 800 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.090
 this against the demo version 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.840
 they once decided with Chinese 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.730
 speech output is but the whole is 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.660
 really completely smooth behind me 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.210
 will probably fall right back 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.610
 doors and halls 1 and it gets a lot 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.900
 talked the hate many writings and 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.980
 RotkÃ¤ppchen also seems straight 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.280
 to have arrived 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.190
 so I have to answer countless numbers 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.860
 give and see pictures in 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.230
 this cute little one obviously 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.510
 but also quite pointless game 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.640
 as I said it runs absolutely smooth and 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.220
 You can also easily if you are 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.570
 the necessary sources know each other 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.030
 raums provide a bit more 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.340
 make fun as here this little because 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.440
 i want my gaming special of course 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.050
 with my favorite emulator 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.230
 joystick nds simulator that is called here 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.240
 also full screen high healthy absolutely 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.840
 never been such a big gameboy 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.260
 seen like this 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.660
 even the xl still sees little hair 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.030
 really tiny with a 12 2 inches 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.460
 big display of course animal 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.460
 the hammer that was nothing right 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.130
 fun 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.169
 to play with it all the games 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.630
 I've tested so far run 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:33.009
 as expected, I am completely liquid 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:35.470
 curious how the snapdragon 801 in 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:39.880
 True will be until then I would 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.740
 say goodbye and see you in the morning 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.229
 All the games I tested here 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.930
 in the special I ran absolutely liquid 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:51.490
 I'm curious how the snapdragon 801 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.139
 then in the test with the HTC power 2014 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.360
 I will say otherwise 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.220
 who takes this thing here to 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.410
 He has certainly one of the games 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.810
 largest game consoles for on the go 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.550
 there are times that's for special 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.410
 I would say we see each other in one 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.940
 further test report or special 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.460
 tester cookies of course 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.470
 my website mobile - reviews de links 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.090
 shown above on the bottom left 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.039
 you subscribe to a youtube channel 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.050
 Of course, I'm happy about that as well 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.820
 how about one or the other thumb 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.960
 high if you like this little special 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.960
 liked
