00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
overview of what the project is and then

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.549 
overview of what the project is and then
show<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.079> UVU<00:00:41.649> I<00:00:41.829> oh<00:00:42.160> yeah<00:00:42.670> so<00:00:43.480> what<00:00:44.170> our

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
show to the UVU I oh yeah so what our

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.520 
show to the UVU I oh yeah so what our
sort<00:00:45.100> was<00:00:45.430> actually<00:00:46.269> how<00:00:46.719> can<00:00:46.750> we<00:00:47.050> change<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
sort was actually how can we change the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.450 
sort was actually how can we change the
easy<00:00:47.829> experience<00:00:48.449> from<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.570> normal<00:00:49.870> desktop

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
easy experience from the normal desktop

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.849 
easy experience from the normal desktop
and<00:00:51.460> how<00:00:52.059> does<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.359> user<00:00:52.629> actually<00:00:53.050> interact

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
and how does the user actually interact

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.549 
and how does the user actually interact
with<00:00:54.160> touch<00:00:55.149> devices<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.710> our<00:00:57.219> idea<00:00:57.340> was<00:00:57.730> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
with touch devices so our idea was that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.660 
with touch devices so our idea was that
normally<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.620> have<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.890> project<00:01:00.219> you're

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
normally you have a project you're

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.569 
normally you have a project you're
actually<00:01:01.120> running<00:01:01.539> on<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:02.440> have<00:01:02.980> some<00:01:03.339> kind

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
actually running on you have some kind

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.240 
actually running on you have some kind
of<00:01:03.670> thing<00:01:04.059> you're<00:01:04.930> working<00:01:05.290> on<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.620> it's<00:01:05.980> all

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
of thing you're working on and it's all

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.910 
of thing you're working on and it's all
together<00:01:06.640> with<00:01:07.090> applications<00:01:07.840> which<00:01:08.530> are<00:01:08.650> use

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
together with applications which are use

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.240 
together with applications which are use
it<00:01:09.190> which<00:01:09.460> you're<00:01:09.670> using<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.890> have<00:01:11.980> different

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250

it which you're using you have different
activities<00:01:12.880> actually<00:01:13.540> so<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.950> have<00:01:15.100> here<00:01:15.310> on

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
activities actually so we have here on

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.740 
activities actually so we have here on
the<00:01:15.490> left<00:01:15.730> on<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.300> writer<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:18.880> activity<00:01:19.390> few

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
the left on a writer an activity few

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.510 
the left on a writer an activity few
which<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.890> actually<00:01:21.580> allowing<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.680> well

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
which is actually allowing you to well

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.700 
which is actually allowing you to well
to<00:01:25.120> switch<00:01:25.360> between<00:01:25.570> different<00:01:25.810> activities

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
to switch between different activities

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.700 
to switch between different activities
so<00:01:27.580> for<00:01:27.910> example<00:01:27.940> you're<00:01:28.480> having<00:01:29.290> here<00:01:29.500> your

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
so for example you're having here your

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
so for example you're having here your
diploma<00:01:30.070> tase's<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:32.170> actually

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
diploma tase's and you're actually

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.400 
diploma tase's and you're actually
decide<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.420> you're<00:01:34.750> planning<00:01:35.320> your

place and so on the other side you have

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.560 
place and so on the other side you have
your<00:02:12.900> recommendation<00:02:13.530> list<00:02:13.710> which<00:02:14.670> allows

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
your recommendation list which allows

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.730 
your recommendation list which allows
you<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.380> simply<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:18.570> shows<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.140> new<00:02:19.410> stuff

there on a research project so you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.550 
there on a research project so you
researching<00:02:35.310> new<00:02:35.700> ways<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:37.050> people<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
researching new ways for for people to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.400 
researching new ways for for people to
interact<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.190> touch<00:02:38.550> devices<00:02:39.020> because<00:02:40.020> well

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
interact with touch devices because well

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
interact with touch devices because well
the<00:02:40.770> current<00:02:41.160> way<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> interact<00:02:42.120> through

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the current way to interact through

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.350 
the current way to interact through
directories<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> stuff<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.000> doesn't

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
directories and all the stuff it doesn't

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.260 
directories and all the stuff it doesn't
really<00:02:45.510> fit<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:46.020> finger<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
really fit your finger and but that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.950 
really fit your finger and but that
that's<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.840> idea<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.820> well<00:02:50.820> mobile<00:02:51.360> devices

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
that's the idea and well mobile devices

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.950 
that's the idea and well mobile devices
in<00:02:52.590> particular<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.400> all<00:02:53.700> devices<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.720> have

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
in particular but all devices do have

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.490 
in particular but all devices do have
certain<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:56.070> certain<00:02:56.520> sensors<00:02:57.090> well<00:02:58.080> as<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
certain one certain sensors well as I

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.330 
certain one certain sensors well as I
said<00:02:58.740> like<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> GPS<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:01.530> will<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:02.070> help

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
said like the GPS and it will just help

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.060 
said like the GPS and it will just help
you<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.090> faster<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.200> what<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.800> want

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
you to get faster to what you want

said<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.400> research<00:03:36.760> project<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.450> running<00:03:37.840> on

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
said the research project is running on

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.850 
said the research project is running on
wiz<00:03:38.590> with<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.570> university<00:03:40.570> way<00:03:41.260> they<00:03:41.710> are

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
wiz with the university way they are

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.140 
wiz with the university way they are
doing<00:03:42.220> all<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:43.709> research<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> how<00:03:45.610> do<00:03:46.090> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
doing all the research on the how do I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.660 
doing all the research on the how do I
gather<00:03:46.570> all<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.140> data<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.770> mean<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.520> lot<00:03:48.610> of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
gather all the data I mean it's a lot of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.480 
gather all the data I mean it's a lot of
danger<00:03:49.090> there<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.900> another<00:03:50.500> part<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.190> is

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
danger there and another part of it is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.390 
danger there and another part of it is
that<00:03:51.700> oh<00:03:52.240> we<00:03:52.990> are<00:03:53.140> starting<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.709> think<00:03:54.100> about

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
that oh we are starting to think about

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.010 
that oh we are starting to think about
concepts<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.620> from<00:03:57.490> from<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.360> facebook<00:03:58.780> site

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
concepts so from from the facebook site

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.380 
concepts so from from the facebook site
for<00:03:59.440> example<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.860> have<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.430> button<00:04:00.850> but

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
for example you have to like button but

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.510 
for example you have to like button but
you<00:04:01.480> don't<00:04:01.660> have<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.020> on<00:04:02.170> your<00:04:02.320> local<00:04:02.530> pc<00:04:03.100> why

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
you don't have it on your local pc why

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.940 
you don't have it on your local pc why
not<00:04:03.760> because<00:04:04.720> well<00:04:05.200> that's<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.560> thing<00:04:05.739> you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
not because well that's the thing you

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.070 
not because well that's the thing you
like<00:04:06.190> this<00:04:06.430> data<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:07.060> like<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.570> this

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
like this data you like this this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.190 
like this data you like this this
picture<00:04:08.830> on<00:04:09.040> your<00:04:09.070> computer<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.989> will

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
picture on your computer and this will

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.900 
picture on your computer and this will
all<00:04:11.230> come<00:04:11.680> together<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:12.160> new<00:04:12.250> recommendation

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
all come together a new recommendation

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.910 
all come together a new recommendation
so<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.080> run<00:04:14.290> through<00:04:14.500> those<00:04:14.709> UI

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
so this just run through those UI

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.440 
so this just run through those UI
element<00:04:15.430> elements<00:04:15.790> again<00:04:16.030> you've<00:04:16.180> got<00:04:16.209> this

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
element elements again you've got this

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.199 
element elements again you've got this
screens<00:04:17.350> quit<00:04:17.739> switching<00:04:18.120> component<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
screens quit switching component on the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.110

through the existing screens you can

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.240 
through the existing screens you can
lock<00:04:25.720> one<00:04:25.960> into<00:04:26.169> place<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.740> select<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.220> by

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
lock one into place to select it by

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.190 
lock one into place to select it by
locking<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.690> then<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:28.930> get<00:04:29.050> the

about making it popping up when you when
you<00:04:44.860> make<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.190> soon<00:04:45.520> gesture<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.330> example<00:04:47.250> you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
you make a soon gesture for example you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.540 
you make a soon gesture for example you
can<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.760> context-sensitive<00:04:49.630> menus<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:51.340> can

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
can do context-sensitive menus you can

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.370 
can do context-sensitive menus you can
well<00:04:52.060> legs<00:04:52.720> selected<00:04:53.380> yeah<00:04:54.330> well<00:04:55.380> it's

of networking and a coup battery citizen
you<00:05:29.220> know<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.670> just<00:05:29.970> ask<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.240> question<00:05:30.510> how

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
you know I just ask you question how

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.150 
you know I just ask you question how
long<00:05:30.870> did<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.140> take<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.650> put<00:05:32.040> this

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
long did it take you to put this

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.550 
long did it take you to put this
together<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.700> what<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.270> use<00:05:33.560> previously

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
together and what you use previously

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.670 
together and what you use previously
available<00:05:35.400> components<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:36.240> do<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.540> so<00:05:37.530> the

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
available components to do it so the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.190 
available components to do it so the
project<00:05:38.100> original<00:05:38.610> was<00:05:39.030> kicked<00:05:39.330> off<00:05:39.540> several

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
project original was kicked off several

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.920 
project original was kicked off several
weeks<00:05:40.500> ago<00:05:40.650> so<00:05:41.460> they<00:05:41.610> were<00:05:41.760> huge<00:05:42.150> kick<00:05:42.480> off<00:05:42.660> and

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
weeks ago so they were huge kick off and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.290 
weeks ago so they were huge kick off and
I<00:05:43.560> think<00:05:43.890> it's<00:05:44.040> about<00:05:44.220> six<00:05:44.820> or<00:05:44.970> eight<00:05:45.240> weeks

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
I think it's about six or eight weeks

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.580 
I think it's about six or eight weeks
old<00:05:46.010> so<00:05:47.010> what<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:47.940> here<00:05:48.390> is<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.630> mock-up<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.230> this

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
old so what is here is a mock-up of this

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.100 
old so what is here is a mock-up of this
idea<00:05:50.040> and<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:51.180> first<00:05:51.420> release<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.900> planned

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
plasma customer touch plasma active here

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.470 
plasma customer touch plasma active here
and

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.840 
and
good<00:06:02.080> think<00:06:02.470> that's<00:06:02.680> great<00:06:02.950> all<00:06:03.490> right<00:06:03.640> that's

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
good think that's great all right that's

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.000 
good think that's great all right that's
