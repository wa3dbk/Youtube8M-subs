00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.469 

although<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.040> dull<00:01:16.220> helped<00:01:16.850> me<00:01:17.030> cut<00:01:17.210> nice

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
although the dull helped me cut nice

perfect<00:01:17.990> ly<00:01:18.710> round<00:01:18.950> tubes<00:01:19.720> leaving<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.810> devil

perfect ly round tubes leaving the devil

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.570 
perfect ly round tubes leaving the devil
in<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> gluing<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.090> stuff<00:01:24.399> ended<00:01:25.399> up

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
in for the gluing and stuff ended up

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.850 
in for the gluing and stuff ended up
warping<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.149> tubes<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.080> now<00:01:27.259> I'm<00:01:27.470> gonna<00:01:27.619> have

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
warping the tubes so now I'm gonna have

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.490 
warping the tubes so now I'm gonna have
to<00:01:27.950> do<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> bit<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.690> probably<00:01:29.690> a<00:01:29.750> bit<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:29.990> sanding

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
to do a bit of probably a bit of sanding

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.460 
to do a bit of probably a bit of sanding
for<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.490> shaping<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.840> try<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.110> get<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.289> tools

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
for the shaping to try and get the tools

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.139 
for the shaping to try and get the tools
back<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.009> right<00:01:34.160> shape<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.759> Pistons

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
back to the right shape so the Pistons

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.499 
back to the right shape so the Pistons
slide<00:01:35.390> again<00:01:36.039> but<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:37.610> probably<00:01:37.970> can<00:01:38.210> recover

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
slide again but I probably can recover

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.690 
slide again but I probably can recover
from<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.990> all<00:01:39.590> right<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.950> cut<00:01:40.160> this<00:01:40.280> piece<00:01:40.490> on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
from that all right I cut this piece on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
from that all right I cut this piece on
the<00:01:40.910> scroll<00:01:41.149> saw<00:01:42.700> quarter<00:01:43.700> inch<00:01:43.850> oak<00:01:44.710> there's

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the scroll saw quarter inch oak there's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.740 
the scroll saw quarter inch oak there's
a<00:01:45.830> pattern<00:01:46.190> right<00:01:46.310> here<00:01:46.369> on<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.910> side<00:01:47.539> where

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
a pattern right here on the side where

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.719 
a pattern right here on the side where
it's<00:01:47.869> gonna<00:01:47.960> get<00:01:48.110> glued<00:01:48.380> down<00:01:48.560> I'm<00:01:49.490> going<00:01:49.670> to

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
it's gonna get glued down I'm going to

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.140 
it's gonna get glued down I'm going to
just<00:01:49.940> line<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.180> up<00:01:50.420> real<00:01:50.660> good

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
just line it up real good

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.630 
just line it up real good
then<00:01:53.150> make<00:01:53.330> some<00:01:53.360> reference<00:01:54.170> marks<00:01:54.590> I'll<00:01:55.250> just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
then make some reference marks I'll just

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.240 
then make some reference marks I'll just
make<00:01:55.880> some<00:01:56.090> marks<00:01:56.360> right<00:01:56.540> here

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.719 

take<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.430> off<00:02:01.610> later<00:02:02.770> erase<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.369> we'll

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
take that off later erase it and we'll

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.759 
take that off later erase it and we'll
not<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:06.710> way<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:06.860> can<00:02:07.100> take<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:08.649> pattern<00:02:09.649> off

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
not the way I can take the pattern off

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.900 
not the way I can take the pattern off
this<00:02:09.979> side<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.429> block<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.239> loop<00:02:11.510> down

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.360 
little different technique than I have
in<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> past<00:03:06.830> I'm<00:03:07.830> gonna<00:03:08.070> drill<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:10.560> down<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
in the past I'm gonna drill just down to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.550 
in the past I'm gonna drill just down to
the<00:03:11.490> top<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.300> down<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.110> top<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the top just down to the top of the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.770 
the top just down to the top of the
cylinder<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.220> no<00:03:14.370> further<00:03:14.640> not<00:03:15.420> through<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
cylinder but no further not through it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
cylinder but no further not through it
with<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.620> Brad<00:03:16.890> tipped<00:03:17.420> drill<00:03:18.420> bit<00:03:20.120> just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
with my Brad tipped drill bit just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.940 
with my Brad tipped drill bit just
enough<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.110> point<00:03:22.380> punctures

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
enough so that that the point punctures

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.230 
enough so that that the point punctures
the<00:03:23.540> cylinder<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> little<00:03:24.840> bit<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:26.760> I'm<00:03:26.910> going

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
the cylinder a little bit then I'm going

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.600 
the cylinder a little bit then I'm going
to<00:03:28.100> glue<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.370> tube<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.790> place<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:32.370> once

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
to glue the tube in place then once

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.120 
to glue the tube in place then once
that's<00:03:32.880> set<00:03:33.209> up<00:03:33.470> we're<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> drill<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.010> up

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
that's set up we're going to drill it up

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.070 
that's set up we're going to drill it up
the<00:03:35.250> rest<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.610> way<00:03:35.730> with<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.120> size<00:03:36.840> that

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
the rest of the way with the size that

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:50.190 
the rest of the way with the size that
fits<00:03:37.320> inside<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.860> tube

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.850 

I<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.590> pattern<00:03:51.830> off<00:03:53.380> something<00:03:54.380> smaller

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
I have the pattern off something smaller

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.290 
I have the pattern off something smaller
than<00:03:55.040> when<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> was<00:03:55.550> Jesus<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.060> get<00:03:56.209> the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
than when I was Jesus and I get the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.930 
than when I was Jesus and I get the
balloon<00:03:56.569> on<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.840> sides<00:03:57.140> here<00:03:57.740> I'll<00:03:58.550> just<00:03:58.700> use

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
balloon on the sides here I'll just use

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.470 
balloon on the sides here I'll just use
another<00:03:59.150> tube<00:03:59.480> smaller<00:04:00.020> -<00:04:00.319> oh<00:04:04.090> that's<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.300> big

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
another tube smaller - oh that's the big

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.600 
another tube smaller - oh that's the big
one

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
one

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:25.520 
one
hump<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.670> up<00:04:07.819> in<00:04:08.000> there<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.300> little<00:04:08.450> bit

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.330 

get<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.700> there

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.980 

you<00:04:29.790> know<00:04:29.880> I'll<00:04:29.970> glue<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:30.330> place<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.840> blue

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
you know I'll glue it in place the blue

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.810 
you know I'll glue it in place the blue
set<00:04:31.290> up<00:04:31.440> now<00:04:31.980> I'm<00:04:32.040> just<00:04:32.250> gonna<00:04:32.370> drill<00:04:32.670> them

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
set up now I'm just gonna drill them

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:58.810 
set up now I'm just gonna drill them
through

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.140 

all<00:04:59.210> right<00:04:59.390> I'm<00:04:59.870> jewel<00:05:00.050> all<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.320> way<00:05:00.440> through

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
all right I'm jewel all the way through

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.870 
all right I'm jewel all the way through
they're<00:05:02.150> all<00:05:02.270> gonna<00:05:02.390> have<00:05:02.480> lips<00:05:02.840> for<00:05:03.140> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
they're all gonna have lips for the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.840 
they're all gonna have lips for the
jewel<00:05:04.880> came<00:05:05.120> through<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.530> it'll<00:05:06.710> take<00:05:06.890> is<00:05:07.700> with

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
jewel came through so it'll take is with

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.000 
jewel came through so it'll take is with
my<00:05:08.030> rotary<00:05:08.360> tool<00:05:08.660> I'll<00:05:09.110> go<00:05:09.350> in<00:05:09.530> here<00:05:09.740> kind<00:05:09.890> of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
my rotary tool I'll go in here kind of

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.280 
my rotary tool I'll go in here kind of
at<00:05:10.130> an<00:05:10.220> angle<00:05:10.480> it's<00:05:11.480> kind<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.780> grind<00:05:12.020> them<00:05:12.140> off

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
at an angle it's kind of grind them off

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.030 
at an angle it's kind of grind them off
a<00:05:12.320> little<00:05:12.590> bit<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:15.230> pretty<00:05:15.500> much<00:05:15.650> given<00:05:15.980> up

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
a little bit and pretty much given up

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.380 
a little bit and pretty much given up
hope<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.580> was<00:05:16.670> going<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.850> be<00:05:16.940> able<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.180> save

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
hope that I was going to be able to save

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.790 
hope that I was going to be able to save
the<00:05:17.600> that's<00:05:18.350> first<00:05:18.680> run<00:05:18.920> at<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.190> engine<00:05:19.520> block

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
the that's first run at the engine block

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.090 
the that's first run at the engine block
piston<00:05:21.800> wasn't<00:05:22.130> fitting<00:05:23.860> something<00:05:24.860> with<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
piston wasn't fitting something with the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.680 
piston wasn't fitting something with the
drying<00:05:25.370> process<00:05:25.460> I<00:05:26.000> believe<00:05:26.030> with<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:26.510> dolls

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
drying process I believe with the dolls

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.030 
drying process I believe with the dolls
and<00:05:26.930> they<00:05:27.050> had<00:05:27.170> warped<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.560> tubes

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
and they had warped the tubes

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.470 
and they had warped the tubes
what<00:05:28.790> I<00:05:28.820> did<00:05:29.060> here<00:05:29.500> first<00:05:31.000> first<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.090> rammed<00:05:32.330> it

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
what I did here first first I rammed it

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.970 
what I did here first first I rammed it
out<00:05:32.630> with<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:34.330> half-inch<00:05:35.330> bit<00:05:35.600> left<00:05:36.560> inside

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
out with the half-inch bit left inside

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.710 
out with the half-inch bit left inside
pretty<00:05:37.190> Scout<00:05:37.520> scuffed<00:05:38.090> up<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.900> also<00:05:40.720> still

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
pretty Scout scuffed up and also still

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.740 
pretty Scout scuffed up and also still
didn't<00:05:41.990> fix<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:42.950> situation<00:05:43.480> what<00:05:44.480> I<00:05:44.510> have

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
didn't fix the situation what I have

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.880 
didn't fix the situation what I have
here<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:46.190> piece<00:05:46.700> of<00:05:46.730> 800<00:05:47.210> grit<00:05:47.360> sandpaper

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
here is a piece of 800 grit sandpaper

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.990 
here is a piece of 800 grit sandpaper
probably<00:05:48.890> could<00:05:49.010> have<00:05:49.100> started<00:05:49.340> with<00:05:49.460> 600

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
probably could have started with 600

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.390 
probably could have started with 600
would<00:05:50.060> have<00:05:50.180> saved<00:05:50.300> myself<00:05:50.480> a<00:05:50.750> little<00:05:50.870> time

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
would have saved myself a little time

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.090 
would have saved myself a little time
but<00:05:52.400> I'll<00:05:52.550> basically<00:05:52.940> go<00:05:53.350> from<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.560> 800<00:05:54.980> and

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
but I'll basically go from the 800 and

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.560 
but I'll basically go from the 800 and
then<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:55.460> some<00:05:55.670> 2,000<00:05:56.180> grit<00:05:56.300> sandpaper

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
then I have some 2,000 grit sandpaper

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.680 
then I have some 2,000 grit sandpaper
which<00:05:56.960> I'll<00:05:57.110> finish<00:05:57.290> up<00:05:57.530> with<00:05:57.770> but<00:05:58.760> it'll<00:05:59.660> work

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
which I'll finish up with but it'll work

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.830 
which I'll finish up with but it'll work
with<00:05:59.930> this

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.500 

after<00:06:06.410> sanding<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.980> and<00:06:07.820> I<00:06:07.910> can't<00:06:08.120> go<00:06:08.300> through

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
after sanding it and I can't go through

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.480 
after sanding it and I can't go through
and<00:06:08.780> get<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.110> dust<00:06:09.290> out<00:06:09.560> because<00:06:09.860> that<00:06:10.070> kind

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
and get the dust out because that kind

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.850 
and get the dust out because that kind
of<00:06:10.550> sticks<00:06:11.389> up<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:11.690> engine<00:06:12.020> -<00:06:14.350> well<00:06:15.350> I'm<00:06:15.680> gonna

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
of sticks up the engine - well I'm gonna

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.850
