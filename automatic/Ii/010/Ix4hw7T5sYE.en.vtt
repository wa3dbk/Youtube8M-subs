00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229 
so this here is it gets no 2180 tripod

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.680 
so this here is it gets no 2180 tripod
head<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:08.130> counterbalance<00:00:08.820> mechanism<00:00:09.570> we're

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
head the counterbalance mechanism we're

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.600 
head the counterbalance mechanism we're
talking<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.429> little

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
talking about this is just this little

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.640 
talking about this is just this little
button<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.059> by<00:00:12.480> pushing<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.049> head<00:00:13.200> forward

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
button here by pushing the head forward

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.520 
button here by pushing the head forward
I<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.639> turn<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> counterbalance<00:00:15.809> mechanism

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
I can turn the counterbalance mechanism

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.890 
I can turn the counterbalance mechanism
on<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.119> spring<00:00:18.480> loads<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
on as you can see it's spring loads the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.560 
on as you can see it's spring loads the
head<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> tip<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.189> tripod<00:00:20.730> head

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
head to want to tip the tripod head

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.249 
head to want to tip the tripod head
forward<00:00:22.349> acting<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> counterbalance<00:00:23.670> for

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
forward acting as a counterbalance for

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.560 
forward acting as a counterbalance for
when<00:00:25.259> you're<00:00:25.380> spotting<00:00:25.740> scope<00:00:26.009> is<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
when you're spotting scope is on so you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.749 
when you're spotting scope is on so you
can<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.929> have<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.259> scope<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.640> all

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
can see I have the scope on here and all

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.460 
can see I have the scope on here and all
of<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> sudden<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.779> balance<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.259> tipping

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
of a sudden all the balance is tipping

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.350 
of a sudden all the balance is tipping
forward<00:00:31.940> okay<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
forward okay and so what I can do is I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
forward okay and so what I can do is I
can<00:00:36.420> mount<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:36.989> camera<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.800> even

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
can mount my camera and you can see even

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
can mount my camera and you can see even
when<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.219> tighten<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.210> bit

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
when I tighten it down a little bit

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.529 
when I tighten it down a little bit
still<00:00:39.809> wants<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> spring<00:00:40.440> forward<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.129> I

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
still wants to spring forward on me I

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.569 
still wants to spring forward on me I
can<00:00:42.539> attach<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.809> camera<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.920> digital<00:00:44.250> camera

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
can attach my camera the digital camera

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.750 
can attach my camera the digital camera
adapter<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> does<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
adapter here and what it does is it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.569 
adapter here and what it does is it
helps<00:00:47.969> mitigate<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.170> pressure<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:50.039> putting

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
helps mitigate the pressure of putting

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
helps mitigate the pressure of putting
the<00:00:50.670> camera<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> loosen<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.930> head

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the camera back if I loosen this head

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
the camera back if I loosen this head
altogether<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.340> still<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:54.059> want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> drop

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
altogether it still will want to drop

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.849 
altogether it still will want to drop
back<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.769> the

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
back a little bit and that's just the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.049 
back a little bit and that's just the
nature<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> beast<00:00:56.460> by<00:00:56.640> having<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.910> much

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
nature of the beast by having that much

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
nature of the beast by having that much
weight<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.359> high<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.109> back<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> there

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
weight that high up and back on there

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.369 
weight that high up and back on there
however<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.940> allows<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> tighten<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
however it allows me to tighten it just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.690 
however it allows me to tighten it just
a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> stay<00:01:03.390> balanced

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
a little bit and have it stay balanced

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
a little bit and have it stay balanced
if<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.850> were<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> take<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> counterbalance<00:01:06.840> off

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
if I were to take the counterbalance off

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.450 
if I were to take the counterbalance off
if<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.130> turn<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> knob<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.950> wants

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
if I turn that knob you can see it wants

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
if I turn that knob you can see it wants
to<00:01:11.549> tip<00:01:11.729> backwards<00:01:12.240> again<00:01:12.540> once<00:01:13.020> again<00:01:13.290> just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to tip backwards again once again just

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.719 
to tip backwards again once again just
by<00:01:13.590> putting<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:16.500> balances<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
by putting it on it balances it out so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
by putting it on it balances it out so
that's<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> counterbalance<00:01:18.509> works<00:01:19.460> once

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's how the counterbalance works once

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.960 
that's how the counterbalance works once
again<00:01:20.729> pulls<00:01:21.060> forward<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:23.040> head<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.729> here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
again pulls forward this head right here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
again pulls forward this head right here
is<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> bird-watching<00:01:24.630> head<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.979> one

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

it really locks it a bit more positively

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
it really locks it a bit more positively
than<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.810> 2180<00:01:46.380> heads<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.860> far<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.219> head<00:01:47.340> that

this rawski sliding balance rail so I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
this rawski sliding balance rail so I
can<00:01:56.700> put<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.619> alternative

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
can put that in there as an alternative

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.990 
can put that in there as an alternative
to<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:03.079> counterbalance<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
to the counterbalance I have this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
to the counterbalance I have this
balance<00:02:06.000> rail<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.659> where<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.110> open<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
balance rail here where I can open that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.029 
balance rail here where I can open that
lever<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.220> slide<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.990> out<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.680> once<00:02:10.890> again

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lever and slide that out and once again

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.170 
lever and slide that out and once again
mount<00:02:11.370> my<00:02:11.520> camera<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> camera

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
mount my camera at the camera

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.990 
mount my camera at the camera
on<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.989> scope<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.560> sliding<00:02:15.129> balance

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
on the scope with the sliding balance

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.759 
on the scope with the sliding balance
rail

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
rail

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.990 
rail
it's<00:02:17.769> like<00:02:17.890> slide<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.640> see<00:02:18.909> it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
it's like slide it back you can see it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.479 
it's like slide it back you can see it
wants<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.269> tip<00:02:19.390> back<00:02:19.709> slide<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.830> forward<00:02:21.040> and

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
wants to tip back slide it forward and

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.850 
wants to tip back slide it forward and
it<00:02:22.269> balances<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.200> certainly<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.830> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
it balances so this certainly is a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.899 
it balances so this certainly is a
solution<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:25.470> fixes<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:27.610> quite

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
solution that fixes this really quite

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.449 
solution that fixes this really quite
well<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.390> balance<00:02:28.780> rail<00:02:28.959> solution<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
well this balance rail solution if you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.759 
well this balance rail solution if you
don't<00:02:30.700> want<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.970> go<00:02:31.030> with<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> balance<00:02:31.540> rail

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
don't want to go with the balance rail

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.229 
don't want to go with the balance rail
between<00:02:32.769> 180<00:02:33.069> head<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.489> accommodate<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> some

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
between 180 head can accommodate to some

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.789 
between 180 head can accommodate to some
extent<00:02:34.629> although<00:02:34.870> without<00:02:35.140> tightening<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
extent although without tightening it

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.039 
extent although without tightening it
you'll<00:02:35.950> still<00:02:36.329> tip<00:02:37.329> back<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> little<00:02:37.780> bit

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
you'll still tip back a little bit

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.930 
you'll still tip back a little bit
whereas<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.829> head<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.220> fully<00:02:39.489> loose<00:02:39.700> right

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
whereas this head is fully loose right

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.699 
whereas this head is fully loose right
now<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.269> still<00:02:40.450> perfectly<00:02:40.870> balanced<00:02:41.379> just

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
now and still perfectly balanced just

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.610 
now and still perfectly balanced just
because<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.159> balance<00:02:42.459> rail<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:44.379> course

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
because of the balance rail of course

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.410 
because of the balance rail of course
you<00:02:44.769> can<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.129> balance<00:02:45.280> rail<00:02:45.609> on<00:02:45.879> both

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you can use the balance rail on both

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.440 
you can use the balance rail on both
heads<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.560> again<00:02:47.859> it<00:02:47.950> has<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> same

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
heads this again it has the same
