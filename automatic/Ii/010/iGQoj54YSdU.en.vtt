00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 xo 2 it's an electric scooter 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.570
 characterized by two great advantages 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.730
 the first thing is that it is 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.140
 folds so when we do not need it and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.929
 we do not know what to do with it 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.189
 puts it in a corner other advantage we do not 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.780
 easily puts in a car trunk 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.670
 a motorhome and above all we can 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 keep at home so no problem of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.530
 two flights degradation problems 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.180
 would have several elements of high 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.650
 technology on this gear first is a 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.840
 extremely lightweight design that him 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.880
 gives a power / weight ratio 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.650
 unmatched a fact that 83 kg for a 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.300
 very big power 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.130
 the second thing is that we put at the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.830
 point a complex of engines very 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.910
 innovative and the third point is that 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.100
 we have a very high battery 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.440
 technology both very safe to very 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.180
 high energy density the speed of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.770
 load is extremely fast since there 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.920
 we have a big battery of 4 kilowatts 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.689
 hour that allows to make 75 km to 90 to 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.030
 the time so a good autonomy and 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.649
 this battery of empty full on the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.039
 recharge in 1h20 then 100 meters starting 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.350
 stopped 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.439
 he's doing the cannon performance of six 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.329
 9 seconds for memory the best of 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.130
 125 to today is around nine 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.090
 seconds so accelerations 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.090
 extremely strong 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.509
 the top speed is around 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.909
 120 kilometers an hour so there too on 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.590
 the road we are very competitive we are going 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.329
 add some performance 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.069
 of ergonomics first of all there a radius of 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.409
 extremely tight gyration ie 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.799
 he turns around on a radius of 1 m 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.030
 40 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.890
 so when we're stuck in a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.630
 bottling behind a taxi behind 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.700
 a bus is easily released 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.659
 and then the flat floor is the most 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.799
 big flat floor that we made in 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.630
 scooter it's a quarter of a meter 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.280
 squares and on it we can even 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.259
 carry a very big bags or even a 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.469
 suitcase the center of gravity placed very 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.869
 low 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.780
 and then last thing there is a height 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.780
 sitting which is rather low for 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.340
 people who have legs not necessarily 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 adriana karembeu and well we pose very 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.549
 easily feet on the floor he has 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.769
 declined in two types of category 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.660
 the equivalent 125 the equivalent 50 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.040
 the equipment is exactly the same 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 the only thing that changes is the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 motorization between the two categories 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.700
 we are here at the headquarters of the company 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.370
 exor located in gardanne in the mouths 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.269
 du rhÃ´ne is what I can tell you 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 in the immediate future it is that I am 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.130
 really bluffed because at the base 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.220
 I had come to try to a vehicle of 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.780
 fully foldable practical leisure 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.769
 on which we can have a big 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.810
 carrying capacity a small vehicle 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.400
 ideal for holidays somehow 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.500
 on the other hand what happens when we 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.510
 turn the accelerator and here we are 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.660
 stuck by the performance of the vehicle 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.930
 the 0 100 m in less than 7 seconds a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.220
 acceleration that is really phenomenal 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.810
 it's simple on the market there is no 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.470
 of equivalence and I remind you a 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 equivalent electric scooter 125 the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.709
 performance level 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 he is before all the others without any 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.030
 problem it accelerates very hard it brakes 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.569
 very very strong and his top speed 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.250
 around 120 kilometers an hour 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.750
 when you see such a gear especially 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.810
 that they really hide his game 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.970
 we think about the limit a scooter for 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.100
 go on the beach edge to saint 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.020
 overdo things like that and besides it 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.690
 is really good xo2 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.880
 available early 2012 but given its level 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 embedded technology in my opinion one 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.440
 did not finish hearing dr
