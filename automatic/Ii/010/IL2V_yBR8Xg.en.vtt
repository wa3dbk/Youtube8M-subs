coming from Manoa in Hawaii where these
people<00:01:48.490> were<00:01:48.580> getting<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:48.850> 30<00:01:49.300> hours<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.020> sun

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
people were getting like 30 hours of sun

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.930 
people were getting like 30 hours of sun
exposure<00:01:50.620> a<00:01:50.770> week<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.220> yet<00:01:51.370> their<00:01:51.520> vitamin<00:01:51.820> D

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
exposure a week and yet their vitamin D

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.390 
exposure a week and yet their vitamin D
levels<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.420> 51%<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.440> them<00:01:53.530> vitamin<00:01:53.920> D<00:01:54.070> levels

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
levels and 51% of them vitamin D levels

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.450 
levels and 51% of them vitamin D levels
were<00:01:55.120> low<00:01:55.540> below<00:01:56.200> 30<00:01:56.530> nanograms<00:01:56.950> per<00:01:57.040> ml<00:01:57.130> so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
were low below 30 nanograms per ml so

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.330 
were low below 30 nanograms per ml so
I'm<00:01:58.330> like<00:01:58.480> wait<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> second<00:01:59.830> what's<00:01:59.980> going<00:02:00.220> on

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
I'm like wait a second what's going on

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.880 
I'm like wait a second what's going on
here<00:02:00.670> right<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:01.930> don't<00:02:02.380> absorb<00:02:02.740> it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
here right is it they don't absorb it

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.470 
here right is it they don't absorb it
from<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.160> Sun<00:02:03.490> do<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.060> some<00:02:04.270> sort<00:02:04.390> of

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
from the Sun do they have some sort of

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.720 
from the Sun do they have some sort of
genetic<00:02:04.780> variance<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.400> know<00:02:06.490> more

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
genetic variance but you know more

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.650 
genetic variance but you know more
likely<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.739> that<00:02:08.739> they<00:02:08.920> are<00:02:09.129> getting<00:02:09.879> exposed

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
likely is that they are getting exposed

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.039 
likely is that they are getting exposed
to<00:02:11.230> some<00:02:11.470> sort<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.770> chemical<00:02:12.370> that's

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
to some sort of chemical that's

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.750 
to some sort of chemical that's
activating<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.349> Pixar<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.189> dr.<00:02:15.459> Michael

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
activating this Pixar the dr. Michael

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.910 
activating this Pixar the dr. Michael
Holick<00:02:16.000> talked<00:02:16.209> about<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.719> is<00:02:16.870> Pixar

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
Holick talked about so what is Pixar

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.840 
Holick talked about so what is Pixar
well<00:02:18.220> Pixar<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.210> pregnant<00:02:20.110> ex<00:02:20.850> receptor

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
well Pixar is the pregnant ex receptor

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.620 
well Pixar is the pregnant ex receptor
and<00:02:22.290> what<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.500> does<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.819> sits<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.510> your

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and what this does is it sits on your

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.130 
and what this does is it sits on your
DNA<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:27.940> activated<00:02:28.780> by<00:02:28.810> certain

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
DNA and when it's activated by certain

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.990 
DNA and when it's activated by certain
constituents<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.160> original<00:02:30.490> research<00:02:30.790> as

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
constituents in the original research as

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.540 
constituents in the original research as
you<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:32.290> done<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.680> medication

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you see here was done on medication

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.340 
you see here was done on medication
anti-seizure<00:02:34.120> type<00:02:34.480> medication<00:02:35.020> was<00:02:35.110> really

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
anti-seizure type medication was really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.949 
anti-seizure type medication was really
strongly<00:02:35.950> associated<00:02:36.730> with<00:02:36.880> activating<00:02:37.840> this

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.070 
strongly associated with activating this
receptor<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.700> then<00:02:39.700> breaking<00:02:40.209> down<00:02:40.720> your

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
receptor and then breaking down your

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.230 
receptor and then breaking down your
vitamin<00:02:41.470> D<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> by<00:02:42.520> breaking<00:02:42.760> down<00:02:42.910> your

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
vitamin D and by breaking down your

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.390 
vitamin D and by breaking down your
vitamin<00:02:43.570> D<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> mean<00:02:43.900> normally<00:02:44.890> we<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.040> these

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400

the D all of a sudden you'll all longer

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.180 
the D all of a sudden you'll all longer
have<00:03:30.549> active<00:03:31.090> vitamin<00:03:31.299> D<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.890> starts

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
have active vitamin D so it starts

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.440 
have active vitamin D so it starts
degrading<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:34.060> D<00:03:34.329> in<00:03:34.600> your<00:03:34.630> body<00:03:35.140> ah<00:03:36.450> what

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:21.999 
through your skin BPA is everywhere you

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:25.739 
through your skin BPA is everywhere you
know<00:06:22.119> it<00:06:22.389> it's<00:06:23.319> about<00:06:23.439> 50%<00:06:24.249> of<00:06:24.999> your<00:06:25.119> daily<00:06:25.329> BPA

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:25.749 
know it it's about 50% of your daily BPA

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:28.319 
know it it's about 50% of your daily BPA
is<00:06:25.839> going<00:06:25.989> to<00:06:26.049> come<00:06:26.199> from<00:06:26.349> packaged<00:06:26.979> foods<00:06:27.339> so

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:28.329 
is going to come from packaged foods so

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:30.089 
is going to come from packaged foods so
eating<00:06:28.539> fresher<00:06:28.959> foods<00:06:29.349> will<00:06:29.619> reduce<00:06:29.979> your

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
eating fresher foods will reduce your

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.189 
eating fresher foods will reduce your
exposure<00:06:30.429> but<00:06:31.329> guess<00:06:31.539> what<00:06:31.749> the<00:06:31.869> research<00:06:32.169> is

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
exposure but guess what the research is

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.100 
exposure but guess what the research is
showing<00:06:32.549> it's<00:06:33.549> showing<00:06:33.819> that<00:06:33.969> BPA<00:06:34.599> is<00:06:34.869> a

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
showing it's showing that BPA is a

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.449 
showing it's showing that BPA is a

on rats but look at these 2014 articles

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.000 
on rats but look at these 2014 articles
they're<00:07:04.820> showing<00:07:05.390> us<00:07:05.570> that<00:07:06.290> the<00:07:06.440> rats<00:07:06.740> don't

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
they're showing us that the rats don't

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.160 
they're showing us that the rats don't
have<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.370> same<00:07:07.520> effects<00:07:07.820> humans<00:07:08.720> have<00:07:08.900> huge
