00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
most of the people I think had the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
most of the people I think had the
mindset<00:00:31.919> that<00:00:31.950> this<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.240> gonna<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mindset that this was just gonna be a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010 
mindset that this was just gonna be a
hobby<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.490> be<00:00:36.020> something

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
hobby this was just gonna be something

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
hobby this was just gonna be something
that's<00:00:37.350> gonna<00:00:37.590> fade<00:00:37.860> away<00:00:38.130> with<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.880> but

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that's gonna fade away with time but but

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.170 
that's gonna fade away with time but but
I<00:00:39.720> think<00:00:39.990> as<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.890> grew<00:00:41.700> older<00:00:41.730> we

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I think as we as we grew older we

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.900 
I think as we as we grew older we
realize<00:00:42.690> how<00:00:43.110> much<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:43.470> we<00:00:43.650> love<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.700> do

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
realize how much more we love what we do

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.849 
realize how much more we love what we do
and<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.239> much<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:45.960> sacrifice<00:00:46.590> for

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
and how much more we will sacrifice for

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:47.270 
and how much more we will sacrifice for
it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it

it
black<00:00:48.059> ice<00:00:48.239> crews<00:00:48.510> started<00:00:49.109> in<00:00:49.289> 2008<00:00:50.129> we

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
black ice crews started in 2008 we

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.910 
black ice crews started in 2008 we
stumbled<00:00:51.000> across<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.270> few<00:00:51.539> videos<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
stumbled across a few videos and then we

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
stumbled across a few videos and then we
we<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> drew<00:00:53.969> inspiration<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.629> those

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
we kind of drew inspiration from those

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.099 
we kind of drew inspiration from those
videos<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:56.640> said<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.359> try<00:00:57.600> doing<00:00:57.660> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
videos and we said we can try doing this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
videos and we said we can try doing this
but<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> impossible<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
but it's kind of impossible I think that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
but it's kind of impossible I think that
Battle<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> year<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.859> brought<00:01:02.399> us<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.760> lot

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
Battle of year actually brought us a lot

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
Battle of year actually brought us a lot
closer<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:03.719> other<00:01:03.929> because<00:01:04.220> there<00:01:05.220> was

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
closer to each other because there was

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
closer to each other because there was
more<00:01:05.489> dedication<00:01:05.970> practice<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.560> were

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
