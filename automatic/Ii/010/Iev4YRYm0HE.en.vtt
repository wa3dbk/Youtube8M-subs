The  cheap experience by Dr Nozman

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.620
Hello everyone and welcome in this new cheap experience

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.920
I think there is a lot of Game Of Throne fans here and you're going to be happy

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.500
because we are going to make beautiful dragon eggs

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.380
Like Khaleesi's one

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.200
Thank you Nozman

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.800
You're welcome

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.460
Don't forget to like this video if you like it and to share it on social medias

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.340
Thanks everyone and good experience

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.900
For this nice egg dragon, we'll need

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.000
Some black paint and another colour which will be the colour you want for your egg

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.120
A couple of brushes

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.400
A polystyrene egg of 10,12 or 20 cm, anyway you want

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.360
And tacks, think big so I advise you to buy them by 1x1000 directly and not doing like me

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.160
if you know what I mean

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.120
This tutorial is extremely simple but the result is really sympathetic, I love this

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.540
Oh, yes

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.400
Firstly, I'll take my pre-cut polystyrene egg

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.780
I specify that I use a 20cm egg to really have a big object and not just some old hen egg

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.200
No, this is some nice egg here

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.420
Anyway, I'll put the two parts together and stick them with Super Glue

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
I let it dry approx ten minutes, normal

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.940
And then I put the stacks which are going to make the 'scale' look on the surface of the egg

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.520
To have this overlapping scale look, you really have to start putting the stacks at the bottom of the egg

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.520
and get back while always putting the stacks 2mm above the ones from the row above (under in fact)

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.320
Got it ?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.200
This way, every stack will overlap the other,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.160
so you have to put them in line and go back up little by little while keeping the line straight

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.480
Let's go !

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.200
In this phase, you can sing to give you a little bit of  motivation

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.720
Once covered like this, take your black paint

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.120
your brush and let's put a fine layer of black paint

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.640
Take your time to put everywhere, so that there is no trace of white polystyrene

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.400
Once the black sublayer put, you have to let it dry and put another another black layer

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.440
It's very important !

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.280
And once this new layer of black paint is dry, you can put the ultimate layer

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.840
which means the colour you want for your dragon's egg

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.200
For my part, I choose green

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.180
Green is nice

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.560
And for a really good result, you have to use the dry brushing way

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.960
I like the dry brushing

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.800
It means that your brush has to be completely dry with a minimum of green paint on it

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.740
And then you brush your egg to add a natural green colour on it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.840
It will add a very realistic and particularly nice shine to your dragon's egg

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.360
Once the second layer of paint put, let your egg dry for a few hours before handling it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.960
Once completely dry, you can handle, put it wherever you want

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.140
even hatch it if you think that a dragon can come out

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.020
So what ?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.560
Yes, voila, voila

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.420

Wait, before you leave I have a good news for you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.240
I just opened a T-shirt shop with a lot of models already available that I designed myself with my little hands

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300
Of course I will add models in the next days

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.720
there is for everybody and every taste

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.100
