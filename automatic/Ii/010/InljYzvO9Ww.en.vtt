00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
chances are we will be doing at least a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
chances are we will be doing at least a
bare<00:01:16.740> minimum<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.810> video<00:01:19.110> per<00:01:19.380> week<00:01:20.390> more

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
bare minimum of one video per week more
than<00:01:21.509> likely<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.710> record<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
