00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 of my channel with you again indicated 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.250
 gotta tell but I'm confused already 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.330
 time again night I'm trying to talk about 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.130
 the fact that yesterday I did in minecraft 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.820
 that is, built the world but again 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.679
 speak the table and while i'm flying i will 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.219
 probably talk all sorts of nonsense and glow 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.770
 In short, think she's cured I'm where I'm from 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.579
 and there we are with garin and we found a place for 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 new town 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 so now the world of progress has found a place for 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.879
 new town on that place is quite 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 good so now poisonous source 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.370
 beautiful in fact I found one place 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.010
 garena man nearby is different but i think 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 if we do really huge 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 the city then we will connect these two cities 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 different in architecture because Ukraine 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 we are at 1 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 my architecture is different shortened 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.990
 limit coordinate remember x somewhere in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.950
 a district of 100 games and z in the region of 500 which 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.570
 come on let the world go out that not even 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.960
 want to fall man but when you have to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 the main thing 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 shorter body model time night complexity 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:39.000
 dimensional 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 and this is a loner company so but essentially 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 with perry 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 all worlds of saves 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.250
 actually servers with her alone do not 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.840
 Preserved houses this part of the houses 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.050
 built a lot don't give 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.830
 preserved okay figs with them build more 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 time at leisure 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.619
 bridges now de by the way air bridges in 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.030
 air area as you see now 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.360
 arched beautiful such 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.550
 but at least I like friends 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.550
 how to say accounting suspension bridges 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.250
 which like these 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.520
 like in the mountains and you know such suspended 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 bridges concave it's convex i'm there 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.670
 concave so here it turns out go 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.310
 this is how happy smiley oh dissatisfied 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.379
 smiley there as she is pleased here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 bridges they like to make and suspended 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.920
 more realistic there but given that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.800
 I remembered a physics lesson on account of such 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.890
 bridges such bridges judging 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.170
 In general, well, in short, such bridges should 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.590
 carry more weight 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.290
 they should be stronger 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.080
 according to the logic of things from the laws of physics but 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.590
 again, again, again , let's say that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.599
 maykravt built all the houses 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.670
 as you might have noticed again on 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.530
 stamped houses but I say not 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.110
 I use no programs and I will do everything 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.500
 manually , well, except for the command block 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.640
 which teleports me there over there 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.450
 send underground 3g vanderbolt or 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:34.720
 underworld regge another world 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:34.720
 Gagarin we are in the hands of the theater enter we are here 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.470
 I do not remember this house like I showed 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.120
 Well, in short, we built the houses on 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 tanned and we mastic slightly 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.420
 improved the lower level began to build 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.519
 here we have the type of miners guild 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.160
 because it is a clumsy pickaxe created 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.660
 confident and we pickaxe here is good 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.180
 a separate room is not just not yet 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.359
 built so blanks will still call 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.130
 Garen she is not all equip well and 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.490
 actually i built mine spent it to 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.020
 we 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.760
 eat said while we ride i something yes 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.760
 on the stove to you that's what basically 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.940
 I plan to make food in the underground but 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.200
 nothing about that nothing can be shoved there 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:33.080
 by the way right the water seems to florida 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.600
 they are still doing all sorts of games there 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.250
 wonderful 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.370
 I'll finish these islets will still not do 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.850
 such stamped as if more 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.560
 as diverse as the first island itself 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.560
 so everybody drop me off 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.810
 so it came 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.210
 just shook a friend was not the world not yet 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.210
 progruzilas mind low will work in 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.880
 boot I went out do not turn off and I think 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.500
 very much in vain by me as I said in 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.970
 the last podcast I have a virus in my computer 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.090
 wound up so everything is like this 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.810
 terrible in short let's go though 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.280
 got up dug shorter than the old mine she 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.910
 very big not even once 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.520
 got lost I had to dig my way up 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:30.700
 Well, on what I actually did 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:34.150
 work with boys, well, speak to the cop 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:39.250
 exactly participated the press like not if 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.740
 honestly point out both in the comments with you 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.750
 channel was hoping you this here and 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.790
 like it will keep looking 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.200
 it's interesting at least 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:54.760
 the work done friends still claim 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.680
 a dream is a type they will not believe that the world is well 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.320
 that this city I myself asked not 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.250
 downloaded measures from there if someone 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.910
 the same opinion can arise even 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.340
 search the world is called kingdoms 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.300
 rename i don't know how 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.160
 Here, but it is unlikely that if the folder is changed a 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.260
 folder rename hardly 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.300
 renamed the world I'm not sure at 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.300
 extent, yes and I did not climb things I think 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.210
 that I would not want the server to shout 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:30.400
 Xia on the gamer open this world really 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:33.220
 made by me did he here again 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.479
 I repeat as in the first video where else 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.400
 screenshots were to say that I made 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.210
 when i got the internet off 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.070
 in December 2012 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.550
 But now I decided to return to it and 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.530
 finish it home all with you was the channel 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.120
 subscribe comment comment like 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.560
 hope you all like it 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.560
 interesting enough for all
