of the issues with this game on some
gaming<00:00:19.109> laptops<00:00:19.710> I've<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> run<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.520> the

order<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> able<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.789> play<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:29.970> title<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
order to be able to play the title and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.319 
order to be able to play the title and
this<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.489> some<00:00:32.790> impact<00:00:32.820> on

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this will have some impact on

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
this will have some impact on
performance<00:00:33.450> potentially<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.030> can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
performance potentially but as you can

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.410 
performance potentially but as you can
see<00:00:36.450> we're<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.260> having<00:00:38.010> tested<00:00:38.790> previously

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
see we're now having tested previously

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.819 
see we're now having tested previously
on<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.899> iris<00:00:40.230> 5100<00:00:40.879> HD<00:00:42.050> 5500<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> GTA

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
on things like iris 5100 HD 5500 and GTA

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
on things like iris 5100 HD 5500 and GTA
20m<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.420> were<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.809> too<00:00:46.320> slow<00:00:46.649> i

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
20m all of which were really too slow i

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
20m all of which were really too slow i
think<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> fastest<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.760> those<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.180> averaging

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
think the fastest of those was averaging

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.220 
think the fastest of those was averaging
about<00:00:48.870> 14<00:00:49.559> 15<00:00:50.010> frames<00:00:50.460> per<00:00:50.610> second<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
about 14 15 frames per second and now

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
about 14 15 frames per second and now
we're<00:00:52.530> getting<00:00:52.949> into<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.460> realms<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
we're getting into the realms of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.799 
we're getting into the realms of
playability<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.680> still<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.550> too<00:00:57.390> slow

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
playability it's still really too slow

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.160 
playability it's still really too slow
to<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:58.230> ideal<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.969> we're<00:00:59.969> through<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> test

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to be ideal and we're through this test

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
to be ideal and we're through this test
i<00:01:01.320> believe<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.680> average<00:01:01.980> about<00:01:02.129> 20<00:01:02.640> frames<00:01:02.820> per

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
i believe we average about 20 frames per

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
i believe we average about 20 frames per
second<00:01:03.480> by<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> end<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.680> obviously

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
second by the end which is obviously

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.390 
second by the end which is obviously
lower<00:01:05.309> than<00:01:05.640> we'd<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.400> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
lower than we'd like to see and but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
lower than we'd like to see and but
overall<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.680> desperate<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
overall if you're really desperate to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
overall if you're really desperate to
play<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.880> game<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.540> you've<00:01:12.720> got<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.140> geforce
