00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.789 
old cap on so we don't drop anything in
the<00:03:21.549> engine<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:23.019> where<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.530> spark

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the engine and this is where the spark

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.110 
the engine and this is where the spark
plugs<00:03:24.099> off<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.239> model<00:03:25.569> this<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:27.120> 2004

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
2005 the other ones that are almost

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.619 
2005 the other ones that are almost
identical

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
identical

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.990

right here like that and that's where

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.199 
right here like that and that's where
the<00:03:44.650> spark<00:03:44.950> plugs<00:03:45.250> are<00:03:45.549> right<00:03:45.819> there<00:03:46.000> so

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
the spark plugs are right there so

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.759 
the spark plugs are right there so
that's<00:03:46.359> how<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.629> replace<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.200> spark<00:03:47.410> plugs

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
that's how you replace the spark plugs

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:56.000 
that's how you replace the spark plugs

third cylinder and fourth and since
there<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.169> two<00:04:45.530> grounds<00:04:46.099> that<00:04:46.340> we<00:04:46.490> need<00:04:46.639> to

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
there is two grounds that we need to

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.040 
there is two grounds that we need to
take<00:04:46.910> off<00:04:47.150> with<00:04:47.360> eight<00:04:47.509> millimeter<00:04:47.960> socket

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
because underneath it is a bowl that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.930 
because underneath it is a bowl that
holds<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.440> valve<00:04:51.650> cover<00:04:51.949> to<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.789> the
