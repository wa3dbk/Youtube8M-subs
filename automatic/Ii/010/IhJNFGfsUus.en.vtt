hey<00:00:01.170> guys<00:00:01.350> today<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> show<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.639> how

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey guys today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.850> use<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.149> such<00:00:03.300> huge<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.810> know<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.710> are

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to use the such huge I know you are

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.400 
to use the such huge I know you are
thinking<00:00:04.830> then<00:00:05.700> how<00:00:06.330> could<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
thinking then how could it be to use the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.950 
thinking then how could it be to use the
centrifuge<00:00:07.859> well<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.780> show<00:00:09.929> you

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
centrifuge well I'm going to show you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.720 
centrifuge well I'm going to show you
some<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> commonly<00:00:10.740> make<00:00:10.950> mistakes<00:00:19.730> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
some of the commonly make mistakes this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.890 
some of the commonly make mistakes this
is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.000> standard<00:00:21.660> tabletop<00:00:22.140> centrifuge<00:00:23.900> here

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
is a standard tabletop centrifuge here

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.750 
is a standard tabletop centrifuge here
is<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> temperature<00:00:25.859> control<00:00:26.250> tabletop

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
is a temperature control tabletop

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720 
is a temperature control tabletop
temperature<00:00:27.150> food

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.100 

so<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:31.910> is<00:00:32.060> a<00:00:32.090> bigger<00:00:32.390> centrifuge<00:00:32.900> for

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
so this is a bigger centrifuge for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.780 
so this is a bigger centrifuge for
bigger<00:00:33.350> tubes<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:37.040> is<00:00:37.220> not<00:00:37.400> a<00:00:37.430> washing

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
bigger tubes this is not a washing

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.010 
bigger tubes this is not a washing
machine<00:00:38.060> it's<00:00:38.239> actually<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.570> high-speed

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
machine it's actually a high-speed

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.090 
machine it's actually a high-speed
centrifuge

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.660 

you<00:00:42.610> don't<00:00:42.880> mess<00:00:43.060> with<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:44.250> no<00:00:45.250> matter<00:00:45.460> which

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
you don't mess with it no matter which

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670 
you don't mess with it no matter which
centrifuge<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.420> use<00:00:46.600> there<00:00:47.380> are<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.500> few

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
centrifuge you use there are a few

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.590 
centrifuge you use there are a few
things<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:48.100> need<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.280> remember<00:00:48.490> the<00:00:49.360> first

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
things you need to remember the first

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.790 
things you need to remember the first
thing<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.870> need<00:00:49.990> to<00:00:50.110> know<00:00:50.260> when<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.530> use<00:00:50.620> the

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
thing you need to know when you use the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.560 
thing you need to know when you use the
centrifuge<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.790> make<00:00:51.940> sure<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.240> use<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
centrifuge is to make sure you use the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.440 
centrifuge is to make sure you use the
right<00:00:52.810> size<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.410> tube<00:00:54.250> with<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:54.940> right

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
right size of tube with the right

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.410 
centrifuge here is a commonly used 1.5
mil<00:00:59.050> microfuge<00:00:59.590> tube<00:00:59.650> that<00:01:00.130> fits<00:01:00.700> in<00:01:00.910> most<00:01:01.239> of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
mil microfuge tube that fits in most of

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.590 
mil microfuge tube that fits in most of
the<00:01:01.630> tabletop<00:01:02.470> centrifuge<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:04.120> is<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.270> half

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the tabletop centrifuge here is a half

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.110 
the tabletop centrifuge here is a half
mil<00:01:04.870> of<00:01:05.080> microfuge<00:01:06.010> tube<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.460> will<00:01:06.610> also<00:01:06.790> fit

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
mil of microfuge tube that will also fit

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.990 
mil of microfuge tube that will also fit
into<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.660> centrifuge<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:09.070> if<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.580> use<00:01:09.760> this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
into the centrifuge but if you use this

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.800 
into the centrifuge but if you use this
one<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.780> will<00:01:10.900> have<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.170> use<00:01:11.320> an<00:01:11.470> adapter<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
one you will have to use an adapter so

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510 
one you will have to use an adapter so
you<00:01:13.870> place<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.410> an<00:01:14.530> adapter<00:01:14.920> like<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.280> and

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
you place it in an adapter like that and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.499 
you place it in an adapter like that and
use<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.729> if<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.300> don't<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.380> tube<00:01:17.619> might<00:01:17.830> break

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
use it if you don't the tube might break

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.609 
use it if you don't the tube might break
the<00:01:19.509> second<00:01:19.840> thing<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.110> need<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.320> watch<00:01:20.500> out

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the second thing you need to watch out

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.300 
the second thing you need to watch out
for<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.640> have<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.060> balance<00:01:22.270> your<00:01:22.840> tubes<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
for is you have to balance your tubes so

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.150 
for is you have to balance your tubes so
here<00:01:25.090> since<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.869> volume<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:26.800> put<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
here since the volume you can put in the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.460 
here since the volume you can put in the
tube<00:01:27.340> -<00:01:27.490> small<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.930> don't<00:01:29.110> have<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.320> weigh

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
tube - small so you don't have to weigh

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.469 
tube - small so you don't have to weigh
them<00:01:29.650> all<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:30.040> have<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.550> do<00:01:30.670> is<00:01:30.820> make<00:01:31.030> sure<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
them all you have to do is make sure the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.749 
them all you have to do is make sure the
solution<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.500> two<00:01:32.650> tubes<00:01:32.890> at<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> same

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
solution in the two tubes at the same

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.969 
solution in the two tubes at the same
level<00:01:34.119> as<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:34.960> see<00:01:35.110> now<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.350> tubes<00:01:35.800> are

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
level as you can see now the tubes are

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.650 
level as you can see now the tubes are
not<00:01:36.130> balanced<00:01:36.550> one<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.330> them<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.570> that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
not balanced one of them is that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.480 
not balanced one of them is that
approximately<00:01:38.259> one<00:01:38.590> mil<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.950> other<00:01:39.070> ones<00:01:39.310> at

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
approximately one mil the other ones at

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.969 
approximately one mil the other ones at
half<00:01:39.700> mil<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.110> order<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> thousands<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.800> one

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
half mil so in order to thousands of one

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.249 
half mil so in order to thousands of one
mil<00:01:42.160> tube<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.970> should<00:01:43.210> have<00:01:43.360> an<00:01:43.600> attitude

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
mil tube you should have an attitude

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.250 
mil tube you should have an attitude
which<00:01:45.130> also<00:01:45.430> has<00:01:45.910> one<00:01:46.270> mil<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.630> solution<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.140> it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
which also has one mil of solution in it

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.790 
which also has one mil of solution in it
like<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:48.300> now<00:01:49.300> I'm<00:01:49.540> going<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.870> show<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.110> how

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
like that now I'm going to show you how

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.560 
like that now I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:50.860> balance<00:01:51.190> your<00:01:51.790> samples<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.479> the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
to balance your samples in the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.800 
to balance your samples in the
centrifuge<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:54.490> are<00:01:54.550> looking<00:01:55.210> at<00:01:55.750> a

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
centrifuge we are looking at a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.350 
centrifuge we are looking at a
centrifuge<00:01:56.380> rotor<00:01:56.650> right<00:01:56.860> now<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.940> have<00:01:58.210> to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
centrifuge rotor right now you have to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.580 
centrifuge rotor right now you have to
place<00:01:58.630> your<00:01:59.380> sample<00:02:00.390> directly<00:02:01.500> across<00:02:02.500> from

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
place your sample directly across from

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.490 
place your sample directly across from
each<00:02:02.920> other<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.120> balance<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.690> if

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
each other that's how you balance it if

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.430 
each other that's how you balance it if
you<00:02:05.680> only<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.040> one<00:02:06.280> sample<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.110> take<00:02:08.320> a

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
you only have one sample you can take a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.710 
you only have one sample you can take a
second<00:02:08.950> centrifuge<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:10.269> fill<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:10.630> up

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
second centrifuge to just fill it up

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.990 
second centrifuge to just fill it up
with<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.959> same<00:02:11.290> volume<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.950> water<00:02:12.250> then<00:02:12.880> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
with the same volume of water then you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.289 
with the same volume of water then you
will<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.269> your<00:02:13.750> centrifuge<00:02:14.110> balanced<00:02:15.299> the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
will have your centrifuge balanced the

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.400 
will have your centrifuge balanced the
third<00:02:16.510> thing<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.720> need<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.140> when<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.380> use

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
third thing you need to do when you use

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.620 
third thing you need to do when you use
a<00:02:17.500> centrifuge<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.910> always<00:02:19.269> have<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
a centrifuge is that you always have to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.039 
a centrifuge is that you always have to
secure<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.709> rotor<00:02:20.950> lid<00:02:21.280> onto<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.299> rotor<00:02:22.510> like

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
secure the rotor lid onto the rotor like

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.530 
secure the rotor lid onto the rotor like
that<00:02:23.290> make<00:02:23.739> sure<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.100> secured<00:02:24.519> then<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.360> can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
that make sure it's secured then you can

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.990 
that make sure it's secured then you can
close<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.900> interview

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
close this interview

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.420 
close this interview
the<00:02:28.480> last<00:02:28.720> thing<00:02:28.960> we<00:02:29.290> need<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.530> check<00:02:29.740> before

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the last thing we need to check before

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.970 
the last thing we need to check before
we<00:02:30.520> use<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.880> centrifuge<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.710> check<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
we use the centrifuge is to check the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.670 
we use the centrifuge is to check the
setting<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.870> usually<00:02:35.200> two<00:02:35.320> settings

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
setting they are usually two settings

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.330 
setting they are usually two settings
one<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.460> time<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.420> other<00:02:37.570> one<00:02:37.780> speed<00:02:38.340> time

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
one is time the other one speed time

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.000 
one is time the other one speed time
isn't<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.330> important<00:02:41.050> here<00:02:41.500> but

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
isn't really that important here but

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.370 
isn't really that important here but
what's<00:02:42.250> most<00:02:42.490> important<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> speed<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
what's most important is the speed you

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.960 
what's most important is the speed you
want<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.650> make<00:02:44.800> sure<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> centrifuge<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.730> set

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
want to make sure the centrifuge is set

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.880 
want to make sure the centrifuge is set
at<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> speed<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:47.080> not<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.710> break

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
at a speed that is not going to break

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.090 
at a speed that is not going to break
the<00:02:47.950> tube<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:50.560> how<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:50.800> use<00:02:50.980> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
the tube that's how you use the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.460 
the tube that's how you use the
centrifuge<00:02:51.580> just<00:02:52.360> remember<00:02:52.720> always<00:02:52.960> use<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
centrifuge just remember always use the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.680 
centrifuge just remember always use the
right<00:02:53.650> tube<00:02:54.000> properly<00:02:55.000> balance<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.360> sample

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
right tube properly balance on sample

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.320 
right tube properly balance on sample
secure<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.740> roller<00:02:56.950> lid<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.430> use<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.940> recipe

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
secure the roller lid and use the recipe

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.480 
secure the roller lid and use the recipe
if<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:59.110> follow<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.560> steps<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.280> should<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
if you follow these steps you should be

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.210 
if you follow these steps you should be
fine<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.420> if<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.600> don't<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.709> secretary

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
fine but if you don't the secretary

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.680 
fine but if you don't the secretary
could<00:03:03.580> explode<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.920> happened<00:03:06.280> before

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
could explode what it's happened before

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:16.010 
could explode what it's happened before
see<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.780> guys<00:03:07.900> next<00:03:08.050> time
