 if I go and is to bring more banks and to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 but it's a very useful blog it's kind of a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 multiplication glitch even exists 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.109
 a bug that you can multiply your 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.600
 even and you will need two or 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 more of these items is the touch with 10 o 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770
 within yourself because that 10 is a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.079
 Legal number I want, I want, I want 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.610
