is mold and that's caused by the
condensation<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.490> moisture<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.799> you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
condensation the moisture that if you

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.249 
condensation the moisture that if you
can<00:02:00.429> see<00:02:00.700> I'm<00:02:00.909> sure<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.390> guys<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.630> see<00:02:01.899> that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
because I can see it on the camera

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.639 
because I can see it on the camera
that's<00:02:04.420> all<00:02:04.630> moisture<00:02:04.899> dripping<00:02:05.469> down<00:02:05.590> from

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
that's all moisture dripping down from

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.040 
that's all moisture dripping down from
my<00:02:05.979> windows<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.090> problem<00:02:07.509> is<00:02:07.689> is<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:07.899> i

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
my windows and the problem is is that i

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.620 
my windows and the problem is is that i
don't<00:02:08.259> have<00:02:08.320> enough<00:02:08.649> air<00:02:08.920> flow<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:13.210> it's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
don't have enough air flow so and it's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.670 
don't have enough air flow so and it's
just<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.890> was<00:02:15.040> too<00:02:15.220> cold<00:02:15.460> it's<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:16.500> too<00:02:17.500> much

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
just it was too cold it's it's too much

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.430 
just it was too cold it's it's too much
moisture<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.280> air<00:02:18.310> basically<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.840> that's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
moisture in the air basically so that's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.230 
moisture in the air basically so that's
what<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:21.040> am<00:02:21.190> fighting<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.909> am

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
mold come through is right there at the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.910 
mold come through is right there at the
base<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.730> floor<00:03:49.590> we're<00:03:50.590> pretty

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
base of you know the floor we're pretty

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.910 
base of you know the floor we're pretty
much<00:03:51.070> all<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.370> water<00:03:51.660> seeps<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.260> that's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
much all the water seeps out so that's

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680 
much all the water seeps out so that's
what's<00:03:54.160> happening<00:03:54.550> basically<00:03:55.270> i<00:03:55.300> think<00:03:55.570> i'm

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
what's happening basically i think i'm

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.200 
what's happening basically i think i'm
willing<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.200> find<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.560> way<00:03:56.710> to<00:03:56.940> soak<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.150> up

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
willing to find a way to soak that up

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.650 
willing to find a way to soak that up
that<00:03:58.690> way<00:03:58.870> if<00:03:59.460> anything<00:04:00.460> molds<00:04:01.090> at<00:04:01.210> least<00:04:01.420> it's

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
that way if anything molds at least it's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.990 
that way if anything molds at least it's
maybe<00:04:01.960> a<00:04:02.050> towel<00:04:02.380> along<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.280> end<00:04:03.400> there<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
maybe a towel along the end there that

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000 
maybe a towel along the end there that
way<00:04:04.150> i<00:04:04.210> can<00:04:04.240> just<00:04:04.570> take<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.080> towel<00:04:05.410> out<00:04:05.440> wash

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
way i can just take the towel out wash

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.070 
way i can just take the towel out wash
it<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.430> put<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.180> back<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.720> sort<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:07.990> thing

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
it and put it back that sort of thing

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.660 
it and put it back that sort of thing
because<00:04:08.350> that's<00:04:08.680> really<00:04:08.890> inconvenient

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
because that's really inconvenient

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.080 
because that's really inconvenient
that's<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.090> pain<00:04:10.300> in<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.450> butt<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.190> i<00:04:12.190> just<00:04:12.910> i
