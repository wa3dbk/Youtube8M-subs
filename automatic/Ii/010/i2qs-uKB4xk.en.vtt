 fishing can say it we have set 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.299
 on the stove and a good warm up here can be seen on 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.990
 there was smoke 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.819
 send here 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:18.150

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.270
 salad around we leave it for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 languor 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.650
 lard and turn not let 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.500
 roasted enough we will turn it over 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.410
 on the other side here until vytaplivaem 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.600
 our fat we ground our ribs on 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.310
 such are our portions here 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.730
 pieces of bacon 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.269
 perfectly gave fat and now we can 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.090
 slightly prevent you more mid evenly 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.799
 marveled at our cracklings 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.940
 if you have a question why should we 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.190
 so much fat 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.260
 I'll tell you what fat holds better 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.799
 temperature distributes us the temperature 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.920
 the entire length of our ribs that is 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.370
 if we threw the scan into the cauldron right away without 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 fat 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.090
 the tubules would get so nasty 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.760
 crust and uneven fry so 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.880
 that fat will give us a uniform roast 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.690
 ribs along the entire length and since we 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.840
 see our cracklings excellent 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.989
 got red 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.030
 here is such a golden color can 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.019
 say they did their job 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 and now mine extracted by skimmer in 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.380
 other dishes 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.010
 now you can sprinkle them a little 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.890
 stand excellent snack will be under 40 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.720

 we lower our ribs and we need 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.769
 will mix them very quickly 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.769
 shuffle so we will be minutes 4 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.000
 here three or four minutes later 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:26.960
 it's time to add some salt to ours 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.180
 ribs add some answers there 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.199
 and already at this stage 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.410
 she adds in contact with the red-hot 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.320
 fat and that is your flavor 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.660

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.660

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.390
