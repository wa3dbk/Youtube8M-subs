you just got rubber bands at home you
can<00:00:42.120> simulate<00:00:42.540> something<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> home

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
can simulate something like this at home

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
can simulate something like this at home
for<00:00:44.040> entry<00:00:44.579> level<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.270> even<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.780> pretty

for entry level and even can get pretty

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
for entry level and even can get pretty
intense<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.940> average<00:00:47.940> experience<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> even

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
intense for average experience and even

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
intense for average experience and even
advanced<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.829> myself<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> bands
