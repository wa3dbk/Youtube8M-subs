weapons<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.530> I've<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.540> it's<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
weapons that I've got and it's just it's

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
weapons that I've got and it's just it's
absolutely<00:01:55.619> unbelievable<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> does<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
absolutely unbelievable what it does to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.929 
absolutely unbelievable what it does to
every<00:01:56.969> gun<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> adds<00:01:57.829> amp<00:01:58.829> damage<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.549> every

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
every gun is it adds amp damage to every

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
every gun is it adds amp damage to every
bullet<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.360> comes<00:02:00.540> any<00:02:00.719> gun<00:02:01.020> while<00:02:01.259> your

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
bullet that comes any gun while your

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
bullet that comes any gun while your
shield<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.009> full<00:02:02.280> health<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.610> i<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.990> using<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
shield is full health so i was using a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
shield is full health so i was using a
shotgun<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> does<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.729> x

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
shotgun just then i think it does like x

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
shotgun just then i think it does like x
14<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.020> round<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.680> every<00:02:08.429> shots<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.940> four

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
14 in the round so every shots got four

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.449 
14 in the round so every shots got four
teeth<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.660> every<00:02:10.050> bullet<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.560> 40,000<00:02:11.280> added

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
teeth out every bullet has 40,000 added

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.660 
teeth out every bullet has 40,000 added
to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.630 
to
so<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.000> 40,000<00:02:12.750> times<00:02:12.870> 14<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.830> there's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
so it's like 40,000 times 14 so there's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.360 
so it's like 40,000 times 14 so there's
a<00:02:14.760> two<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.200> shields<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.739> ones<00:02:16.950> I'll<00:02:17.160> for

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
a two to be shields there ones I'll for

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
a two to be shields there ones I'll for
yet<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> one's<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.120> 50<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.930> there

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
yet and you one's a little 50 and there

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.390 
yet and you one's a little 50 and there
is<00:02:19.380> obviously<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.890> massive<00:02:20.220> difference

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
is obviously a massive difference

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
is obviously a massive difference
between<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> old<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.660> 40,000<00:02:22.319> amp

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
damage the new one those 50,000 half

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180 
damage the new one those 50,000 half
damage<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.840> everything<00:02:25.290> else<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.680> better<00:02:25.980> as

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
damage and everything else is better as

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.180 
damage and everything else is better as
you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> let's<00:02:28.230> zoom<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
you can see so let's zoom in here and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.430 
you can see so let's zoom in here and
have<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> look<00:02:30.110> there<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.290> we've<00:02:31.410> got

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
have a look there you go we've got

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.979 
have a look there you go we've got
22,000<00:02:32.190> capacity<00:02:32.550> 24,000<00:02:33.300> recharge<00:02:33.660> rate<00:02:33.810> so

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
22,000 capacity 24,000 recharge rate so

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.420 
22,000 capacity 24,000 recharge rate so
it's<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.230> going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> recharge<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.160> about

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
it's really going to recharge in about

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's really going to recharge in about
one<00:02:35.640> second<00:02:36.120> once<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.390> gets<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.920> recharge

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
one second once it gets there recharge

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.979 
one second once it gets there recharge
layers<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.700> five<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> half<00:02:39.150> seconds<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
layers for five and a half seconds and

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.990 
layers for five and a half seconds and
as<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> said<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.530> amp<00:02:40.739> damage<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> huge<00:02:41.580> so

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
as I said that amp damage is huge so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.030 
as I said that amp damage is huge so
