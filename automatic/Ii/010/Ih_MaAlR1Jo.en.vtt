00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.139
 good ramón sometimes rolling 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 mathematics still tell us that the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 betis is in first but if they say that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.369
 the next days could be already 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.330
 once and for all 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.790
 I guess happy 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.760
 it's true that we are better than 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.180
 last week and one week less 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.420
 but 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.240
 12 points remain and we only get 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.550
 6 therefore it is not enough there is 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.110
 follow we have to go to Santander to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 win because if in Santander we lose 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 we can go back to 3 so there's 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.580
 than to win as we always do and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 that we are good but I think that the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.750
 team deserves all the recognition and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 all the pride of beticismo because today 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.120
 It was a difficult day with very hot we 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 matured the game well and I think that at 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.610
 physically finished the team has been 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.530
 very well and with the party matured then 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.970
 We have had the peace of mind of having the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.970
 scoreboard in favor 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.469
 maybe the first few minutes have seen us 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.539
 a good betty but the punch has arrived 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.360
 and in the end the good match has 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.310
 left over until the final stretch well let's go 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 that as I tell you about these parties we have 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 already had three or four here with me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 the party had to mature what is there 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.100
 work it is very difficult to earn a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 soccer match at 10 minutes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.870
 I remember the osasuna match that was 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.510
 similar 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.980
 party we knew that in addition to the heat 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.410
 what he did and how he plays 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.240
 the lugo were going to make us run behind 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.280
 of the ball but I think the team has 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 run well has done well and in the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 the second part we have already removed the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.550
 ball us and I sincerely believe that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.710
 I do not know if the marker reflects what happened 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.830
 but the betis has won because it has been 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.830
 best 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.119
 good the pp you've searched with the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.770
 changes a recognition to 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.429
 front at best thinking of three 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.429
 matches in a week 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.819
 it is not time for recognition for anyone 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.179
 it's time to think that on Thursday we have 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.420
 another and the party was solved and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.340
 give him more minutes in the field besides 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 people like rené the one that works very well 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.040
 with his mouth shut working hard 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.440
 going to the front always deserves its 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.720
 minutes and deserves to participate and deserves the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.129
 goal that he has had and that the coach 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.160
 recognize the work you do during the 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.829
 week anyway it's awful not what 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.590
 of rubén and molina a Sunday yes and the 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.420
 another also the next at least 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.959
 since I'm here if I do not know what 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.959
 I would go before 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.190
 these good afternoon I wanted to know what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 has happened to piccini it seemed that he had 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.260
 play options and pants and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.060
 psychoanalysts piccini yesterday had a 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 small problem again in the injury 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.620
 old and although it does not seem alarming nor 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.810
 nothing we have preferred having three 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.239
 matches in the week we preferred 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.060
 we thought that the most coherent that 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.720
 miller play this one that has rest 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.730
 from mallorca to today are seven days 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.310
 not 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.340
 Thursday that is more space is more 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.019
 short and good to see if we get that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.599
 Christian goes for Thursday and if not 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.709
 Well, we will have to look for another alternative 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.959
 because we also have the problem that 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.360
 miller has four cards for the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.720
 Sunday has fallen in day and good now 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.200
 we have this antonio adam is ceballos 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.349
 is Cadiz is miller with four 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.360
 cards and good in this tanda of three 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.540
 matches in seven days that's important 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.540
 as well
