registration system the SSR simple are
the<00:00:25.970> simple<00:00:26.330> registration<00:00:26.599> system<00:00:27.490> it's<00:00:28.490> very

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
the simple registration system it's very

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.570 
the simple registration system it's very
easy<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.180> use<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.779> it's<00:00:30.189> adaptable<00:00:31.189> pretty

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
easy to use and it's adaptable pretty

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.830 
easy to use and it's adaptable pretty
much<00:00:31.730> any<00:00:31.910> kind<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.180> frame<00:00:32.330> if<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.570> want<00:00:32.780> to

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
much any kind of frame if you want to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.290 
much any kind of frame if you want to
use<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.769> can<00:00:33.949> put<00:00:34.160> this<00:00:34.280> type<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.699> pin<00:00:34.910> system

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
use you can put this type of pin system

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.910 
use you can put this type of pin system
on<00:00:35.480> wooden<00:00:35.870> frames<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.350> can<00:00:36.410> put<00:00:36.620> them<00:00:36.739> on<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
on wooden frames you can put them on the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160 
on wooden frames you can put them on the
neumann<00:00:37.190> roller<00:00:37.460> frames<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.750> also<00:00:38.900> put

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
neumann roller frames you can also put

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.320 
neumann roller frames you can also put
them<00:00:39.230> onto<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.650> aluminum<00:00:39.860> frame<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:41.210> I'd

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
them onto the aluminum frame so what I'd

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.790 
them onto the aluminum frame so what I'd
like<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.660> do<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:41.989> give<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.410> little<00:00:42.440> brief

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
like to do is give you a little brief

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.900 
like to do is give you a little brief
idea<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.850> how<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.089> system<00:00:44.420> works<00:00:44.840> so

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
idea of how the system works so

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.709 
idea of how the system works so
basically<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.120> we're<00:00:47.270> going<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.420> do<00:00:47.570> is

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
basically what we're going to do is

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.420 
basically what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:47.870> going<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.020> pre<00:00:48.320> align<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.040> artwork

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
we're going to pre align the artwork

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.540 
we're going to pre align the artwork
onto<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.969> screen<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.989> pre-press<00:00:51.410> area<00:00:51.860> so

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
onto the screen in the pre-press area so

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.740 
onto the screen in the pre-press area so
that<00:00:52.700> everything<00:00:53.090> is<00:00:53.239> already<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.690> a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
that everything is already in a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.290 
that everything is already in a
registration<00:00:54.350> system<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:55.879> when<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:56.149> dig

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
registration system so that when we dig

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.639 
registration system so that when we dig
it<00:00:56.390> out<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.719> press<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.170> already<00:00:57.410> pre

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
it out to the press it's already pre

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.279 
it out to the press it's already pre
lined<00:00:57.920> up<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.430> how<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.000> do<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.449> is<00:00:59.629> first<00:01:00.050> of

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
lined up and how we do that is first of

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.619 
lined up and how we do that is first of
all<00:01:00.410> we<00:01:00.530> have<00:01:00.680> these<00:01:00.800> pin<00:01:01.100> bars<00:01:01.370> now<00:01:02.180> these<00:01:02.300> pin

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
all we have these pin bars now these pin

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.180 
all we have these pin bars now these pin
bars<00:01:02.840> actually<00:01:03.110> mount<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.829> bottom<00:01:04.100> of

bars actually mount to the bottom of
your<00:01:04.250> screen<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:04.699> whether<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.210> use<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
your screen so whether you use the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.420 
your screen so whether you use the
wooden<00:01:05.690> screen<00:01:06.170> or<00:01:06.380> aluminum<00:01:06.830> screen<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:07.340> new

yourself it's very easy to do now what's
nice<00:01:29.810> about<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.259> system<00:01:30.649> here<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.429> that<00:01:31.640> if

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
nice about the system here is that if

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.270 
nice about the system here is that if
you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:32.060> zoom<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:32.720> little<00:01:32.840> bit

you can zoom in a little bit
on<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.670> bottom<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> pin<00:01:34.270> bars<00:01:34.479> you'll<00:01:34.690> see

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
on the bottom of the pin bars you'll see

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.350 
on the bottom of the pin bars you'll see
a<00:01:34.900> hole<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.740> slot<00:01:36.100> on<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.880> bottom<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.299> the

well<00:01:38.799> this<00:01:38.950> slot<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.940> this<00:01:40.030> hole<00:01:40.270> will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
well this slot and this hole will

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.440 
well this slot and this hole will
actually<00:01:41.110> attach<00:01:41.890> itself<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.670> fix<00:01:42.880> itself<00:01:43.180> to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
actually attach itself and fix itself to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.420 
actually attach itself and fix itself to
the<00:01:43.570> pins<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:44.259> are<00:01:44.680> located<00:01:45.070> on<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
the pins that are located on the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.330 
the pins that are located on the
registration<00:01:45.850> system<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.590> basically<00:01:48.040> when<00:01:48.310> I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
registration system so basically when I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.820 
registration system so basically when I
take<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.790> screen<00:01:49.119> here<00:01:49.479> stand<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.530> front<00:01:50.649> of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
take this screen here stand in front of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.600

that we're actually going to be using a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
that we're actually going to be using a
little<00:02:17.590> bit<00:02:17.769> later<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.489> demonstration

vacuum holes that are mounted on some

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.789 
vacuum holes that are mounted on some
floor<00:02:41.320> will<00:02:41.890> literally<00:02:42.130> suck<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.060> artwork

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
floor will literally suck the artwork

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.800 
floor will literally suck the artwork
securely<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> backing<00:02:45.670> board<00:02:45.850> I'll<00:02:46.540> do

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
securely to the backing board I'll do

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.080 
securely to the backing board I'll do
that<00:02:46.989> right<00:02:47.200> now<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:48.760> going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> position

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
that right now so I'm going to position

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
that right now so I'm going to position
my<00:02:49.420> registration<00:02:50.350> marks<00:02:50.739> exactly<00:02:51.549> in<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
line up on this grid pattern here I want

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.449 
line up on this grid pattern here I want
to<00:02:57.430> press<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> backing<00:02:58.720> pedal<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.459> it

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
to press on the backing pedal now it

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.100 
to press on the backing pedal now it
takes<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.790> second<00:03:01.120> or<00:03:01.180> two<00:03:01.239> for<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.599> vacuum<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
takes a second or two for the vacuum to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.350 
takes a second or two for the vacuum to
engage<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.190> now<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.849> operators

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
engage but now you can see the operators

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.420 
engage but now you can see the operators
hell<00:03:04.569> they're<00:03:04.810> literally<00:03:05.590> with<00:03:05.830> no<00:03:05.860> cables

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
being sucked under my vacuum now I can

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.360 
being sucked under my vacuum now I can
take<00:03:10.180> my<00:03:10.239> silk<00:03:10.690> string<00:03:10.930> frame<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.160> they<00:03:12.250> have

like pin bars mounted on to it and all I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830 
like pin bars mounted on to it and all I
need<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.190> do<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:16.000> stand<00:03:16.299> in<00:03:16.420> front<00:03:16.599> of<00:03:16.720> the

the artwork is attached exactly where I
want<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.760> be<00:03:45.989> using<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.079> registration

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
want it to be using the registration

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.940 
want it to be using the registration
system<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.970> see<00:03:49.180> up<00:03:49.329> here<00:03:49.739> at<00:03:50.739> this

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
system like you see up here at this

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.280 
system like you see up here at this
point<00:03:51.250> all<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.430> need<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.849> do<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.599> put<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:52.989> inside

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
point all I need to do is put it inside

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.289 
point all I need to do is put it inside
my<00:03:53.470> exposure<00:03:53.890> unit<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.519> expose<00:03:54.879> it<00:03:55.120> and

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
my exposure unit and expose it and

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.940 
my exposure unit and expose it and
that's<00:03:55.720> another<00:03:55.989> nice<00:03:56.230> feature<00:03:56.470> about<00:03:56.680> the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
that's another nice feature about the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.289 
that's another nice feature about the
system<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.459> don't<00:03:57.579> need<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:57.849> second

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
system you don't need a second

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.819 
system you don't need a second
attachment<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:58.930> goes<00:03:58.989> into<00:03:59.290> your<00:03:59.380> exposure

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
attachment that goes into your exposure

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.339 
attachment that goes into your exposure
unit<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> lot<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.540> other<00:04:01.780> systems<00:04:02.230> out

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
unit like a lot of other systems out

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.199 
unit like a lot of other systems out
there<00:04:02.410> who<00:04:02.650> would<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.609> is<00:04:03.790> basically

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
there who would have this is basically

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.089 
there who would have this is basically
put<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.599> in<00:04:04.690> any<00:04:04.870> exposure<00:04:05.290> system<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.980> you

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
put it in any exposure system that you

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.580 
put it in any exposure system that you
have<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.609> expose<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.480> screen<00:04:07.810> once<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
have and expose the screen once the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.589 
have and expose the screen once the
screen<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:08.889> exposed<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.700> wash<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.120> out<00:04:10.269> and

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
screen is exposed you wash it out and

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.440 
screen is exposed you wash it out and
you<00:04:11.139> just<00:04:11.319> read<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.709> second<00:04:12.130> we<00:04:13.030> repeat<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
you just read the second we repeat the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.479 
you just read the second we repeat the
loop<00:04:13.569> depths<00:04:13.930> again<00:04:14.260> for<00:04:14.859> each<00:04:15.069> color<00:04:15.400> that

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
loop depths again for each color that

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.099 
loop depths again for each color that
you<00:04:15.790> might<00:04:15.970> have<00:04:16.180> if<00:04:16.419> there<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> second

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
you might have if there is a second

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.110 
you might have if there is a second
color<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.889> line<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.609> second<00:04:18.970> code

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
color you line it up to the second code

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.000 
color you line it up to the second code
now<00:04:19.299> one<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.019> things<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.470> like<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.829> do

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
now one of the things that I like to do

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.100 
now one of the things that I like to do
is<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.760> like<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:21.970> use<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.240> little<00:04:22.450> bit<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.810> dry

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
is I like to use a little bit of a dry

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.339 
is I like to use a little bit of a dry
erase<00:04:23.410> marker<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.460> circle<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.599> location<00:04:26.229> of

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
erase marker and circle the location of

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.680 
erase marker and circle the location of
where<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.590> had<00:04:26.740> put<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.160> on<00:04:27.310> previously<00:04:28.090> so

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
where I had put that on previously so

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.990 
where I had put that on previously so
when<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:28.870> do<00:04:28.990> use<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.560> second<00:04:30.010> cover<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.550> can

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
when I do use the second cover I can

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.519 
when I do use the second cover I can
position

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:31.529 
position

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.919 
position
second<00:04:31.949> color<00:04:32.159> exactly<00:04:32.729> where<00:04:33.569> that<00:04:33.689> first

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:33.929 
second color exactly where that first

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.069 
second color exactly where that first
color<00:04:34.259> was<00:04:35.149> now<00:04:36.149> with<00:04:36.329> all<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.569> registration

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:37.079 
color was now with all the registration

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:39.139 
color was now with all the registration
systems<00:04:37.709> worth<00:04:37.979> there<00:04:38.519> are<00:04:38.579> only<00:04:38.669> as<00:04:38.849> good<00:04:38.879> as

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:39.149 
systems worth there are only as good as

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.419 
systems worth there are only as good as
the<00:04:39.269> operator<00:04:39.749> so<00:04:40.379> if<00:04:40.439> you<00:04:40.529> wear<00:04:40.679> glasses<00:04:40.709> put

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:41.429 
the operator so if you wear glasses put

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.279 
the operator so if you wear glasses put
your<00:04:41.579> glasses<00:04:41.789> on<00:04:42.089> if<00:04:42.689> you<00:04:42.839> have<00:04:42.989> a<00:04:43.019> little

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
your glasses on if you have a little

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.779 
your glasses on if you have a little
headset<00:04:43.709> that<00:04:43.739> will<00:04:44.039> allow<00:04:44.279> you<00:04:44.339> to<00:04:44.609> focus

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
headset that will allow you to focus

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.209 
headset that will allow you to focus
better<00:04:45.239> on<00:04:45.809> the<00:04:46.019> location<00:04:46.589> do<00:04:46.769> use<00:04:47.009> them

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
better on the location do use them

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:48.799 
better on the location do use them
because<00:04:47.339> the<00:04:47.579> more<00:04:47.759> accurate<00:04:48.209> you<00:04:48.359> are<00:04:48.389> in

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:48.809 
because the more accurate you are in

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.929 
because the more accurate you are in
here<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.679> more<00:04:49.859> accurate<00:04:50.399> we<00:04:50.519> will<00:04:50.669> be<00:04:50.789> out

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
here the more accurate we will be out

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.179 
here the more accurate we will be out
there
