00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.499 
he came out he always just stood there
and<00:02:07.200> occasionally<00:02:07.770> he<00:02:07.890> moved<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:09.270> side

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and occasionally he moved from one side

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
and occasionally he moved from one side
to<00:02:09.539> feel<00:02:09.840> burn<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.379> had<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.099> hissy<00:02:11.459> fit

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to feel burn just had a little hissy fit

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.300 
to feel burn just had a little hissy fit
and<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.970> move

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and just move

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860 
and just move
round<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.580> over<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> place<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.540> he<00:02:13.630> never

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
round all over the place but he never

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
round all over the place but he never
came<00:02:14.080> towards<00:02:14.709> us<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> something<00:02:16.330> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
came towards us so that is something to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.760 
came towards us so that is something to
know<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.489> start<00:02:19.420> shooting<00:02:20.020> after<00:02:20.200> he's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
know if you start shooting after he's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.240 
know if you start shooting after he's
already<00:02:21.010> out<00:02:21.310> he<00:02:22.239> will<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.930> come<00:02:23.230> towards<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
already out he will not come towards you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.220 
already out he will not come towards you
and<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.700> he<00:02:24.790> does<00:02:25.030> that's<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.810> random

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
and if he does that's just a random

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.490 
and if he does that's just a random
chance<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.800> happening<00:02:27.660> remember<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
chance of it happening remember that you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
chance of it happening remember that you
need<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.920> shoot<00:02:30.190> before<00:02:30.700> he<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:32.260> out<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.489> what

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
need to shoot before he is out so what

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.210 
need to shoot before he is out so what
did<00:02:34.269> we<00:02:34.300> learn<00:02:34.420> from<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.780> if<00:02:35.200> you're<00:02:35.920> doing

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
did we learn from this if you're doing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.100 
did we learn from this if you're doing
the<00:02:36.340> strategy<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:37.180> includes<00:02:37.330> bringing<00:02:37.870> him

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the strategy that includes bringing him

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
the strategy that includes bringing him
closer<00:02:38.319> than<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.040> need<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.610> shoot<00:02:39.760> him<00:02:40.000> before

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
closer than you need to shoot him before

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.500 
closer than you need to shoot him before
he<00:02:40.750> comes<00:02:40.989> out<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.550> showed<00:02:42.790> here<00:02:43.030> he's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
he comes out but as I showed here he's

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.750 
he comes out but as I showed here he's
inconsistent<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.650> he<00:02:45.160> doesn't<00:02:45.489> like

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
inconsistent with it he doesn't like

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.520 
inconsistent with it he doesn't like
always<00:02:46.269> come<00:02:46.510> towards<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.959> straight<00:02:47.380> away

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
always come towards you straight away

always come towards you straight away
and<00:02:48.040> obviously<00:02:48.910> sometimes<00:02:49.330> he<00:02:49.720> doesn't<00:02:49.900> come

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
and obviously sometimes he doesn't come

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.509 
and obviously sometimes he doesn't come
towards<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.470> at<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.980> shoot<00:02:51.250> at<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
towards you at all if you shoot at the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.320 
towards you at all if you shoot at the
wrong<00:02:51.700> time<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:53.019> because<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.950> or<00:02:54.330> greatly

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
wrong time so because of this or greatly

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.820 
wrong time so because of this or greatly
