00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.130
 the charges 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 soon more send our truck and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 from here we can adjust our 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 Mirrors 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 the number one is the mirror of the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.590
 left is to say this as it shows us 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.170
 here we can do it with the mouse 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.620
 if we want to move to the left 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.270
 cleared or with the same letters that we 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.270
 they say there to make it easier for us 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 you can see you adjust 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.520
 How do you think your mirror is convenient? 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.490
 I'll leave it there because also 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.380
 It serves to see the cars that come here 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 very close to one 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 at traffic lights or junctions you do not want 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 do 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.370
 the number 5 is for the little one 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 left is to say this 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.010
 we can also move it to our 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.010
 whim 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.490
 whatever 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.780
 and so they can move around the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.940
 different mirrors 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.380
 this is the front this 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.810
 they can also move it 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.310
 this is more like to know how 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.390
 far away from the car that goes forward in 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.370
 the traffic lights 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.370
 or when there is a trunk I did not know 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.229
 then comes the side that is this 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.229
 big me usually I almost do not use it 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.650
 let's take a little to have more 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.650
 view of the cars 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 on the right that is this 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 let's work it a little 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 and finally the little one 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.819
 everything depends on how you are 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.159
 configuring 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.950
 your truck how they feel more comfortable to 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:44.780
 moment to drive the memory what 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.310
 can do by means of clicks on the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.939
 mouse 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 or with the same keys that come out here to 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.370
 w s 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.100
 what are the same keys with which 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.190
 they may be driving so that they 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.400
 make it easier 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 I hope you served them see you 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.930
 in a next
