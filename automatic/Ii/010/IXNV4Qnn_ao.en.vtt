lightest colors of things but i thought

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770 
lightest colors of things but i thought
this<00:01:33.810> color<00:01:34.380> looked<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.310> light<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.090> i

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
this color looked very light and i

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
this color looked very light and i
believe<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.189> little<00:01:38.430> bit

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.010 
believe there is one a little bit
lighter<00:01:38.790> than<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.900> might

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
lighter than this one I think it might

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.770 
lighter than this one I think it might
be<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.320> ivory<00:01:40.619> till<00:01:41.220> I've<00:01:41.970> read<00:01:42.360> affair<00:01:42.750> or

something and then this one is fair to
light<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.460> stick<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.030> um

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
light so I need to really stick with um

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.130 
light so I need to really stick with um
the<00:01:49.490> lightest<00:01:50.490> lightest<00:01:50.939> colors<00:01:51.240> because

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the lightest lightest colors because

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
the lightest lightest colors because
when<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> put<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.820> horrible<00:01:54.509> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
when I put it on it's not horrible but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
when I put it on it's not horrible but
i'll<00:01:55.290> show<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> doesn't<00:01:56.399> really

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
i'll show you that it doesn't really

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.310 
i'll show you that it doesn't really
match<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
match and you can kind of see there it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
match and you can kind of see there it
looks<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.590> little<00:01:58.710> yellowy<00:01:59.189> golden<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.909> me

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
looks a little yellowy golden on me

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.899 
looks a little yellowy golden on me
because<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.380> color<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.430> too<00:02:02.640> dark

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
because this color is really too dark

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.240 
because this color is really too dark
for<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> tube<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.799> looks<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> little

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
for me and in the tube it looks a little

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
for me and in the tube it looks a little
bit<00:02:05.460> lighter<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.969> even<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.570> finger<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
bit lighter and even on my finger it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.430 
bit lighter and even on my finger it
looks<00:02:07.320> lighter<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.099> um<00:02:08.959> yeah<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.319> you're

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
looks lighter so um yeah so if you're

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.290 
looks lighter so um yeah so if you're
pretty<00:02:10.679> fair<00:02:11.009> i<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.340> go<00:02:11.459> with<00:02:11.489> something

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pretty fair i would go with something

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.720 
pretty fair i would go with something
even<00:02:12.810> lighter<00:02:13.020> than

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
even lighter than

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.970 
even lighter than
and<00:02:14.209> again<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.629> one<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.930> feared<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.379> light<00:02:15.560> so

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and again this one is feared to light so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.399 
and again this one is feared to light so
this<00:02:16.489> was<00:02:16.700> really<00:02:16.940> dark<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.510> me<00:02:17.540> not<00:02:18.260> even

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
this was really dark for me not even

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.020 
this was really dark for me not even
just<00:02:18.680> start<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.310> turns<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.730> yellow

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
just start but it turns that yellow

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.780 
just start but it turns that yellow
color<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:21.019> if<00:02:21.379> I<00:02:21.530> went<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.950> one<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.670> was

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
color so if I went to one that was

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.580 
color so if I went to one that was
lighter<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.540> there<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.319> believe

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
lighter if there is one and I believe

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.229 
lighter if there is one and I believe
there<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.220> would<00:02:25.549> have<00:02:25.640> really<00:02:26.120> enjoyed

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
there is I would have really enjoyed

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.990 
there is I would have really enjoyed
this<00:02:26.569> product<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.549> like<00:02:28.760> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
this product but because it's like this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.640 
this product but because it's like this
I<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.239> really<00:02:29.480> use<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.780> much<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.819> even<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:33.290> I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
I don't really use it much and even if I

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.530 
I don't really use it much and even if I
get<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.040> bit<00:02:34.250> more<00:02:34.370> tan<00:02:34.730> than<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.330> might

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
get a little bit more tan than it might

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.339 
get a little bit more tan than it might
be<00:02:35.720> nice<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.980> might<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.400> nice<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.019> did

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
be nice and it might be nice that I did

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.780 
be nice and it might be nice that I did
get<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> little<00:02:39.890> bit<00:02:40.129> darker<00:02:40.310> because<00:02:40.640> I

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
get one a little bit darker because I

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.149 
get one a little bit darker because I
will<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.209> getting<00:02:41.299> more<00:02:41.599> tan<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.950> might

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
will be getting more tan so it might

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.160 
will be getting more tan so it might
work<00:02:43.310> out<00:02:43.489> after<00:02:43.549> all<00:02:43.909> but<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.659> now<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.810> can't

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
work out after all but for now I can't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.839 
work out after all but for now I can't
really<00:02:45.290> use<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:45.950> they<00:02:46.010> don't<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.280> any<00:02:46.489> Sun

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
really use it so they don't have any Sun

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.600 
really use it so they don't have any Sun
on<00:02:47.030> me<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:48.170> get<00:02:48.440> too<00:02:48.650> tan<00:02:48.829> anyway<00:02:49.430> in

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
on me and I don't get too tan anyway in

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.589 
on me and I don't get too tan anyway in
the<00:02:49.700> summer<00:02:49.940> because<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.239> use<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> lot<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
the summer because I use a lot of

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.930 
the summer because I use a lot of
sunscreen<00:02:50.989> protection<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.760> know<00:02:52.849> if

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
sunscreen protection so I don't know if

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.900 
sunscreen protection so I don't know if
this<00:02:53.060> will<00:02:53.480> work<00:02:53.810> out<00:02:54.440> too<00:02:54.620> well<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.280> as<00:02:55.579> far

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
this will work out too well but as far

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.970 
this will work out too well but as far
as<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.209> texture<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.260> everything<00:02:57.739> it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
as the texture of it and everything it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.460 
as the texture of it and everything it
is<00:02:58.160> very<00:02:58.609> very<00:02:58.730> nice<00:02:59.299> i'm<00:02:59.989> going<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.260> show<00:03:00.440> you

like<00:03:00.799> right<00:03:01.010> through<00:03:01.220> here<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.579> just<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:02.510> very

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
like right through here it just is very

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.680 
like right through here it just is very
very<00:03:03.379> smooth<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.370> spreads<00:03:04.790> out<00:03:04.940> pretty<00:03:05.329> nicely

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
very smooth it spreads out pretty nicely

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.530 
very smooth it spreads out pretty nicely
and<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.620> definitely<00:03:06.859> gives<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.700> tint<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.209> color

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
and it definitely gives a tint of color

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.140 
and it definitely gives a tint of color

on a moisturizer and SPF with that it's

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.479 
on a moisturizer and SPF with that it's

this one for a tinted moisturizer but

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.190 
this one for a tinted moisturizer but
again<00:03:37.549> this<00:03:37.760> color<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.120> really<00:03:38.569> really<00:03:38.900> dark

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
again this color is really really dark

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.720 
again this color is really really dark
for<00:03:39.500> me<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.769> don't<00:03:40.010> know<00:03:40.069> if<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:40.310> picking

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
for me and I don't know if it's picking

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.449 
for me and I don't know if it's picking
up<00:03:40.849> but<00:03:41.090> even<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:41.989> my<00:03:42.169> hands<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.859> looks<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:43.340> a

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
up but even on my hands it looks like a

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.870 
up but even on my hands it looks like a
bronzer<00:03:44.120> right<00:03:44.359> now<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:44.989> i<00:03:45.019> would<00:03:45.560> definitely

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
bronzer right now so i would definitely

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.280 
bronzer right now so i would definitely
have<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.090> try<00:03:47.239> one<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.780> was<00:03:47.900> lighter<00:03:48.139> than

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
have to try one that was lighter than

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.949 
have to try one that was lighter than
this<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:48.889> see<00:03:49.250> how<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.609> went<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
this one and see how it went but the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.870 
this one and see how it went but the
only<00:03:51.200> thing<00:03:51.290> i<00:03:51.530> can<00:03:51.590> say<00:03:51.919> is<00:03:52.099> these<00:03:52.310> might<00:03:52.669> have

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
only thing i can say is these might have

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.839 
only thing i can say is these might have
a<00:03:52.910> little<00:03:53.150> these<00:03:54.079> might<00:03:54.349> not<00:03:54.859> just<00:03:55.160> be<00:03:55.280> neutral

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
a little these might not just be neutral

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.000 
a little these might not just be neutral
colors<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.450> might<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:56.989> tone<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.590> looks<00:03:57.859> to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
colors it might the tone of it looks to

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.309 
colors it might the tone of it looks to
be<00:03:58.129> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.400> bit<00:03:58.579> more<00:03:58.700> golden<00:03:59.209> tone<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.290> i

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
be a little bit more golden tone so i

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.869 
be a little bit more golden tone so i
would<00:04:00.650> definitely<00:04:00.680> be<00:04:01.340> careful<00:04:01.730> with<00:04:01.849> that

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
would definitely be careful with that

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.729 
would definitely be careful with that
but<00:04:02.599> if<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.780> are<00:04:02.900> planning<00:04:03.139> to<00:04:03.349> get<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.590> little

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
but if you are planning to get a little

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.229 
but if you are planning to get a little
bit<00:04:03.980> more<00:04:04.129> sun<00:04:04.459> than<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.760> might<00:04:04.879> be<00:04:05.000> perfect

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
bit more sun than it might be perfect

darker than me know that it might be
