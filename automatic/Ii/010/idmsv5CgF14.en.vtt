it moves down the line that's actually
one<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> reasons<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.200> long<00:01:25.470> boards<00:01:25.979> with

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
one of the reasons that long boards with

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
one of the reasons that long boards with
an<00:01:26.340> emphasis<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.880> those<00:01:27.090> riding<00:01:27.450> use<00:01:27.869> such<00:01:28.140> big

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
an emphasis on those riding use such big

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.830 
an emphasis on those riding use such big
single<00:01:28.920> fins<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> slows<00:01:30.210> down<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
single fins because it slows down the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
up as a quad now look at the outline on

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.730 
up as a quad now look at the outline on
this<00:03:32.570> board<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:32.990> we<00:03:33.080> can<00:03:33.260> see<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.590> it's

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
this board and we can see that it's

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.190 
this board and we can see that it's
probably<00:03:34.070> suited<00:03:34.730> best<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.420> trimming<00:03:35.810> and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
probably suited best for trimming and

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.050 
probably suited best for trimming and

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
how wide the board becomes from about

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.000 
how wide the board becomes from about

a lot of your time with your feet about

a lot of your time with your feet about
right<00:03:55.700> here<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:56.600> would<00:03:56.690> probably<00:03:57.290> like

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
right here and you would probably like

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.380 
right here and you would probably like
this<00:03:57.470> kind<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.980> shape<00:03:58.190> most<00:03:58.460> set<00:03:58.970> up<00:03:59.150> as<00:03:59.360> a

this kind of a shape most set up as a

this kind of a shape most set up as a
single<00:03:59.750> fin<00:04:00.110> however<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.830> look<00:04:00.920> at<00:04:01.100> this

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
single fin however if you look at this

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.980 
single fin however if you look at this
board<00:04:01.520> side<00:04:01.850> by<00:04:02.060> side<00:04:02.330> with<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> one<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:02.960> I

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
board side by side with the one that I

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.960 
board side by side with the one that I
had<00:04:03.290> made<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.860> see<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:04.400> my<00:04:04.430> tail

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
had made you can see that on my tail

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.300 
had made you can see that on my tail
it's<00:04:05.300> maybe<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.780> half<00:04:06.350> an<00:04:06.530> inch<00:04:06.710> to<00:04:06.770> an<00:04:07.040> inch

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it's maybe like half an inch to an inch

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.760 
it's maybe like half an inch to an inch
wider<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.300> what<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.660> does<00:04:08.870> on<00:04:09.020> my<00:04:09.230> shape<00:04:09.560> is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
wider and what that does on my shape is

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.860 
wider and what that does on my shape is
it<00:04:09.950> adds<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.460> little<00:04:10.670> bit<00:04:10.790> more<00:04:10.910> surface<00:04:11.720> area

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
it adds a little bit more surface area

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.470 
it adds a little bit more surface area
back<00:04:12.590> here<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> tail<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.240> when<00:04:14.360> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
back here in the tail so that when the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.450 
back here in the tail so that when the
waves<00:04:14.660> are<00:04:14.870> really<00:04:14.900> small<00:04:15.440> say<00:04:15.890> knee-high<00:04:16.400> or

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
waves are really small say knee-high or

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.810 
waves are really small say knee-high or
so<00:04:16.880> maybe<00:04:17.270> mid<00:04:17.630> thigh<00:04:18.020> you<00:04:18.410> can

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
so maybe mid thigh you can

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.370 
so maybe mid thigh you can
that<00:04:19.060> board<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.630> get<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> little<00:04:20.080> bit<00:04:20.200> more

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
that board and get a little bit more

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.380 
that board and get a little bit more
resistance<00:04:20.740> and<00:04:21.190> support<00:04:21.460> under<00:04:22.060> your<00:04:22.090> back

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
resistance and support under your back

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.690 
resistance and support under your back
foot<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.780> try<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.140> get<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> board<00:04:23.740> pumping<00:04:24.580> and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
foot to try to get the board pumping and

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.370 
foot to try to get the board pumping and
flowing<00:04:25.090> down<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.420> line<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.990> little<00:04:26.230> bit

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
flowing down the line just a little bit

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.080 
flowing down the line just a little bit
and<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:26.710> think<00:04:26.770> that<00:04:27.100> board<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.520> suited<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:27.970> a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
and I think that board is suited just a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.460 
and I think that board is suited just a
little<00:04:28.330> bit<00:04:28.480> more<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.870> being<00:04:28.990> set<00:04:29.230> up<00:04:29.260> as<00:04:29.440> a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
little bit more to being set up as a

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.230 
little bit more to being set up as a
quad<00:04:29.830> while<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> tail<00:04:30.550> coming<00:04:30.880> back<00:04:31.030> this

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
quad while the tail coming back this

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.970 
quad while the tail coming back this
narrow<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.020> little<00:04:32.290> bit<00:04:32.410> more<00:04:32.560> suited<00:04:32.950> to

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
narrow is a little bit more suited to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.710 
narrow is a little bit more suited to
being<00:04:33.220> set<00:04:33.460> up<00:04:33.550> as<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.910> single<00:04:34.180> fit<00:04:34.510> either

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.890 
tail can work either as a quad or a
single<00:04:39.310> fin<00:04:39.520> it's<00:04:39.820> just<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.270> little<00:04:40.630> bit<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.840> a

single fin it's just a little bit of a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.420 
single fin it's just a little bit of a
modification<00:04:41.110> that<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.770> can<00:04:41.980> make<00:04:42.130> when<00:04:42.340> you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
modification that you can make when you

a little bit wider to really optimize it
