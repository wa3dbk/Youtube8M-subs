take the place of an inch and a half
roadmaster<00:00:28.410> bars<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:29.039> every<00:00:29.189> eighth<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.519> an

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
roadmaster bars for every eighth of an

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
roadmaster bars for every eighth of an
inch<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.970> gained<00:00:30.150> about<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.420> 30%<00:00:30.810> roll

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
inch we gained about a 30% roll

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.350 
inch we gained about a 30% roll
reduction<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> quarter<00:00:33.329> inch

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
reduction so this is a quarter inch

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.729 
reduction so this is a quarter inch
bigger<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> should<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> great

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
