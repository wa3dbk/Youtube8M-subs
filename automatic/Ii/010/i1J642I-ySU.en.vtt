so<00:01:03.480> building<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> mercurial<00:01:04.860> scimitar<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:06.180> for

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so building a mercurial scimitar in for

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
so building a mercurial scimitar in for
410<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.260> doesn't<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:07.740> decrease<00:01:08.189> your

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
410 it doesn't really decrease your

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
410 it doesn't really decrease your
damage<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.390> gets<00:01:09.540> atid<00:01:09.990> now

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
building up to your infinity edge how

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
building up to your infinity edge how
many<00:02:07.979> times<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> look<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> items<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.149> the

range<00:02:22.409> in<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> game<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.280> ridiculous<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
range in the game is ridiculous so you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.059 
range in the game is ridiculous so you
can<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.840> scale<00:02:25.140> illusion<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.590> goes<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
can out scale illusion that goes the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.369 
can out scale illusion that goes the
same<00:02:26.099> build<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> was<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.900> no<00:02:28.019> problem

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
same build so I was like it's no problem

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.050 
same build so I was like it's no problem
i'll<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:28.799> MIT<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.159> keep<00:02:29.370> farming<00:02:29.670> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
i'll just go MIT and keep farming and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.729 
i'll just go MIT and keep farming and
eventually<00:02:30.450> we'll<00:02:30.599> reach<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.959> point<00:02:31.170> well

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
eventually we'll reach that point well

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.100 
eventually we'll reach that point well
that<00:02:32.040> leads<00:02:32.250> us<00:02:32.489> very<00:02:32.849> nicely<00:02:32.970> onto<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.720> replay

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that leads us very nicely onto a replay

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.449 
that leads us very nicely onto a replay
that<00:02:34.260> i'd<00:02:34.349> like<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.680> actually<00:02:34.830> pull<00:02:35.069> up<00:02:35.190> onto

terrifying on kate is it really just ie
and<00:03:16.620> shiv<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.340> that's<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:18.090> yeah

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
and shiv and that's it you're in yeah

and shiv and that's it you're in yeah
after<00:03:18.930> two<00:03:19.079> items<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.500> start<00:03:19.739> scaling<00:03:19.980> over

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
after two items you start scaling over

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.589 
after two items you start scaling over
it's<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.700> hard<00:03:20.910> especially<00:03:21.060> because

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
it's really hard especially because

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
every BF item is a DAT now so you can

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.640 
every BF item is a DAT now so you can
hit<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:23.910> ridiculous<00:03:24.599> 80<00:03:24.810> damage<00:03:25.049> point<00:03:25.440> like

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

with as you guys were up against the
LeBlanc<00:03:34.530> one<00:03:34.769> more<00:03:34.919> time<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> people<00:03:36.000> said

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
LeBlanc one more time and people said

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.120 
LeBlanc one more time and people said
well<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> silence<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.260> removed<00:03:37.980> it

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
well that out the silence is removed it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.349 
well that out the silence is removed it
might<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.609> good<00:03:38.760> versus<00:03:39.030> twist<00:03:39.239> of

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
might not be so good versus twist of

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.930 
might not be so good versus twist of
fate<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.660> fraggin<00:03:40.019> seemed<00:03:40.459> very<00:03:41.459> confident

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
fate but fraggin seemed very confident

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.819 
fate but fraggin seemed very confident
obviously<00:03:42.389> but<00:03:42.510> still<00:03:42.780> curb<00:03:43.200> coming<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.769> very

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
obviously but still curb coming up very

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.610 
obviously but still curb coming up very
strong<00:03:44.190> um<00:03:45.060> yes<00:03:45.599> a<00:03:45.780> curb<00:03:45.959> did<00:03:46.230> pretty<00:03:46.470> well

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
strong um yes a curb did pretty well

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.520 
strong um yes a curb did pretty well
like<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.880> LeBlanc<00:03:48.359> still<00:03:48.630> gets<00:03:48.959> rolling

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
like if if LeBlanc still gets rolling

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.039 
like if if LeBlanc still gets rolling
like<00:03:49.980> she<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.370> still<00:03:50.549> kill<00:03:50.819> TF<00:03:51.299> because<00:03:51.720> she

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
like she can still kill TF because she

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.120 
like she can still kill TF because she
still<00:03:52.200> has<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.380> same<00:03:52.530> damage<00:03:52.799> she<00:03:52.980> just

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
still has the same damage she just

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.550 
still has the same damage she just
doesn't<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.459> silence<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.569> if<00:03:54.959> TF<00:03:55.319> is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
doesn't have the silence so if TF is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.740 
doesn't have the silence so if TF is
slightly<00:03:55.950> ahead<00:03:56.190> or<00:03:56.579> even<00:03:57.000> he<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.419> counter

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
slightly ahead or even he can counter

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.059 
slightly ahead or even he can counter
play<00:03:57.930> by<00:03:58.049> picking<00:03:58.230> cards<00:03:58.530> while<00:03:58.769> she's<00:03:58.950> trying

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
play by picking cards while she's trying

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.250 
play by picking cards while she's trying
