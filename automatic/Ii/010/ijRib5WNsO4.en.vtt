I wonder if you could just get the two
layers<00:02:10.020> apart<00:02:10.440> easily<00:02:10.679> let<00:02:11.640> me<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.910> try<00:02:12.230> one

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
layers apart easily let me just try one

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.850 
layers apart easily let me just try one
more<00:02:13.470> thing

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
more thing

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940 
more thing
and<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.540> dissect<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.680> little

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and see if we can dissect this a little

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.880 
and see if we can dissect this a little
differently<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.410> Oreo<00:02:19.709> where

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
differently we can like an Oreo where

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.960 
differently we can like an Oreo where
you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.130> split<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> open<00:02:22.760> now<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> lot<00:02:23.940> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
you can split it open now a lot of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.090 
you can split it open now a lot of
people<00:02:24.150> might<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.590> scrape<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.770> peanut

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
