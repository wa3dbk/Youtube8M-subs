00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's big bristly and it's just really

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's big bristly and it's just really
honestly<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> problem<00:02:02.939> with

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
honestly I don't have a problem with

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840 
honestly I don't have a problem with
these<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> brush<00:02:03.689> heads<00:02:03.960> like

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660 

I<00:02:07.080> don't<00:02:08.080> know<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.470> works<00:02:08.679> for<00:02:08.979> me<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.399> I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
I don't know it just works for me and I

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.120 
I don't know it just works for me and I
think<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.119> way<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.300> brush<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:11.080> made<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.800> just

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
think the way the brush is made it just

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.940 
think the way the brush is made it just
coats<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.970> lashes<00:02:13.450> really<00:02:13.690> well<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.710> that's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
coats the lashes really well so that's

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.170 
coats the lashes really well so that's
what<00:02:15.280> creates<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.940> volume<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.400> did<00:02:18.760> define

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
what creates the volume it did define

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.260 
what creates the volume it did define
separate<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.520> define<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.730> separate<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
separate a define and separate the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.610 
separate a define and separate the
lashes<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.890> amazingly<00:02:23.890> enough<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:25.480> did<00:02:26.020> not

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
lashes and amazingly enough it did not

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.850 
lashes and amazingly enough it did not
clump<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> really<00:02:29.260> appreciate<00:02:29.830> about

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
clump and what I really appreciate about

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.490 
clump and what I really appreciate about
it<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.240> extremely<00:02:32.610> extremely

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it is that it is extremely extremely

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.740 
it is that it is extremely extremely
buildable<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.790> was<00:02:37.060> playing<00:02:37.420> with<00:02:37.690> it
