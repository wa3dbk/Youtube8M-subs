the<00:00:11.849> speedo<00:00:12.780> actually<00:00:13.500> drops<00:00:13.740> down<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.130> zero

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the speedo actually drops down to zero

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
the speedo actually drops down to zero
when<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> phone<00:00:15.570> rings<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> little

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
when the phone rings which is a little

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.279 
when the phone rings which is a little
bit<00:00:16.560> strange<00:00:16.800> other<00:00:17.250> than<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> we've<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
bit strange other than that we've got a

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
bit strange other than that we've got a
tip<00:00:19.289> that's<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.859> sort<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> dangling<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.720> guess

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
tip that's just sort of dangling I guess

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
tip that's just sort of dangling I guess
it<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.990> fixed<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.529> bracket<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:23.010> some

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it was fixed to that bracket at some

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.740 
it was fixed to that bracket at some
point<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> we're<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.080> take<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
point so we're gonna take it out and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.029 
point so we're gonna take it out and
let's<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:27.930> what's<00:00:28.170> happening<00:00:28.740> behind<00:00:28.830> the

actually there are some cable ties on

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.340 
actually there are some cable ties on
the<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> maybe<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.350> wasn't<00:00:49.559> too<00:00:50.100> bad

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the on this and maybe it wasn't too bad

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.020 
the on this and maybe it wasn't too bad
in<00:00:52.350> general<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.129> mean<00:00:53.160> oh<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.699> should<00:00:53.910> have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in general I mean oh that should have

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
in general I mean oh that should have
been<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.719> should<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.020> been<00:00:55.140> mounted<00:00:55.320> from

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
been that should have been mounted from

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.959 
been that should have been mounted from
the<00:00:55.890> power<00:00:56.070> supply<00:00:56.280> should<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> been

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the power supply should have been

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
the power supply should have been
correct<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.719> least<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.960> measure<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
correct but at least I measure put the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.679 
correct but at least I measure put the
mic<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.100> place<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.619> yeah<00:01:04.619> but

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
mic in the right place and yeah but

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
mic in the right place and yeah but
obviously<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.900> also<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
obviously it also was a bit of a bit of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
obviously it also was a bit of a bit of
a<00:01:09.030> prat<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.229> experienced<00:01:10.710> installer<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a prat or an experienced installer just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.539 
a prat or an experienced installer just
a<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> connect<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.840> mute<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:14.130> random

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
a just to connect a mute to one random

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
a just to connect a mute to one random
wire<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.939> says<00:01:15.150> meet<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.110> because

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
wire that says meet two on there because

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
wire that says meet two on there because
obviously<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.340> incorrect<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> they've

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
obviously that's incorrect and they've

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420 
obviously that's incorrect and they've
connected<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> speedo<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.250> go

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
connected to where the speedo will go

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.929 
connected to where the speedo will go
for<00:01:20.790> speed<00:01:21.600> relevant<00:01:22.290> volume<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> radio

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
for speed relevant volume for the radio

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.260 
for speed relevant volume for the radio
you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> rock<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.020> radio<00:01:25.320> goes

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
you know how the rock the radio goes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.340 
you know how the rock the radio goes
louder<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.900> faster<00:01:28.320> than

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
louder when you're going faster than

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
louder when you're going faster than
quietens<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> once<00:01:30.600> you've<00:01:30.750> been

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
quietens down so that once you've been

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.649 
quietens down so that once you've been
blocked<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.759> fact<00:01:32.939> test<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> mute

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
blocked and if I in fact test the mute

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
blocked and if I in fact test the mute
which<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.500> Installer<00:01:34.920> should<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
which is what the Installer should have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.510 
which is what the Installer should have
done<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.250> clearly<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
done I can see that that clearly is the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.999 
done I can see that that clearly is the
mute<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.290> money's<00:01:40.500> connected<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
mute and the money's connected to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160 
mute and the money's connected to
clearly<00:01:41.460> isn't<00:01:41.610> ascetically<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> speedo

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
clearly isn't ascetically to the speedo

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
clearly isn't ascetically to the speedo
so<00:01:43.320> yeah<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> market<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:45.350> if<00:01:46.350> you
