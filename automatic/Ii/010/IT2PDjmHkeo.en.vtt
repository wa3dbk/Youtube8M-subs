p51 audio playback was loud and clear

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
p51 audio playback was loud and clear
and<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.420> overall<00:01:12.720> gaming<00:01:13.170> capability<00:01:13.770> was

would not move on it crashed several

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.910 
would not move on it crashed several
times<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:48.870> decided<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.350> check<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.650> real

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
times so we decided to check out real

times so we decided to check out real
racing<00:02:50.220> 3<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.090> same<00:02:51.300> exact<00:02:51.720> thing

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
racing 3 and the same exact thing

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.200

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
happened with real racing 3 as well so a

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.760 
happened with real racing 3 as well so a
lot<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> games<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:54.990> not<00:02:55.110> compatible<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.740> the
