00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
feel so it feels like you're actually

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.560 
feel so it feels like you're actually
typing<00:01:10.080> something<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> solar

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
typing something and there's a solar

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.260
