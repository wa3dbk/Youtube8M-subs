00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
text-to-speech function is really good

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.370 
text-to-speech function is really good
and<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:23.040> fact<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.840> pronunciation<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.959> better

than I can do

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.760 
than I can do
the<00:02:27.180> downside<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:28.020> reads<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.470> letter

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the downside is it reads the letter

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.550 
the downside is it reads the letter
seven<00:02:29.310> after<00:02:29.970> each<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.320> know<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
seven after each of the you know in a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
seven after each of the you know in a
read<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.130> letter<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.610> each<00:02:32.730> verse<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.270> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
read the letter of each verse as it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
read the letter of each verse as it's
reading<00:02:33.780> through<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.380> does<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> very

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
reading through so it does a very

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.120 
reading through so it does a very
literal<00:02:35.190> reading<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> still<00:02:37.650> helpful<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
literal reading it is still helpful to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.100 
literal reading it is still helpful to
have<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.640> still<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.360> handy<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:39.959> able

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
have it's still really handy to be able

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.250 
have it's still really handy to be able
to<00:02:40.230> read<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.160> able<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.959> have<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.080> read

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
to read and then be able to have it read

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.670 
to read and then be able to have it read
to<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.040> hands<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.370> busy<00:02:45.680> obviously

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to you if your hands are busy obviously

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
to you if your hands are busy obviously
I'll<00:02:47.220> say<00:02:47.670> some<00:02:47.850> things<00:02:48.090> about<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.720> my

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I'll say some things about that in my

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
I'll say some things about that in my
review<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.470> anyway<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> wanted<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.520> able<00:02:50.580> to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.550 
review but anyway I wanted to be able to
physically<00:02:51.120> show<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.080> like<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
physically show you what it's like to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
physically show you what it's like to
see<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.800> turn<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> pages<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.239> pause<00:02:54.450> that's

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
see it turn the pages the pause that's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.440 
see it turn the pages the pause that's
there<00:02:55.050> between<00:02:55.260> each<00:02:55.590> turn<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.330> what<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
there between each turn and what the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
there between each turn and what the
text-to-speech<00:02:57.750> function<00:02:58.440> actually<00:02:58.590> looks

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
text-to-speech function actually looks

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.880 
text-to-speech function actually looks
like<00:02:59.190> when<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.580> going<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.540> that's<00:03:01.380> why<00:03:01.530> all<00:03:01.709> I

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
like when it's going so that's why all I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.440 
like when it's going so that's why all I
have<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> video<00:03:02.640> portion<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.209> but

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
have for the video portion of this but

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.950 
have for the video portion of this but
I'll<00:03:03.630> write<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.260> rest<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:04.770> now
