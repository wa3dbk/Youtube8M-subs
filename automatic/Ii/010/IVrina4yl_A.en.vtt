 Things you should think about

 you should be easy between 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 cooker fridge and sink 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.430
 can move 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.350
 These three areas are called that 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.910
 working triangle 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 The shape of the kitchen usually becomes 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 this is determined by the floor plan of the room 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.350
 But does not mean that a new kitchen 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.320
 must have the same shape again here 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.029
 few suggestions on the kitchen floor plan 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.710
 a simple kitchenette is suitable 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 for small kitchens not for larger ones 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 here you can have a kitchen island 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.020
 set up 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 this creates more space for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.150
 storage and can also serve as a dining area 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.340
 Meeting place and room divider serve one 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.690
 eleven forms creates a good one 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 working pressure and offers plenty of room for 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.970
 Keeping a U shape offers a lot 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 room for storage and a large one 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.460
 work space but the space must be big 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.220
 his 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 with parallel kÃ¼chenzeilen you have two 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.180
 opposite work areas that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.220
 does not need much space and is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 suitable if the kitchen door at the front 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.680
 there is space next to the hob 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 important to turn off hot pots when 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.310
 you have very little space on the eighth 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 adequate space between sink 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.750
 and hob eighth at parallel 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 kitchens insist that two persons 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.770
 can work at the same time 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.990
 you need a distance of 120 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.579
 centimeters and doors on both sides 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.100
 to open at the same time 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.840
 Make sure that the cabinets are not the ones 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 obstruct the view of the worktop 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 pay attention to the manufacturer information what the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.130
 height of an extractor hood affects one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 stove at eye level avoids frequent 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 stooping and children can not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.310
 close to the work surface next to the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.119
 oven is handy for hot sheets 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.759
 turn off 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.859
 save utensils pots and pans in 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.079
 close the stove so that they are light 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.399
 are reachable 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.500
 glasses cutlery and dishes nearby 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.320
 the dishwasher make it easier for you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.759
 in and out 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.619
 between closet and wall should be 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.990
 there is room for a bar so that you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.610
 the door can open completely that is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 especially important in extractable 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.950
 wire baskets in the cabinet following things 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.319
 You should avoid baking oven 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.180
 or dishwasher not in a corner 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.099
 they block the extracts and cabinets 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.450
 next to it a sink on the wall 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.450
 interrupts your work flow 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.440
 a oven heats directly on the wall 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.569
 the wall on drawers in a corner 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.040
 block the adjacent closet and 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.810
 could its doors and handles 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.340
 to damage 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.830
 it seems like you have to do a lot 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.750
 Consider the online kitchen planner helps 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.760

 A consultant will be planning with you 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 not just going through a kitchen with it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.799
 looks great but also great 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.799
