for<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.369> third<00:00:26.369> expansion<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.930> get<00:00:28.019> a

bit<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.469> seem<00:00:46.620> getting<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.070> far<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
bit I don't seem getting very far with

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.110 
bit I don't seem getting very far with
basically<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.840> units<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.710> limo<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
basically the units that limo has out I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
basically the units that limo has out I
mean<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.570> has<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.050> seamount<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> rates<00:00:52.949> indeed

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mean he has a seamount of rates indeed

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.470 
mean he has a seamount of rates indeed
the<00:00:53.370> amount<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.730> tanks<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> looks<00:00:54.390> like

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the amount of tanks it looks like

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.350 
the amount of tanks it looks like
basically<00:00:55.469> enough<00:00:55.770> forces<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.340> repel<00:00:56.399> some

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
basically enough forces to repel some

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
basically enough forces to repel some
kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.629> incoming<00:00:58.050> attack<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.739> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
kind of incoming attack it looks like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
kind of incoming attack it looks like
he's<00:00:59.010> happy<00:00:59.309> enough<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.510> allow<00:01:01.020> himself

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
he's happy enough to to allow himself

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
he's happy enough to to allow himself
push<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> his<00:01:02.520> base<00:01:02.699> maybe<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
push out of his base maybe go for a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
push out of his base maybe go for a
third<00:01:03.989> expansion<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.710> minute<00:01:04.949> he's<00:01:05.339> bringing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
third expansion a minute he's bringing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.190 
third expansion a minute he's bringing
up<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.909> forces<00:01:06.360> almost<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.750> he's<00:01:06.900> trying

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
up more forces almost like he's trying

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.340 
up more forces almost like he's trying
to<00:01:07.409> basically<00:01:07.710> draw<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.119> lines<00:01:09.360> scanned<00:01:10.049> he

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to basically draw the lines scanned he

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
to basically draw the lines scanned he
sees<00:01:10.619> basically<00:01:11.400> what's<00:01:11.610> happening<00:01:11.670> he<00:01:12.060> sees

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
sees basically what's happening he sees

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
sees basically what's happening he sees
that<00:01:12.570> third<00:01:12.900> expansion<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.770> realizes<00:01:14.100> he's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that third expansion up he realizes he's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
that third expansion up he realizes he's
behind<00:01:14.700> economically<00:01:15.270> he's<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.080> races<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
behind economically he's got races of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
behind economically he's got races of
his<00:01:16.619> own<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> definitely<00:01:17.700> actually

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
his own this is definitely actually

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
his own this is definitely actually
going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.560> into<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.670> match<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
going to turn out into a good match a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to turn out into a good match a
very<00:01:21.990> interesting<00:01:22.500> match<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.070> factors<00:01:23.490> going

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
very interesting match for factors going

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630 
very interesting match for factors going
down<00:01:23.939> rates<00:01:24.270> being<00:01:24.540> produced<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
down rates being produced I like that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
down rates being produced I like that
both<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.240> players<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.810> decided<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
both these players have decided to do a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.090 
both these players have decided to do a
wraith<00:01:29.790> tank<00:01:30.150> Goliath<00:01:31.110> battle<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
wraith tank Goliath battle out of any of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
wraith tank Goliath battle out of any of
the<00:01:32.280> dual<00:01:32.549> Terran<00:01:32.880> matches<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.960> that's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the dual Terran matches I think that's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
the dual Terran matches I think that's
the<00:01:34.530> most<00:01:34.829> interesting<00:01:35.100> situation<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.060> can

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the most interesting situation we can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.950 
the most interesting situation we can
end<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.750> hope<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.150> lomo<00:01:39.750> who

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
end up or hope for I think it's lomo who

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.590 
end up or hope for I think it's lomo who
has<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.500> SUV<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> far<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.090> position<00:01:42.509> I

has a SUV in the far right position I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450 
has a SUV in the far right position I
think<00:01:42.840> he's<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:44.009> he<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.189> anything

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

think he's I don't think he has anything
that<00:01:44.729> he<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> defend<00:01:45.750> that

damage to the gas production as possible
right<00:01:55.979> now<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.490> gas<00:01:56.670> production<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.479> just

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
right now the gas production is just

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
right now the gas production is just
absolutely<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
absolutely this is going to be the

lifeline the bread and life of these
players<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.020> more<00:02:04.200> gas<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.310> can

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
players the more gas that they can

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
players the more gas that they can
produce<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.270> better<00:02:06.509> they're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
produce the better they're going to have

out<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> field<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.080> many

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
out of the field with is just so many

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
out of the field with is just so many
gas<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.649> units<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.580> raised<00:02:11.849> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
gas have units out you have raised you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.540 
gas have units out you have raised you
have<00:02:12.209> tanks<00:02:12.569> Goliath<00:02:13.560> aren't<00:02:13.950> as<00:02:14.010> gas<00:02:14.280> heavy

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
have tanks Goliath aren't as gas heavy

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.190 
have tanks Goliath aren't as gas heavy
but<00:02:14.879> my<00:02:15.209> guess<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.420> you're<00:02:15.660> not<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.020> see

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but my guess is you're not going to see

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.839 
but my guess is you're not going to see
as<00:02:16.410> many<00:02:16.709> Goliath<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.580> you're<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
as many Goliath out as you're going to

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.130 
as many Goliath out as you're going to
see<00:02:17.910> race<00:02:18.209> looks<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.720> they're<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.050> be

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
see race looks like they're going to be

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.740 
see race looks like they're going to be
primary<00:02:19.560> at<00:02:19.709> air<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.550> he's<00:02:20.730> prepping<00:02:21.480> that

primary at air here he's prepping that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.080 
primary at air here he's prepping that
third<00:02:21.900> expansion<00:02:22.170> which<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:23.910> he

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
third expansion which I don't think he

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.199 
third expansion which I don't think he
has<00:02:24.270> enough<00:02:24.300> forces<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.170> defend<00:02:25.790> lomo<00:02:26.790> also

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
has enough forces to defend lomo also

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.449 
has enough forces to defend lomo also

lomo<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.340> not<00:02:50.519> quite<00:02:50.730> sure<00:02:50.760> what<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.540> that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
lomo I'm not quite sure what the that

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.380 
lomo I'm not quite sure what the that
was<00:02:52.080> probably<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.920> worst<00:02:53.390> micromanagement

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
was probably the worst micromanagement

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.030 
was probably the worst micromanagement
of<00:02:54.540> units<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:54.959> seen<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.260> while<00:02:55.379> losing<00:02:55.709> two

of units have seen in a while losing two

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.020 
of units have seen in a while losing two
to<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.220> single<00:02:57.060> unit<00:02:58.580> basically<00:02:59.580> trying<00:02:59.819> to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
to the single unit basically trying to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.270 
to the single unit basically trying to
do<00:03:00.330> kind<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.750> standard<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> delicious<00:03:01.890> spin

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
do kind of a standard you delicious spin

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970 
do kind of a standard you delicious spin
on<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.550> instead<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:04.260> pulling<00:03:04.620> them<00:03:04.739> out<00:03:04.830> of

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
on it instead not pulling them out of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920 
on it instead not pulling them out of
range<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.940> delayed<00:03:06.180> target<00:03:06.540> fire<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.870> I

range for the delayed target fire and I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.390 
range for the delayed target fire and I
think<00:03:07.080> I've<00:03:07.140> losing<00:03:07.379> both<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:08.069> now<00:03:08.099> here's

up harassing he's gonna lose that rake

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.969 
up harassing he's gonna lose that rake
to<00:04:37.729> that<00:04:37.880> turret<00:04:38.210> though<00:04:38.530> I'm<00:04:39.530> not<00:04:39.590> sure<00:04:39.860> if

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
to that turret though I'm not sure if

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.980 
to that turret though I'm not sure if
that<00:04:40.099> was<00:04:40.220> necessarily<00:04:40.820> worth<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.300> but

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
that was necessarily worth it but

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.540 
that was necessarily worth it but
definitely<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.590> looks<00:04:42.740> like<00:04:42.860> Yuri's<00:04:43.190> got<00:04:43.430> an

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
definitely it looks like Yuri's got an

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.980 
definitely it looks like Yuri's got an
expansion<00:04:44.060> that's<00:04:44.240> about<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.599> go<00:04:44.720> up<00:04:44.840> in<00:04:44.870> the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
expansion that's about to go up in the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.350 
expansion that's about to go up in the
upper<00:04:45.169> right<00:04:45.349> in<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.530> meantime<00:04:45.710> he's<00:04:46.099> got<00:04:46.310> a

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
upper right in the meantime he's got a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.330 
upper right in the meantime he's got a
small<00:04:47.360> drop<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:48.320> he's<00:04:48.470> pulling<00:04:48.860> back<00:04:49.039> right

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
small drop that he's pulling back right

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.140 
small drop that he's pulling back right
now<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:51.470> yeah<00:04:51.620> still<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.639> economic

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
now but yeah still the economic

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.089 
now but yeah still the economic
advantage<00:04:53.539> still<00:04:54.139> in<00:04:54.320> almost<00:04:54.590> favor<00:04:54.979> the

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
advantage still in almost favor the

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.860 
advantage still in almost favor the
production<00:04:55.520> vantage<00:04:55.909> I<00:04:56.150> would<00:04:56.539> say<00:04:56.690> though

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
production vantage I would say though

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.710 
production vantage I would say though
has<00:04:57.110> at<00:04:57.409> this<00:04:57.590> point<00:04:57.860> swung<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.280> eerie<00:04:58.720> eerie

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.850 
has at this point swung to eerie eerie
looks<00:05:00.139> like<00:05:00.320> he's<00:05:00.470> building<00:05:00.650> another

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
looks like he's building another

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.070 
looks like he's building another
expansion<00:05:01.400> off<00:05:01.789> looks<00:05:02.210> like<00:05:02.449> he's<00:05:02.690> got<00:05:02.810> two

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
expansion off looks like he's got two

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.960 
expansion off looks like he's got two
expansions<00:05:03.620> going<00:05:03.919> up<00:05:04.039> in<00:05:04.159> fact<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.610> he's<00:05:04.820> got

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
expansions going up in fact and he's got

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.850 
expansions going up in fact and he's got
another<00:05:05.210> one<00:05:05.360> spotted<00:05:05.690> in<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.440> right<00:05:06.650> he's

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
another one spotted in the right he's

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.960 
another one spotted in the right he's
gonna<00:05:07.039> know<00:05:07.310> when<00:05:08.409> when<00:05:09.409> that<00:05:10.250> expansion<00:05:10.669> is

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
gonna know when when that expansion is

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.760 
gonna know when when that expansion is
going<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.240> be<00:05:11.330> scouted<00:05:11.750> out<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.169> mean<00:05:12.560> if<00:05:12.650> it

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
going to be scouted out and I mean if it

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.170 
going to be scouted out and I mean if it
doesn't<00:05:13.099> he<00:05:13.190> can<00:05:13.310> set<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.550> down<00:05:13.639> himself<00:05:13.820> the

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180
