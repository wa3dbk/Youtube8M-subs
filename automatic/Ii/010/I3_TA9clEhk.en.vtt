this<00:03:41.200> process<00:03:41.770> could<00:03:42.400> be<00:03:42.430> different

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
this process could be different

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.780 
this process could be different
depending<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.880> what<00:03:45.880> kind<00:03:46.210> of<00:03:47.400> computer<00:03:48.400> you

depending on what kind of computer you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.510 
depending on what kind of computer you
have<00:03:53.070> but<00:03:55.020> it's<00:03:56.020> generally<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.800> same<00:03:57.130> across

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520

you<00:03:58.240> know<00:03:58.470> find<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.590> cover<00:03:59.860> that's<00:04:00.130> hiding

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
you know find the cover that's hiding

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.680 
you know find the cover that's hiding
your<00:04:00.730> memory<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.950> then<00:04:06.300> it's<00:04:07.300> pretty<00:04:07.570> much

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
your memory and then it's pretty much

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.510 
your memory and then it's pretty much
just<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:08.260> simple<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:11.040> take<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.070> screwed<00:04:12.370> up

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
just as simple as a take a screwed up

out stick the new in this took me a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.070 
out stick the new in this took me a
little<00:04:20.109> bit<00:04:20.230> longer<00:04:20.470> because<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:21.180> was<00:04:22.180> stuck<00:04:22.930> on

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
little bit longer because I was stuck on

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.630 
little bit longer because I was stuck on
my<00:04:23.200> angle<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.680> didn't<00:04:24.070> have<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.310> right<00:04:24.490> angle

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
my angle I didn't have the right angle

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.590 
my angle I didn't have the right angle
turn<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.270> into<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:29.250> okay<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.760> tighten

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
turn to go into it so okay it's tighten

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
not have to be cooled down I reckon all

now<00:04:44.860> we're<00:04:45.520> gonna<00:04:45.610> flip<00:04:45.879> it<00:04:45.909> over<00:04:46.150> get<00:04:46.870> back<00:04:47.169> in

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
now we're gonna flip it over get back in

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.760 
now we're gonna flip it over get back in
there<00:04:47.499> and<00:04:47.529> wire<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.949> back<00:04:48.009> up<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.520> my<00:04:48.610> TV<00:04:49.770> and

there and wire it back up to my TV and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:01.019 
there and wire it back up to my TV and
check<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.699> make<00:04:52.120> sure<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.779> works<00:04:59.849> all<00:05:00.849> right

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:01.029 
check and make sure it works all right

weird sort of view I've got to work with

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:30.650 
weird sort of view I've got to work with
here<00:05:10.089> but<00:05:11.370> first<00:05:12.370> fire

okay there we go now I'm just gonna
close<00:05:33.900> this<00:05:33.960> down<00:05:35.600> so<00:05:36.600> we<00:05:36.870> can<00:05:37.020> see<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.440> entire

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
close this down so we can see the entire

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:54.129 
close this down so we can see the entire
42<00:05:48.289> yes<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.530> go<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:52.130> knocked<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.250> camera<00:05:53.520> over

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
42 yes you go it knocked the camera over

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:08.480 
42 yes you go it knocked the camera over
and<00:05:55.220> we<00:05:56.220> are<00:05:56.280> loaded<00:06:06.949> total<00:06:07.949> memory

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
and we are loaded total memory

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.300 
and we are loaded total memory
all<00:06:08.729> right<00:06:08.910> here<00:06:09.620> seventy<00:06:10.620> six<00:06:10.860> hundred<00:06:11.160> and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
all right here seventy six hundred and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.969 
all right here seventy six hundred and
fifty<00:06:11.580> nine<00:06:11.610> megabytes<00:06:12.000> which<00:06:12.860> for<00:06:13.860> this

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
fifty nine megabytes which for this

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.730 
fifty nine megabytes which for this
system<00:06:14.370> counts<00:06:14.759> as<00:06:14.849> eight<00:06:15.060> gigs<00:06:15.440> because<00:06:16.440> it

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
system counts as eight gigs because it

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.439 
system counts as eight gigs because it
has<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.190> shared<00:06:17.669> video<00:06:17.970> memory<00:06:18.539> and<00:06:18.960> all<00:06:19.500> that

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
has the shared video memory and all that

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.980 
has the shared video memory and all that
you<00:06:21.449> can<00:06:21.630> see<00:06:21.810> this<00:06:22.050> graph<00:06:22.320> is<00:06:22.590> now<00:06:22.770> much<00:06:23.039> lower

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
you can see this graph is now much lower

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.810 
you can see this graph is now much lower
let's<00:06:24.990> fire<00:06:25.320> up<00:06:25.349> flow<00:06:25.970> to<00:06:26.970> be<00:06:27.150> easy<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.820> when

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
let's fire up flow to be easy and when

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.520 
let's fire up flow to be easy and when
it<00:06:29.970> focuses<00:06:30.509> you<00:06:30.750> will<00:06:30.930> see<00:06:32.930> 8,192<00:06:33.930> megabytes

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
it focuses you will see 8,192 megabytes

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.689 
it focuses you will see 8,192 megabytes
installed<00:06:35.159> memory<00:06:35.599> and<00:06:37.190> here<00:06:38.190> are<00:06:38.430> the

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
installed memory and here are the

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.399 
installed memory and here are the
timings<00:06:39.479> I'll<00:06:40.020> move<00:06:40.740> this<00:06:41.130> up<00:06:41.460> so<00:06:42.229> maybe<00:06:43.229> you

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
timings I'll move this up so maybe you

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.560 
timings I'll move this up so maybe you
can<00:06:43.620> see<00:06:43.830> there<00:06:44.099> the<00:06:44.340> timings<00:06:44.789> for<00:06:45.030> it<00:06:45.180> anyway

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
can see there the timings for it anyway

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.850 
can see there the timings for it anyway
so<00:06:45.780> that's<00:06:46.349> my<00:06:47.010> RAM<00:06:47.280> install<00:06:47.760> on<00:06:48.539> my<00:06:49.409> samsung

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
so that's my RAM install on my samsung

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.460 
so that's my RAM install on my samsung
