this<00:04:21.660> I'm<00:04:21.959> dropping<00:04:22.409> on<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.770> since<00:04:23.070> since<00:04:23.460> we

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
this I'm dropping on see since since we

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.060 
this I'm dropping on see since since we
spawned<00:04:23.909> up<00:04:24.030> here<00:04:24.240> or<00:04:25.169> not<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.710> didn't<00:04:25.919> spawn

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
spawned up here or not we didn't spawn

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.900 
spawned up here or not we didn't spawn
up<00:04:26.220> here<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.490> they<00:04:26.610> spawn<00:04:27.300> down<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.630> see

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
up here but they spawn down and see

up here but they spawn down and see
Nick<00:04:28.270> at<00:04:28.420> sea<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.230> figured<00:04:29.590> she<00:04:29.740> would<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:29.950> a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
Nick at sea so I figured she would be a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.190 
Nick at sea so I figured she would be a
good<00:04:30.100> spot<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.640> at<00:04:31.390> least<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.600> get<00:04:31.750> one<00:04:31.870> killing

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
good spot and at least I get one killing

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.380 
good spot and at least I get one killing
the<00:04:32.350> air<00:04:33.010> strike<00:04:33.580> right<00:04:33.820> here<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.090> then<00:04:34.210> look

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
the air strike right here but then look

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.080

actually<00:04:48.460> I've<00:04:48.850> used<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.180> chopper<00:04:49.450> gunner<00:04:49.630> in

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
actually I've used the chopper gunner in

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.280 
actually I've used the chopper gunner in
all<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:51.010> nine<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.490> videos<00:04:51.760> from<00:04:51.970> from<00:04:52.690> ps3

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
all the nine of the videos from from ps3

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.200 
all the nine of the videos from from ps3
you<00:04:53.560> guys<00:04:53.680> have<00:04:53.830> seen<00:04:53.950> so<00:04:54.160> far<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.550> usually<00:04:54.940> only

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
you guys have seen so far I usually only

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.480 
you guys have seen so far I usually only
using<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.600> c-130<00:04:56.050> now<00:04:56.230> but<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.530> time<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.280> time<00:04:57.400> you

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
using a c-130 now but a time to time you

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.040 
using a c-130 now but a time to time you
just<00:04:57.640> gotta<00:04:57.760> do<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.300> think<00:04:58.510> for<00:04:59.020> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
just gotta do it and I think for the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.860 
just gotta do it and I think for the
most<00:04:59.230> part<00:04:59.350> the<00:05:00.040> ac-130<00:05:00.550> works<00:05:00.850> great<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:01.420> if

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
most part the ac-130 works great but if

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.230 
most part the ac-130 works great but if
you<00:05:02.020> have<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.170> three-bar<00:05:02.530> connection<00:05:03.000> or<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.090> I

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
you have a three-bar connection or if I

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.490 
you have a three-bar connection or if I
have<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.420> three-bar<00:05:04.750> connection<00:05:05.170> at<00:05:05.260> least<00:05:05.410> I'm

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
have a three-bar connection at least I'm

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.440 
have a three-bar connection at least I'm
not<00:05:05.530> able<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:06.010> get<00:05:06.130> enough<00:05:06.910> kills<00:05:07.150> with<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
not able to get enough kills with the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.360 
not able to get enough kills with the
ac-130<00:05:07.900> when<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.500> shoot<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.740> burst<00:05:08.950> fire<00:05:09.160> down

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
ac-130 when I shoot the burst fire down

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.620 
ac-130 when I shoot the burst fire down
where<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.670> enemies<00:05:09.940> are<00:05:09.970> spawning<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.480> just

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
where the enemies are spawning it just

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.360 
where the enemies are spawning it just
doesn't<00:05:10.930> kill<00:05:11.080> him<00:05:11.200> it's<00:05:11.290> like<00:05:11.500> just<00:05:12.100> enough

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
doesn't kill him it's like just enough

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.860 
doesn't kill him it's like just enough
lag<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.760> make<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.150> I<00:05:13.210> can't<00:05:13.480> actually<00:05:13.630> get

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
lag to make it so I can't actually get

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.200 
lag to make it so I can't actually get
the<00:05:13.930> multi<00:05:14.500> kill<00:05:14.740> at<00:05:15.730> least<00:05:15.790> that's<00:05:16.030> what<00:05:16.150> it

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
the multi kill at least that's what it

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.300 
the multi kill at least that's what it
feels<00:05:16.390> so<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.530> was<00:05:17.650> sick<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:17.980> doing<00:05:18.190> that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
feels so and I was sick of doing that

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.550 
feels so and I was sick of doing that
and<00:05:18.580> not<00:05:18.940> getting<00:05:19.240> host<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.900> decided<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.410> go

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
and not getting host so I decided to go

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.830 
and not getting host so I decided to go
ahead<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.100> throw<00:05:21.340> down<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.610> chopper<00:05:21.940> also<00:05:22.810> I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
ahead and throw down the chopper also I

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.930 
ahead and throw down the chopper also I
was<00:05:23.050> using<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.320> chopper<00:05:23.680> since<00:05:23.890> I<00:05:24.130> think<00:05:24.880> I

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
was using the chopper since I think I

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.970 
was using the chopper since I think I
have<00:05:25.060> better<00:05:25.240> luck<00:05:25.420> doing<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.780> chopper<00:05:26.140> when<00:05:26.950> I

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
have better luck doing a chopper when I

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.170 
have better luck doing a chopper when I
when<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.370> play<00:05:27.550> 6v6<00:05:27.910> TDM<00:05:28.870> or<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:30.340> domination

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
when I play 6v6 TDM or the domination

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.150 
when I play 6v6 TDM or the domination
game<00:05:31.510> types<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.470> now<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:32.620> was<00:05:32.800> trying<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.070> do

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
that man I was really getting desperate

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.490 
that man I was really getting desperate
to<00:05:34.420> get<00:05:34.480> these<00:05:34.630> last<00:05:34.810> couple<00:05:34.960> nukes<00:05:35.290> so<00:05:35.440> i'm

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
to get these last couple nukes so i'm

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.290 
to get these last couple nukes so i'm
glad<00:05:35.650> i<00:05:35.740> was<00:05:35.950> able<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:36.160> get<00:05:36.250> this<00:05:36.400> one<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:36.730> a

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
glad i was able to get this one on a

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.540 
glad i was able to get this one on a
state<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.750> last<00:05:37.960> one<00:05:38.290> is<00:05:38.800> on<00:05:39.070> i<00:05:39.100> think<00:05:39.340> it's
