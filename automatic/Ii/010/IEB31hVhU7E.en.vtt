in<00:00:06.790> this<00:00:06.939> tutorial<00:00:07.180> will<00:00:07.750> show<00:00:07.779> you<00:00:07.960> how<00:00:08.109> to

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
in this tutorial will show you how to

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.230 
in this tutorial will show you how to
create<00:00:08.650> a<00:00:08.679> road<00:00:09.010> suitable<00:00:09.339> to<00:00:09.730> drive<00:00:09.969> along

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
create a road suitable to drive along

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.419 
create a road suitable to drive along
the<00:00:11.049> first<00:00:11.290> thing<00:00:11.469> we<00:00:11.589> need<00:00:11.709> to<00:00:11.769> do<00:00:11.980> is<00:00:12.190> create

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
the first thing we need to do is create

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.459 
the first thing we need to do is create
a<00:00:12.549> reference<00:00:12.820> object<00:00:13.240> so<00:00:13.870> we<00:00:13.990> know<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.289> road

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
a reference object so we know the road

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.090 
a reference object so we know the road
is<00:00:14.679> of<00:00:14.829> the<00:00:14.950> correct<00:00:15.280> width<00:00:16.770> turn<00:00:17.770> on<00:00:17.950> the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
is of the correct width turn on the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.250 
is of the correct width turn on the
follow<00:00:18.370> terrain<00:00:18.910> tool<00:00:19.210> then<00:00:19.750> go<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.080> the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
follow terrain tool then go to the

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.490 
follow terrain tool then go to the
roll-up<00:00:20.680> bar<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.400> entity<00:00:21.910> then<00:00:22.840> find<00:00:23.200> a<00:00:23.320> nice

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
roll-up bar to entity then find a nice

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.920 
roll-up bar to entity then find a nice
car<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:23.980> place<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.430> on<00:00:24.520> your<00:00:24.550> terrain<00:00:24.930> we're

road now let's make it short on the road
like<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.800> should<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.420> road<00:02:17.600> tool<00:02:17.840> and

like it should go to the road tool and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.560 
like it should go to the road tool and
change<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.590> width<00:02:18.770> value<00:02:19.090> 8<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.390> good
