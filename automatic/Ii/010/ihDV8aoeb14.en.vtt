00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.929 
engineering AK a large lamp I'm gonna do
it<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> engineering<00:01:20.520> let's<00:01:20.729> see<00:01:20.880> how

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it for the engineering let's see how

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.960 
it for the engineering let's see how
much<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.340> 34k<00:01:23.340> oh<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.820> not

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
now I'm gonna go my 0 and see what I can

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.270 
now I'm gonna go my 0 and see what I can
get<00:01:29.009> ok<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.060> back<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.600> 0<00:01:31.079> ker<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.950> yeah

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
good item I can get on my circuit

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.160 
good item I can get on my circuit
because<00:01:40.650> stuff<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.240> can't<00:01:42.899> wear
