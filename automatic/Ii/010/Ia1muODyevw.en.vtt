00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
all right this is a great trick to show

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.599 
all right this is a great trick to show
to<00:00:03.750> two<00:00:04.080> people<00:00:04.500> who<00:00:04.620> are<00:00:04.830> close<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.339> one

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
to two people who are close to one

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.760 
to two people who are close to one
another<00:00:05.640> or<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.720> could<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.960> done<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.470> yourself

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
another or it could be done for yourself

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.140 
another or it could be done for yourself
and<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.400> other<00:00:08.519> person

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and one other person

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
and one other person
but<00:00:09.840> basically<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.349> would<00:00:10.500> just<00:00:10.679> start<00:00:10.920> off

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
but basically you would just start off

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.580 
but basically you would just start off
with<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:11.759> person<00:00:12.200> calling<00:00:13.200> out<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
with the first person calling out the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
with the first person calling out the
word<00:00:13.740> stop<00:00:14.040> let's<00:00:14.460> say<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:14.730> stopped<00:00:15.000> up

word stop let's say they stopped up
right<00:00:15.509> there<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.859> four<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.310> spades<00:00:17.930> okay

I would place this card and just stick

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
I would place this card and just stick
it<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.070> middle<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.640> these<00:00:41.820> cards<00:00:42.180> right

six of diamonds we then give her the
marker<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> she<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.410> ahead<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.070> write

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

say her name was Jane Jane just like
that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.260 
that
and<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:13.049> take<00:01:13.229> her<00:01:13.409> card<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:15.060> place

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and I would take her card and just place

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.539 
and I would take her card and just place
it<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> middle<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.070> pile<00:01:17.340> right

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it into the middle of this pile right

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.960 
it into the middle of this pile right
here<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.799> place<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.340> cards<00:01:20.729> right

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
here and I would place these cards right

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
here and I would place these cards right
on<00:01:21.150> top<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> each<00:01:21.600> other<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.409> see

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
on top of each other so that you can see

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
on top of each other so that you can see
that<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.970> number<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.450> cards

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that there's a good number of cards

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.800 
that there's a good number of cards
separating<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:25.710> chosen<00:01:25.950> cards<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.299> then

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
separating the two chosen cards and then

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
separating the two chosen cards and then
that<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.110> slowly<00:01:28.700> push<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:31.700> now

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that would just slowly push them in now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
that would just slowly push them in now
the<00:01:32.759> idea<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.799> as<00:01:34.799> time<00:01:35.369> goes<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.500> two

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the idea here is as time goes on the two

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
the idea here is as time goes on the two
selected<00:01:38.040> cards<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> people<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
selected cards just as the people that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
selected cards just as the people that
they<00:01:40.170> represent<00:01:40.549> would<00:01:41.549> come<00:01:42.270> together<00:01:43.520> okay

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
they represent would come together okay

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.080 
they represent would come together okay
so<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:45.570> give<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> try

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.499 

now<00:01:49.689> if<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.049> look<00:01:50.170> through<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.500> cards<00:01:51.509> you'll

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
now if you look through the cards you'll

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.399 
now if you look through the cards you'll
see<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:54.360> Jane<00:01:55.360> six<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.780> diamonds<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.229> now

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
see that Jane six of diamonds is now

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.399 
see that Jane six of diamonds is now
face<00:01:56.680> up<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.689> hopefully<00:01:58.689> right<00:01:59.140> beside<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:02.220> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
face up and hopefully right beside it is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.190 
face up and hopefully right beside it is
Bob's<00:02:05.409> four<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.890> spades<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.810> let's<00:02:10.989> try<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
Bob's four of spades now let's try to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
Bob's four of spades now let's try to
take<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.650> step<00:02:11.680> further<00:02:12.330> at<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.480> point<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
take it a step further at this point I

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
take it a step further at this point I
would<00:02:14.080> ask<00:02:14.260> each<00:02:14.440> person<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.190> hold<00:02:15.489> out

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
would ask each person to just hold out

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.300 
would ask each person to just hold out
their<00:02:15.790> palm<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:18.130> would

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
their palm just like this and I would

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.080 
their palm just like this and I would
place<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.790> cards<00:02:19.330> after<00:02:19.540> squaring<00:02:20.110> them<00:02:20.230> up

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
place the cards after squaring them up

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.930 
place the cards after squaring them up
into<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:23.200> first<00:02:23.440> person's<00:02:23.860> hand<00:02:24.100> then<00:02:24.819> that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
into the first person's hand then that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.190 
into the first person's hand then that
would<00:02:25.030> ask<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.299> other<00:02:25.420> person<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.959> place

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
would ask the other person to place
