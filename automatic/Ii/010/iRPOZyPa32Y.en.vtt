hello I'm gonna show you how to do a
little<00:00:05.910> pinned<00:00:06.859> this<00:00:07.859> little<00:00:08.280> Christmas<00:00:08.670> tree

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
little pinned this little Christmas tree

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.049 
little pinned this little Christmas tree
I<00:00:09.240> mean<00:00:09.570> our<00:00:09.809> basswood<00:00:10.290> oh<00:00:10.849> it's<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
I mean our basswood oh it's about a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.079 
I mean our basswood oh it's about a
quarter<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:12.870> inch

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
quarter of an inch

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.040 
quarter of an inch
proximal<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.800> just<00:00:16.800> made<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> design<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:18.050> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
proximal I just made this design up and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.640 
proximal I just made this design up and
then<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:20.070> gonna<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> pin<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
then I'm gonna make this as a pin so you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.230 
then I'm gonna make this as a pin so you
can<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> craft<00:00:23.369> store<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
can go to a craft store and get one of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
can go to a craft store and get one of
these<00:00:25.130> nice<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.369> pins<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:29.010> glue

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
these nice little pins that you can glue

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.040 
these nice little pins that you can glue
on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> back<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:32.870> set<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.020> up

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
on the back and set that up

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.860 
on the back and set that up
and<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:36.890> can<00:00:37.040> either<00:00:37.220> use<00:00:37.490> like<00:00:37.730> gorilla<00:00:38.570> glue

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
and you can either use like gorilla glue

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.210 
and you can either use like gorilla glue
or<00:00:39.410> you<00:00:39.560> can<00:00:39.830> use

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.710 

hot<00:00:46.790> glue<00:00:47.500> on<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.560> back<00:00:49.150> set<00:00:50.150> it<00:00:50.239> up<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.570> would

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
hot glue on the back set it up I would

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.479 
hot glue on the back set it up I would
recommend<00:00:51.170> having<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.500> pin<00:00:51.710> in<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.190> down

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
recommend having the pin in a down

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.470 
recommend having the pin in a down
position<00:00:53.620> because<00:00:54.620> for<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.520> ladies<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.850> think

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
position because for the ladies I think

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.580 
position because for the ladies I think
it<00:00:56.570> makes<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.960> easier

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
it makes it easier

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.900 
it makes it easier
pin<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:58.520> way<00:00:59.200> so<00:01:00.370> I'll<00:01:01.370> show<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.700> how<00:01:01.850> to

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
pin it that way so I'll show you how to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.259 
pin it that way so I'll show you how to
do<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.300> little<00:01:02.510> tree<00:01:02.930> Christmas<00:01:03.860> tree<00:01:04.269> it's

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
do this little tree Christmas tree it's

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.719 
do this little tree Christmas tree it's
pretty<00:01:05.510> easy<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:08.380> have<00:01:09.380> some<00:01:09.619> other<00:01:09.800> pins<00:01:10.220> that

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
pretty easy I have some other pins that

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.810 
pretty easy I have some other pins that
I'm<00:01:10.880> doing<00:01:11.210> those<00:01:11.540> little<00:01:11.660> sand<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.820> little

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
I'm doing those little sand a little

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.240 
I'm doing those little sand a little
Merry<00:01:14.240> Christmas<00:01:14.479> now<00:01:14.930> these<00:01:15.110> will<00:01:16.100> take

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
Merry Christmas now these will take

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.190 
Merry Christmas now these will take
probably<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.729> little<00:01:16.880> bigger<00:01:17.330> pin<00:01:17.690> if<00:01:18.020> you're

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
probably a little bigger pin if you're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700 
probably a little bigger pin if you're
going<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.380> make<00:01:18.530> them<00:01:18.649> as<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> pin<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:20.710> little

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
going to make them as a pin a little

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.340 
going to make them as a pin a little
dove<00:01:22.009> some<00:01:22.880> like<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:24.009> nice<00:01:25.009> little<00:01:25.190> projects

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
dove some like that nice little projects

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.600 
dove some like that nice little projects
and<00:01:27.350> they're<00:01:27.770> pretty<00:01:28.009> easy<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:30.710> again<00:01:30.979> I

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
and they're pretty easy to do so again I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.820 
and they're pretty easy to do so again I
do<00:01:31.820> like<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> foot<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> line<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:38.289> I<00:01:39.289> have

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
do like a foot on the line and I have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.980 
do like a foot on the line and I have
this<00:01:40.390> also<00:01:41.390> cut<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:42.110> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
this also cut with the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.890 
this also cut with the
grain<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.320> cutting<00:01:49.770> winter<00:01:50.770> day<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.900> I'm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
grain so cutting winter day and I'm

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.230 
grain so cutting winter day and I'm
basically<00:01:53.200> rounding<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> off<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.369> then<00:01:55.210> I

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
basically rounding it off and then I

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.330 
basically rounding it off and then I
will<00:01:55.690> be<00:01:55.840> coming<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.320> here<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.770> coming<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.190> my

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
will be coming in here and coming to my

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:15.839 
will be coming in here and coming to my
stop<00:01:57.670> pet<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.729> stop

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.229 

so<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.739> those<00:02:20.920> two<00:02:21.159> lines<00:02:21.459> round

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
so you do that to those two lines round

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.259 
so you do that to those two lines round
it<00:02:22.389> off

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
it off

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.089 
it off
it's<00:02:25.269> actually<00:02:25.659> a<00:02:25.690> pretty<00:02:26.049> simple<00:02:26.200> thing<00:02:27.040> that

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
it's actually a pretty simple thing that

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.170 
it's actually a pretty simple thing that
you<00:02:27.430> can<00:02:27.519> do<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:30.040> know<00:02:30.159> how<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.489> round<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.940> down

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you can do you know how to round it down

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.839 
you can do you know how to round it down
on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> corners<00:02:34.470> same<00:02:35.470> thing<00:02:35.799> that's<00:02:36.099> for<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
on the corners same thing that's for a

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.690 
on the corners same thing that's for a
pin<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.150> want<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.690> make<00:02:37.780> sure<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.459> looks<00:02:39.459> nice

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
pin you want to make sure it looks nice

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.600 
pin you want to make sure it looks nice
and<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:42.340> had<00:02:42.879> an<00:02:43.060> accident

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and I had an accident

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.449 
and I had an accident
well<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.909> can't<00:02:46.420> glue<00:02:46.629> that<00:02:46.810> back<00:02:46.989> on<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.620> can

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
well I can't glue that back on or I can

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.949 
well I can't glue that back on or I can
choose<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.690> start<00:02:49.930> over<00:02:50.349> on<00:02:50.379> another<00:02:50.650> piece<00:02:51.069> so

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
choose to start over on another piece so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.460 
choose to start over on another piece so
I'll<00:02:52.959> continue

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.190 

you<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.370> glue<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:57.210> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.020> have

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you can glue that on there if you have

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.860 
you can glue that on there if you have
an<00:02:58.320> accident

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
an accident

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.570 
an accident
you<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.080> either<00:03:01.230> choose<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.920> repair<00:03:02.490> it

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
you can either choose to repair it

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.920 
you can either choose to repair it
because<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.850> doesn't<00:03:03.060> take<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.210> long<00:03:03.450> cuts

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
because it doesn't take very long cuts

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.220 
because it doesn't take very long cuts
us<00:03:04.080> out<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> pants<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:05.420> or<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:09.230> start
