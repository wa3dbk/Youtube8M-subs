00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.410
 good to all kids write to bring 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.849
 a gac analysis without cars and in-depth 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.700
 well the first thing is that you're going to have 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.519
 Spain 19 October those bus works 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.020
 on the way to Europe for 629 euros if 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.690
 maintains the same resolution hd 1280 x 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.039
 720 and texts have been improved so 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.220
 important as the battery or the 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.740
 processor that was the quad-core 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.600
 it is a soft line design with 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.300
 the very rounded edges that to all the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.800
 inspiration in nature something that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.920
 we also find in the sphere of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.300
 user not galaxy and nou 2 is 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.609
 available in two colors 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.249
 in this case white and gray is lighter 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.499
 and thin that the original model the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.229
 concrete has a thickness of 9 as 4 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.139
 millimeters and weighs 180 grams what 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.280
 gives a more stylized appearance 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:56.569
 samsung has also designed the pencil 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.479
 touch and includes this model the new s 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:01.819
 pen is longer and lighter for a home 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:05.580
 more ergonomic and coated 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:08.740
 of an anti-slip rubber-like material 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.409
 but that's not all the habitat sting of 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.300
 galaxy has left us at your request is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.310
 sensitive 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.870
 to pressure and when I open a button that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.630
 will activate certain functions 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.820
 it's no wonder that on a mobile the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.570
 Size of samsung galaxy no 2 offer 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.880
 multiple connections for is not for 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.520
 for for but without doubt the most outstanding 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.530
 is the presence of an lte chip that 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420
 will allow access to the internet to a 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 maximum speed of nothing less than 100 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.860
 megabytes in the samsung galaxy we dous 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.230
 it also has a wifi standard 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.240
 direct this this system allows the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.610
 connection between several devices to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 through wi-fi without chosen there must be a 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.540
 intermediate link with a product with 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.280
 this technology the speed of 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.460
 data transfer is much more 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.350
 quick to finish the section on 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.730
 connections on cable could not miss the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.310
 youtube port 4.0 of the gps connection and 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.410
 the nfc chip in terms of connections 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 physical with cables samsung galaxy nou 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 2 equipped microusb 2.0 port that offers 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.320
 support m activate this means with a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 cable that with a special cable we can 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.480
 launch a high definition signal to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.300
 for example to see photos or videos 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 view of the living room the micro usb also 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.470
 serves to charge the battery and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 transfer data to the computer finally 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.709
 and how could it be otherwise 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.010
 interior to the headphone division 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.650
 a 3.5 mm speaker sensor 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.080
 retro illuminated 8 megapixels this 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.900
 energy remove layer layers 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.400
 delivery glasses and the part were is for 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.110
 Take advantage of the greatest amount of light 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.180
 possible in this way we would have 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.040
 quality images even if there is little light 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.099
 the compatibilities with various 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.190
 audio formats video and image is something 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.079
 necessary in a smartphone and the samsung 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 to neighbors 2 was not going to be less than 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.940
 terminal reprocess always more almost 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 almost any kind of file some 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 it still feels in examples are mp3 wm 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:18.069
 c &amp; a other mpeg4 deep x mkv away or flv the 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.260
 sensor for Mr. 2 in an activity 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.349
 in three versions depending on the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.850
 Storage capacity to choose 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.880
 between 12 36 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.640
 64 and also allows you to send the memory 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.410
 with microsd cards up to 64 GB that 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.750
 it's not bad, we get to the last 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.270
 section of this analysis the battery a 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.070
 terminal of these characteristics with 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.420
 such a large screen a processor 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.610
 four cores 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.070
 undoubtedly you need a stack like 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.410
 disability so that the duration is 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.720
 acceptable samsung has not wanted that already 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.920
 give them to you and you have opted for a battery 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.230
 of nothing more than nothing less than 3 thousand 100 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.720
 milliamps however for the time being 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.760
 there is no data about the time of 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.640
 autonomy so it is not possible between 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.220
 in talles and well this has been everything and 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 I hope you liked to give him live 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.210
