00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.880
 and I 'm going to show you how to put 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.540
 frequency 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:13.770
 usually with glass 11 325 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 let's connect pin 10 and pin 11 to 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 2 switch that go to ground 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 can grab it from these plates or 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.560
 any negative point land of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.830
 apparatus 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 they are two common suites on and off 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:37.810
 we're going to put it on channel 15 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.810
 I'm going to show you the activated switches 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.110
 the normals will be born 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 you can see that he handles 27 135 that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.449
 corresponds to channel 15 when I activate 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 this switch this one 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.559
 corresponds to pin 11 we're going to go 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.559
 down from the normals 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.570
 26 815 when you activate this switch in the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 pin 11 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.280
 you're going to work from channel 15 to channel 27 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.120
 is the range with this switch the 27 would be 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 down channel 126 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.950
 is this I am not going to show you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.549
 although there are twenty six 955 at most what 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.060
 we go back and let's see what 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:46.680
 are the normal ones we are going to activate this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.800
 another that corresponds to pin 10 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.830
 I'm going to activate it, I got a pulse 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.140
 negative to pin 10 this is disabled 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.960
 and pin 11 is disabled only the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.650
 pin 10 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.650
 now 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.740
 we're going to leave him by fire in 15 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.220
 we can see that it handles 27 775 this range 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.030
 you will handle it from channel 1 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.030
 to channel 40 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.050
 27 605 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 and channel 40 on 28 0 45 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.130
 if I activate pin 11 and pin 10 to the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.810
 time 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.360
 we are going to go to another range of 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.870
 frequencies that are going to start from the channel 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.870
 fifteen 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.990
 27 4 55 and we are going to give you this 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.990
 27 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.080
 27595 then they could observe how 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.200
 easy is to put the frequencies in a 100 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.090
 48 you can use the tweets 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.850
 from the front or they can put us by the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.640
 back part or a box part john 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.280
 masters knew it is demonstrated here and can 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.340
 see what is pine 11 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.160
 pin 11 and pin 10 this is the eleven this is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.010
 on the 10th they take to earth and you go to 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.200
 be able to play with the frequencies this 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.870
 video the mass to show how to put 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.050
 with 11 3 25 which is the one that comes from 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.050
 factory
