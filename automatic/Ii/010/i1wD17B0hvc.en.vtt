00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 what's up guys 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 Good morning here one more day at the end touching 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.519
 engines I want to show you one 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 A little of what I'm going to see now is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.210
 the extensive BMW is that 328 and she 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 arrived here in the workshop when that car 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.689
 warm 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.769
 she gives the lightest skating on the exchange 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.009
 automatic and interesting looks just like 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 this guy is new jet a car 99 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.500
 the car is 99 is very conservative 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 even if the position of the gear box 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.059
 also that the capital where people map 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 the oil is fine here we go 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 Put there got your camera can 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.539
 focus right there then I've already 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.350
 Look here at first he's kind of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.530
 black 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 the owner reached the final if not talking about 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 is life and such beauty is also that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 You will expect this from your exchange of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.850
 Does your car break or dislike you? 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.750
 prevent and have an exchange for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.750
 run a lifetime 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 below the mechanic who put this oil 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.000
 he did not know he did not know the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.119
 correct procedure to replace 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.939
 look is a common procedure is the tip 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.759
 if the car is skating and he 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.440
 missing matiko and oil are you new 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.810
 have marketing on you pull 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.610
 you see that it is not an oil without fragment 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.460
 because normal is green 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.710
 or it is red if they have fragment 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.330
 it may be that the level is low 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.250
 most automatic cars 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.680
 you see the level worked you 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.930
 It works the engine and pull and had to see 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.730
 if you are on the level never see with the engine 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:16.250
 off but that's may be just the level 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.770
 of the low oil your car has skating 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.770
 there is the tip and mercedes 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.480
 I went back to work and then we 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.750
 here is always always nothing in the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.130
 tycoon here in the city and the four 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.130
 buffers burst 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 then I already in the genuine bought the four already 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.270
 the two are in the background and it's a car 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.420
 very chop the guys this is a car 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.300
 so I really liked that car saw the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.110
 shield is too heavy inside the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.360
 door over the sides is always 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.020
 always armored car and could not stand the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.209
 Weight 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.430
 soon she burst through another four 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.690
 agent counters besides replacing 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.640
 their shock absorbers 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.700
 we will try to adapt some springs 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.590
 are much more resistant and have a 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.980
 much thicker and that's it 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.070
 this struggle I regret today to look for where 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:29.150
 happens a leak of water this idea 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:30.560
 of hitting the engine mwm and that she arrived 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.030
 here in the workshop because the iceberg light 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.480
 is lit 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.410
 tape has already been changed that is in the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.510
 only that even passing a device does not 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.880
 Are you able to turn off the light? 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.530
 So we'll go and look for more or 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.530
 except where is this defect 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.640
 if there is anything that has connected a 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.540
 fuse blown and something of the kind 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.860
 and let's burn another day and second 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:09.020
 January 26th 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.510
 and that's it people here but if one of the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.000
 new videos or started after by video 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.530

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.510
 shake 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:26.810
 and I do not have much time for profession 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.760
 but I have learned many things and have 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.000
 cool video is to show you 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.200
 because I love doing here in the workshop 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.630
 cool things and I wish the guys 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.419
 depending on where it was critical 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.180
 which would put nothing too offensive 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.730
 something that can help me 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.380
