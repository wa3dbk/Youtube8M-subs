comfortable<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:29.130> far<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.429> our

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
comfortable for you so as far as our

comfortable for you so as far as our
hook<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> knitter<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> lot<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.710> knitters<00:00:32.009> hold

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
hook as a knitter a lot of knitters hold

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.000 
hook as a knitter a lot of knitters hold
there's<00:00:32.700> kind<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.890> would

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there's kind of like this like you would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
there's kind of like this like you would
hold<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.370> knife<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> crochet<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hold a knife and when you crochet you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.740 
hold a knife and when you crochet you
just<00:00:37.950> insert<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.570> hook<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.559> yarn<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
just insert the hook into the yarn and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.030 
just insert the hook into the yarn and
then<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> would<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.320> your<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.770> stitch

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
then you would go into your first stitch

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.569 
then you would go into your first stitch
so<00:00:44.780> that's<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.200> another<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so that's one way another way that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.520 
so that's one way another way that
people<00:00:48.090> hold<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.410> how

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
people hold it and this is actually how

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
people hold it and this is actually how
I<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.829> taught<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.160> crochet<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:51.239> crochet

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I was taught to crochet I still crochet

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
I was taught to crochet I still crochet
this<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.989> even<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> knitter<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.010> hold<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this way even as a knitter I hold it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.029 
this way even as a knitter I hold it
kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.140> guess<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.739> could<00:00:55.890> say<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
kind of like I guess you could say a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.770 
kind of like I guess you could say a
pencil<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.210> writing<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
pencil like when you're writing or a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.200 
pencil like when you're writing or a
fork<00:00:58.770> some<00:00:59.039> people<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.550> work<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.000> way

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fork some people will do work this way

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
fork some people will do work this way
but<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:01.489> far<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
but as far as I can see it's really a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.440 
but as far as I can see it's really a
lot<00:01:05.970> easier<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.780> into<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.380> stitches<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
lot easier to go into your stitches and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.630 
lot easier to go into your stitches and
loop<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> yarn<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
loop the yarn if you can see all the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250 
loop the yarn if you can see all the
pivoting<00:01:12.060> action<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
pivoting action that I have going on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
pivoting action that I have going on
here<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.680> my<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.040> hand<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.790> think

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
here with my right hand I just think

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
here with my right hand I just think
holding<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> hook<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.259> gives<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
holding the hook this way gives you a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880 
holding the hook this way gives you a
lot<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.490> movement<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.500> does<00:01:19.680> when

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
lot more movement than it does when

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
lot more movement than it does when
you're<00:01:19.979> holding<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you're holding it this way but like I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.690 
you're holding it this way but like I
said<00:01:21.960> honestly<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.890> whatever<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.549> most

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
said honestly it's whatever is most

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
said honestly it's whatever is most
comfortable<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.020> whatever<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
comfortable for you so whatever way you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.740 
comfortable for you so whatever way you
like<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.390> getting<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
like to do it if you're getting the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
like to do it if you're getting the
right<00:01:27.780> amount<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.470> stitches<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.100> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
right amount of stitches and it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
right amount of stitches and it's
looking<00:01:29.520> okay<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.390> happy<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
looking okay you're happy with it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
looking okay you're happy with it
that's<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.829> matters<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.729> those<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.000> two

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that's all that matters so those are two

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
that's all that matters so those are two
different<00:01:33.180> ways<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.750> holding<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> hook<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
different ways of holding the hook and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.569 
different ways of holding the hook and
that<00:01:34.950> brings<00:01:35.850> us<00:01:36.030> into<00:01:36.240> holding<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> yarn<00:01:37.579> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that brings us into holding the yarn so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.080 
that brings us into holding the yarn so
typically<00:01:39.680> when<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> crochet<00:01:41.040> you're<00:01:41.759> going

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
typically when you crochet you're going

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
typically when you crochet you're going
to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.299> holding<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.780> yarn<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.920> left

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to be holding your yarn in your left

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
to be holding your yarn in your left
hand<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:45.329> you're<00:01:45.630> holding<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.990> hook<00:01:46.140> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
hand because you're holding your hook in

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.469 
hand because you're holding your hook in
your<00:01:46.350> right<00:01:46.530> hand<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.979> you're<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> right-handed

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
your right hand if you're a right-handed

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
your right hand if you're a right-handed
crochet<00:01:48.479> er<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.890> way<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.520> hold<00:01:50.880> my

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
crochet er so the way that I hold my

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.170 
crochet er so the way that I hold my
yarn<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.710> tension<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> between<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.759> fingers

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
yarn is I tension it between my fingers

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
yarn is I tension it between my fingers
and<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> try<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> slow

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and I'm going to try to do this slow

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
and I'm going to try to do this slow
because<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:58.860> pretty

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
because I do it so much that I'm pretty

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.940 
because I do it so much that I'm pretty
fast<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.030> usually<00:02:00.509> tuck<00:02:01.200> my<00:02:01.500> pinky

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
fast but I usually tuck my pinky

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
fast but I usually tuck my pinky
underneath<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.090> working<00:02:03.450> yarn<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:05.270> over<00:02:06.270> my

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
underneath the working yarn and over my

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.529 
underneath the working yarn and over my
index<00:02:07.320> finger<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.610> I'll<00:02:08.700> show<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.209> again

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
index finger so I'll show you that again

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
index finger so I'll show you that again
I<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:10.410> up

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
I go up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.730 
I go up
with<00:02:12.720> my<00:02:12.870> pinkie<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.940> over<00:02:14.990> my<00:02:15.990> index<00:02:16.410> finger

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
with my pinkie and over my index finger

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.760 
with my pinkie and over my index finger
and<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.520> helps<00:02:17.910> me<00:02:18.000> tension<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.690> yarn<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.230> it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and this helps me tension my yarn and it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.260 
and this helps me tension my yarn and it
also<00:02:19.980> allows<00:02:20.700> me<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:22.080> hold<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:23.160> work<00:02:23.430> while<00:02:24.120> I'm

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
also allows me to hold my work while I'm

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
also allows me to hold my work while I'm
crocheting<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.620> I'm<00:02:25.710> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.040> tensioning

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
crocheting so I'm going to be tensioning

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.240 
crocheting so I'm going to be tensioning
my<00:02:26.700> yarn<00:02:26.970> back<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.960> between<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.860> pinkie<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
my yarn back here between my pinkie and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
my yarn back here between my pinkie and
my<00:02:29.460> ring<00:02:29.670> finger<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.210> then<00:02:31.140> I'm<00:02:31.260> also<00:02:31.380> going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
my ring finger and then I'm also going

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.140 
my ring finger and then I'm also going
to<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.770> tensioning<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.340> my<00:02:32.460> index<00:02:32.760> finger

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to be tensioning with my index finger

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
to be tensioning with my index finger
and<00:02:33.300> holding<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:33.990> work<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.070> as<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.460> holding

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and holding my work so as you're holding

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.740 
and holding my work so as you're holding
and<00:02:36.210> you're<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:37.110> into<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.470> stitches<00:02:38.750> you

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and you're going into your stitches you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.370 
and you're going into your stitches you
can<00:02:39.780> both<00:02:40.110> hold<00:02:40.410> your<00:02:40.620> work<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:42.230> tension<00:02:43.230> your

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
can both hold your work and tension your

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.940 
can both hold your work and tension your
yarn<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.630> yarn<00:02:45.630> over<00:02:45.750> your<00:02:46.020> hook<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.770> you're

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
yarn and yarn over your hook so you're

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.190 
yarn and yarn over your hook so you're
doing<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.850> when<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
doing a lot when you think about it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.640 
doing a lot when you think about it
through<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.770> whole<00:02:49.980> process<00:02:51.200> but<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
through this whole process but if you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
through this whole process but if you
take<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> look<00:02:53.280> at<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.610> back<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.300> can

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
take a look at the back here you can

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.170 
take a look at the back here you can
just<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.780> my<00:02:55.230> working<00:02:55.710> yarn<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.760> flowing

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
just see my working yarn is just flowing

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.430 
just see my working yarn is just flowing
right<00:02:57.540> through<00:02:58.340> between<00:02:59.340> my<00:02:59.460> fingers<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.140> that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
right through between my fingers so that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.610 
right through between my fingers so that
is<00:03:01.740> one<00:03:02.070> way<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> hold<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.120> yarn<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
is one way to hold your yarn but you can

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.670 
is one way to hold your yarn but you can
also<00:03:04.830> wrap<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:06.200> I've<00:03:07.200> seen<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> lot<00:03:07.620> of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
also wrap and I've seen a lot of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680 
also wrap and I've seen a lot of
knitters<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:09.000> wrap<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.660> yarn

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
knitters do this to just wrap the yarn

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.960 
knitters do this to just wrap the yarn
around<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.950> find<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.400> very<00:03:11.490> very

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
around and I find it's very very

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.180 
around and I find it's very very
difficult<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.810> tension<00:03:13.230> my<00:03:13.380> yarn<00:03:13.650> when<00:03:14.070> I'm

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
difficult to tension my yarn when I'm

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.310 
difficult to tension my yarn when I'm
doing<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.730> way<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.020> another

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
doing it that way but that is another

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.090 
doing it that way but that is another
option<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.040> yarn<00:03:17.459> over<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:19.290> know<00:03:19.410> drop<00:03:20.070> a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
option you can yarn over you know drop a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.440 
option you can yarn over you know drop a
wrap<00:03:21.380> pull<00:03:22.380> through<00:03:22.410> drop<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> wrap<00:03:23.700> yarn<00:03:24.270> over

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
wrap pull through drop a wrap yarn over

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.940 
wrap pull through drop a wrap yarn over
a<00:03:24.480> couple<00:03:24.660> more<00:03:24.870> times<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.770> little

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
a couple more times so it's a little

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.699 
a couple more times so it's a little
more<00:03:26.040> fiddly<00:03:26.489> doing<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.270> way<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.500> is

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
more fiddly doing it this way but it is

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.650 
more fiddly doing it this way but it is
an<00:03:28.830> option<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:30.300> I've<00:03:30.480> said

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
an option for you and as I've said

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
an option for you and as I've said
before<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.110> whatever<00:03:31.530> feels<00:03:32.160> most

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
before it's whatever feels most

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.710 
before it's whatever feels most
comfortable<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.300> you're<00:03:33.450> getting

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
comfortable for you if you're getting

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.750 
comfortable for you if you're getting
those<00:03:33.870> stitches<00:03:34.080> taken<00:03:34.680> care<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.950> that's<00:03:35.610> all

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
those stitches taken care of that's all

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.729 
those stitches taken care of that's all
that<00:03:35.910> matters<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.420> those<00:03:37.110> are<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.470> couple

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
that matters so those are just a couple

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.920 
that matters so those are just a couple
different<00:03:38.040> ways<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.550> holding<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> yarn<00:03:39.209> when

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
different ways of holding the yarn when

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.690 
different ways of holding the yarn when
you're<00:03:40.080> crocheting<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.920> holding<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> hook

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
you're crocheting and holding the hook

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.780 
you're crocheting and holding the hook
and<00:03:42.420> look<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:42.690> how
