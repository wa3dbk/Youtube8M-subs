first thing you unload for the muzzle at
the<00:01:02.309> front<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:04.409> reason<00:01:04.650> why<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.979> using<00:01:05.129> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the front the reason why I like using in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.350 
the front the reason why I like using in
the<00:01:05.489> support<00:01:05.850> kit<00:01:06.000> however<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:09.060> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the support kit however is it it's just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
the support kit however is it it's just
the<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.500> gun<00:01:10.650> runs<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.040> ammo<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.640> quickly

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the the gun runs out of ammo so quickly

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
the the gun runs out of ammo so quickly
because<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.200> tend<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> gun<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
because you tend to use this gun a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350 
because you tend to use this gun a
little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.369> longer<00:01:14.490> than<00:01:14.760> most<00:01:14.850> other<00:01:15.119> guns

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
little bit longer than most other guns

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
little bit longer than most other guns
and<00:01:15.680> you're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.979> firing<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.759> lot<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and you're going to be firing a lot of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
and you're going to be firing a lot of
rounds<00:01:18.780> downrange<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.860> know

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
rounds downrange and as we all know

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.880 
rounds downrange and as we all know
about<00:01:20.340> before<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:21.210> change<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.049> your

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
about before they change it so that your

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.850 
about before they change it so that your
gun<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:24.000> whenever<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.110> reload<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> lose

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
gun now whenever you reload it you lose

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.179 
gun now whenever you reload it you lose
however<00:01:26.640> much<00:01:26.850> ammo<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.240> had<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.189> however

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
however much ammo you had in the however

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.469 
however much ammo you had in the however
much<00:01:29.340> animal<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.729> left<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> clip

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
much animal you have left in the clip

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.899 
much animal you have left in the clip
you<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.780> reloaded<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.520> having

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you just reloaded so I like having

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
you just reloaded so I like having
support<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.020> myself<00:01:34.170> more<00:01:34.590> ammo<00:01:34.950> as

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
support so I can get myself more ammo as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.359 
support so I can get myself more ammo as
I<00:01:35.369> keep<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.619> characteristics<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I keep going but the characteristics of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.800 
I keep going but the characteristics of
the<00:01:38.460> gun<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.299> interesting<00:01:39.780> because

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the gun are really interesting because

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.300 
the gun are really interesting because
in<00:01:40.820> battlefield<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.630> always<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.310> guns

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
in battlefield we always know that guns

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770 
in battlefield we always know that guns
tend<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> jump<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> little<00:01:45.270> bit<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
tend to jump a little bit more at the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.090 
tend to jump a little bit more at the
first<00:01:46.020> shot<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> try<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.270> burst<00:01:48.270> fire

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
first shot so if you try and burst fire

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.289 
first shot so if you try and burst fire
that's<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.310> interesting<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.119> gun

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that's really interesting with this gun

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.789 
that's really interesting with this gun
because<00:01:51.450> instead<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:52.020> jumping<00:01:52.530> every

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
because instead of like jumping every

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
because instead of like jumping every
shot<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.369> decides<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> jump<00:01:54.659> every<00:01:54.930> couple<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
shot it decides to jump every couple of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.280 
shot it decides to jump every couple of
shots<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> very<00:01:56.130> consistent<00:01:56.759> gun<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
shots it's not a very consistent gun and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
shots it's not a very consistent gun and
I<00:01:58.290> found<00:01:58.500> myself<00:01:58.680> getting<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.399> frustrated

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
I found myself getting really frustrated

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.219 
I found myself getting really frustrated
and<00:02:00.240> dying<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.630> lot<00:02:00.780> until<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> unlocked<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
and dying a lot until I unlocked the

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.510 
and dying a lot until I unlocked the
muzzle<00:02:04.229> again<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> muzzle<00:02:05.310> suppressor

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
muzzle again the muzzle suppressor

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.029 
muzzle again the muzzle suppressor
whatever<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.829> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
whatever it is because it just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999 
whatever it is because it just
completely<00:02:08.520> tamed<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.330> jumping<00:02:10.009> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
completely tamed down the jumping of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.650 
completely tamed down the jumping of
course<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.610> made<00:02:12.060> me<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> little<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:12.510> less

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
course it made me a little bit less

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
course it made me a little bit less
effective<00:02:13.080> at<00:02:13.170> range

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
effective at range

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
effective at range
but<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.159> was<00:02:14.250> still<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:14.519> very<00:02:15.000> very<00:02:15.180> good<00:02:15.689> at

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
but it was still just very very good at

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.929 
but it was still just very very good at
keeping<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.530> gun<00:02:16.709> down<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.340> not<00:02:17.519> having<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
keeping the gun down and not having very

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.020 
keeping the gun down and not having very
much<00:02:18.150> recoil<00:02:20.689> so<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:22.079> has<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> knack<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:23.030> every

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
much recoil so it has a knack for every

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.369 
much recoil so it has a knack for every
once<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> while<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.900> said<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> got<00:02:25.349> a

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
once in a while like I said I got a

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.509 
once in a while like I said I got a
little<00:02:25.500> bit<00:02:25.709> frustrated<00:02:26.159> with<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> gun

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
little bit frustrated with the gun

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.289 
little bit frustrated with the gun
because<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.180> would<00:02:28.280> kill<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.579> large<00:02:29.879> group<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
because I would kill a large group of

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.960 
because I would kill a large group of
people<00:02:30.769> like<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.340> were<00:02:32.430> several<00:02:32.640> times

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
people like I there were several times

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.460 
people like I there were several times
throughout<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.689> gameplay<00:02:33.930> where<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.290> would

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
throughout this gameplay where I would

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 
throughout this gameplay where I would
kill<00:02:34.709> maybe<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.909> know<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.209> two<00:02:36.359> or<00:02:36.480> three

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
kill maybe you know like two or three

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
kill maybe you know like two or three
squads<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.140> raw<00:02:37.319> again<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.799> huge<00:02:38.069> kill

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
squads and raw again this huge kill

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550 
squads and raw again this huge kill
streak<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.390> die<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.930> would<00:02:40.019> come<00:02:40.409> back

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
streak and then I die I would come back

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
streak and then I die I would come back
and<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:40.890> would<00:02:40.980> probably<00:02:41.069> die<00:02:41.340> by<00:02:41.489> six<00:02:41.790> times<00:02:42.030> in

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and I would probably die by six times in

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.020 
and I would probably die by six times in
a<00:02:42.269> row<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.689> I<00:02:43.379> still<00:02:43.980> felt<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.340> same<00:02:44.609> note<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
a row and I still felt the same note and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.599 
a row and I still felt the same note and
the<00:02:45.209> gun<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:45.599> has<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> very<00:02:46.260> poor<00:02:46.739> consistency

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
the gun just has a very poor consistency

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.430 
the gun just has a very poor consistency
once<00:02:48.389> you<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.599> of<00:02:48.690> grind<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.079> way<00:02:49.230> though

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
once you kind of grind your way though

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.069 
once you kind of grind your way though
to<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.709> muzzle<00:02:50.489> suppressor<00:02:50.609> it<00:02:51.209> gets<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.780> lot

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
to that muzzle suppressor it gets a lot

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.140 
to that muzzle suppressor it gets a lot
easier<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.739> use<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:55.730> honestly<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.879> gets<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
easier to use and honestly it gets a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.990 
easier to use and honestly it gets a
little<00:02:57.510> bit<00:02:57.690> more<00:02:57.810> consistent<00:02:58.409> but<00:02:59.159> it's<00:02:59.670> just

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
little bit more consistent but it's just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.509 
little bit more consistent but it's just
not<00:03:00.209> quite<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.959> same<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.829> it's<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.430> just

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
not quite the same and it's a it's just

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.610 
not quite the same and it's a it's just
a<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:05.849> inconsistent<00:03:06.299> gun<00:03:06.689> but<00:03:07.379> if<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.590> use

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
a very inconsistent gun but if you use

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.990 
a very inconsistent gun but if you use
it<00:03:08.010> enough<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.519> start<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> kind<00:03:08.879> of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
it enough and you start to kind of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.429 
it enough and you start to kind of
figure<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.480> grind<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.959> weapon<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
figure out the grind of the weapon and

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.349 
figure out the grind of the weapon and
start<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.739> kind<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.920> figure<00:03:11.069> out<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> feel<00:03:11.639> you

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
start to kind of figure out the feel you

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.479 
start to kind of figure out the feel you
can<00:03:12.540> definitely<00:03:12.750> start<00:03:13.349> getting<00:03:14.129> much<00:03:14.310> more

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
can definitely start getting much more

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.309 
can definitely start getting much more
consistent<00:03:14.819> by<00:03:15.120> yourself<00:03:15.599> with<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> gun<00:03:16.079> and

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
consistent by yourself with the gun and

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.259 
consistent by yourself with the gun and
it<00:03:17.069> tends<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.579> take<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.879> more<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.120> more

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
it tends to take out more and more

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.800 
it tends to take out more and more
people<00:03:19.579> all<00:03:20.579> right<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.150> anyway<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.449> has<00:03:21.690> been

about<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.489> gun

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
about the gun

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.000 
about the gun
this<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.730> little<00:04:10.970> PostScript<00:04:11.710> it<00:04:12.710> was<00:04:12.830> more

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
this is a little PostScript it was more

about<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.280> setup<00:04:13.520> is<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.270> like<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:14.840> a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
about the setup is that I like to have a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.900 
about the setup is that I like to have a
trusted<00:04:15.680> pistol<00:04:16.040> with<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.310> because<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.730> ammo

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
trusted pistol with you because the ammo

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.530 
trusted pistol with you because the ammo
runs<00:04:17.239> out<00:04:17.480> rather<00:04:17.900> quickly<00:04:18.050> on<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.620> gun

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
runs out rather quickly on the gun

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.190 
runs out rather quickly on the gun
especially<00:04:20.540> when<00:04:20.660> you're<00:04:20.780> trying<00:04:20.930> not<00:04:21.080> to

especially when you're trying not to

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.960 
especially when you're trying not to
waste<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:21.739> much<00:04:21.800> ammo<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:22.730> don't

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
waste so much ammo so that you don't

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.280
