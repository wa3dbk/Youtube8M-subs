their dog to get sat in one weekend then

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.710 
their dog to get sat in one weekend then
they<00:03:23.160> will<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.670> kids<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.000> be<00:03:24.060> babysat<00:03:24.480> in

they will for the kids to be babysat in
two<00:03:24.989> hours<00:03:26.750> like<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.810> doesn't<00:03:28.049> sound<00:03:28.410> that

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
two hours like that doesn't sound that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.879 
two hours like that doesn't sound that
doesn't<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.489> sounds<00:03:29.880> right<00:03:30.150> but

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
doesn't that sounds right but

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.750 
doesn't that sounds right but
realistically<00:03:31.889> like<00:03:32.040> at<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.310> time<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.700> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
realistically like at the time but you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
realistically like at the time but you
go<00:03:32.880> over<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> their<00:03:33.180> house<00:03:33.329> every<00:03:33.510> day<00:03:33.630> adds<00:03:33.959> up

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
go over to their house every day adds up

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.420 
go over to their house every day adds up
to<00:03:34.290> probably<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.889> two<00:03:35.010> hours<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.370> you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to probably like the two hours that you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.920 
to probably like the two hours that you
would<00:03:35.549> spend<00:03:35.700> babysitting<00:03:36.239> kids<00:03:36.450> per<00:03:36.690> night

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
would spend babysitting kids per night

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.220 
would spend babysitting kids per night
