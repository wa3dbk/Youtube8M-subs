hour<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.189> might<00:01:52.369> be<00:01:52.549> worth<00:01:52.700> taking<00:01:52.939> on

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
hour and it might be worth taking on

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.899 
hour and it might be worth taking on
board<00:01:53.539> some<00:01:53.810> extra<00:01:54.350> carbohydrate<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.610> between

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
30 and 60 grams so some people like to

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.760 
30 and 60 grams so some people like to
have<00:01:59.330> daily<00:01:59.600> beans<00:01:59.869> some<00:02:00.229> people<00:02:00.560> have<00:02:00.740> a

have daily beans some people have a

my<00:02:05.509> advice<00:02:05.840> would<00:02:06.080> be<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.590> if<00:02:06.770> you're

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
my advice would be that if you're

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.440 
my advice would be that if you're
training<00:02:07.310> for<00:02:07.429> competition

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
training for competition

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.440 
training for competition
try<00:02:08.959> out<00:02:09.200> all<00:02:09.560> these<00:02:09.709> things<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.450> beforehand

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
try out all these things in beforehand

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.270 
try out all these things in beforehand
in<00:02:11.780> your<00:02:11.989> practice<00:02:12.440> run<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.069> don't

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
in your practice run so that you don't

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
in your practice run so that you don't
get<00:02:13.549> competition<00:02:14.239> day<00:02:14.420> hovervan<00:02:15.260> honor<00:02:15.410> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
get competition day hovervan honor and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.770 
get competition day hovervan honor and
by<00:02:15.830> gravity<00:02:16.310> gives<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.610> stomach<00:02:16.940> upset<00:02:19.780> after

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
by gravity gives you stomach upset after

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.900 
by gravity gives you stomach upset after
24<00:02:21.380> strings<00:02:21.650> are<00:02:21.860> another<00:02:22.069> good<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.519> drink

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
24 strings are another good one to drink

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.000 
24 strings are another good one to drink
during<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.390> exercise<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.110> its<00:02:24.380> 4<00:02:24.650> miles<00:02:24.830> an

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
during the exercise of its 4 miles an

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
during the exercise of its 4 miles an
hour<00:02:25.160> because<00:02:25.940> these<00:02:26.299> will<00:02:26.480> help<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
hour because these will help to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.990 
hour because these will help to
replenish<00:02:27.170> both<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.950> water<00:02:28.280> stores<00:02:28.700> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
replenish both your water stores and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.090 
replenish both your water stores and
also<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.989> electrolytes<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.980> you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
also all of the electrolytes that you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.800 
also all of the electrolytes that you
lose<00:02:31.310> through<00:02:31.610> sweat<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.940> after<00:02:35.390> access<00:02:35.690> that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
lose through sweat so after access that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.660 
lose through sweat so after access that
I<00:02:35.870> say<00:02:36.110> with<00:02:36.319> anything<00:02:36.739> less<00:02:36.920> than<00:02:37.130> an<00:02:37.250> hour<00:02:37.400> I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
I say with anything less than an hour I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.120 
I say with anything less than an hour I
just<00:02:37.700> say<00:02:38.150> happy<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.660> normal<00:02:39.170> meal<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:39.709> normal

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
for anything more than an hour then you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.910 
for anything more than an hour then you
need<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:44.660> on<00:02:44.900> board<00:02:45.109> quite<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> lot<00:02:45.859> of

need to take on board quite a lot of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.099 
need to take on board quite a lot of
fluid<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.549> replace<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.239> anything<00:02:47.959> you've

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
fluid to replace and anything you've

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.759 
fluid to replace and anything you've
lost<00:02:48.290> me<00:02:48.590> sweat<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.760> work<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.420> how<00:02:50.810> much<00:02:51.019> fluid

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
lost me sweat to work out how much fluid

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.500 
lost me sweat to work out how much fluid
you're<00:02:51.980> actually<00:02:52.280> losing<00:02:52.790> if<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.359> weigh

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you're actually losing if you weigh

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.319 
you're actually losing if you weigh
yourself<00:02:53.660> before<00:02:54.260> exercise<00:02:54.859> and<00:02:55.190> after<00:02:55.730> that

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
yourself before exercise and after that

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.630 
yourself before exercise and after that
we'll<00:02:56.570> let<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.900> know<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.829> litres<00:02:58.250> how<00:02:58.489> much

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
we'll let you know in litres how much

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.979 
we'll let you know in litres how much
water<00:02:58.880> you've<00:02:59.090> lost<00:02:59.299> so<00:02:59.540> if<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.780> lose<00:02:59.930> a

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
water you've lost so if you lose a

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.770 
water you've lost so if you lose a
kilogram<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.920> kilogram<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> liter<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.239> fluid

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
kilogram a kilogram is a liter of fluid

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.650 
kilogram a kilogram is a liter of fluid
and<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.380> actually<00:03:03.590> need<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:03.920> take<00:03:04.190> on<00:03:04.400> board

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
and you actually need to take on board

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.800 
and you actually need to take on board
1.2<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.959> 1.5<00:03:06.680> times<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.370> amount<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:08.030> you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
1.2 to 1.5 times this amount and you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.840 
1.2 to 1.5 times this amount and you
might<00:03:08.959> be<00:03:09.109> worth<00:03:09.230> adding<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.829> pinch<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.250> salt<00:03:10.489> or

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
might be worth adding a pinch of salt or

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.840 
might be worth adding a pinch of salt or
having<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.930> water<00:03:12.140> as<00:03:12.590> an<00:03:12.859> electrolyte<00:03:13.310> drink

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
having the water as an electrolyte drink

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.150 
having the water as an electrolyte drink
and<00:03:14.090> still<00:03:14.930> helps<00:03:15.230> your<00:03:15.319> body<00:03:15.440> tribes<00:03:15.799> or<00:03:16.010> be

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
and still helps your body tribes or be

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.830 
and still helps your body tribes or be
even<00:03:16.430> better<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.579> food<00:03:20.030> rice<00:03:20.269> need<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.720> be

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
even better so food rice need to be

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.590 
even better so food rice need to be
making<00:03:21.260> sure<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.650> you're<00:03:21.859> replacing<00:03:22.100> their

and protein stores which is what's going

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.590 
and protein stores which is what's going
