00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so I'm going to show you a little trick

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.540 
so I'm going to show you a little trick
of<00:00:48.030> how<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> create<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.620> sexy<00:00:50.129> very

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
of how to create very sexy very

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.130 
of how to create very sexy very
beautiful<00:00:51.000> ways<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.449> simply<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> section

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
beautiful ways very simply the section

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
beautiful ways very simply the section
is<00:00:55.199> roughly<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> size<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
is roughly the size of this and you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.930 
is roughly the size of this and you
would<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.809> two<00:00:57.960> fingers<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> wrap<00:00:59.399> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
hair around it just like a string you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.690 
hair around it just like a string you
feed<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> ends<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.960> through<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.309> center

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
feed the ends right through the center

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.100 
feed the ends right through the center
of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> loop<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> take<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.490> now

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
of the loop then you take this right now

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
of the loop then you take this right now
you<00:01:10.110> clamp<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.619> outside<00:01:11.540> for<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:12.630> two

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you clamp on the outside for about two

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.290 
you clamp on the outside for about two
seconds<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.190 

so<00:01:17.870> their<00:01:18.050> hairs<00:01:18.260> nicely<00:01:18.830> warmed<00:01:19.040> up<00:01:19.340> now<00:01:20.200> you

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
so their hairs nicely warmed up now you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.180 
so their hairs nicely warmed up now you
take<00:01:21.230> another<00:01:21.650> clip<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.170> let<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.410> sit<00:01:24.680> you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
take another clip and you let it sit you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.680 
take another clip and you let it sit you
wanna<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.520> yourself<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:26.270> course<00:01:26.510> it

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
wanna try this yourself of course it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.780 
wanna try this yourself of course it
let's<00:01:26.810> do<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:26.960> easy<00:01:27.230> okay<00:01:27.710> go<00:01:27.920> for<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.520> what

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
let's do it easy okay go for it so what

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.050 
let's do it easy okay go for it so what
you<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.240> take<00:01:29.990> two<00:01:30.560> fingers<00:01:30.880> wrap<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
it cheat the ends right to the center of

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.950 
it cheat the ends right to the center of
the<00:01:36.740> loop<00:01:37.150> very<00:01:38.150> good<00:01:38.360> now<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.690> take<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
the loop very good now you take the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.260 
the loop very good now you take the
straightener<00:01:40.990> clamp<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:43.310> gently<00:01:43.370> so<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
straightener clamp it very gently so the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.370 
straightener clamp it very gently so the
hair<00:01:44.480> really<00:01:44.720> nicely<00:01:44.990> warms<00:01:45.410> up<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:48.110> then<00:01:48.260> you

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
hair really nicely warms up and then you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.830 
hair really nicely warms up and then you
