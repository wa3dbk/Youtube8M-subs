believe that that fireline can actually
slip<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> knot<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.850> happen<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
slip out of a knot but it can happen and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
slip out of a knot but it can happen and
so<00:01:57.979> sometimes<00:01:58.979> people<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.670> tell<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.880> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so sometimes people will tell you that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850 
so sometimes people will tell you that
you<00:02:00.240> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> surgeon's<00:02:01.439> knot<00:02:01.649> when

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you need to use a surgeon's knot when

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
you need to use a surgeon's knot when
you're<00:02:01.979> using<00:02:02.159> fireline<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.939> particular<00:02:03.450> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you're using fireline in particular I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
you're using fireline in particular I
still<00:02:04.799> generally<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> half-hitch<00:02:06.119> knot

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
still generally use a half-hitch knot

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.529 
still generally use a half-hitch knot
unless<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.310> spot<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:08.970> it's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
unless I'm in a spot where it's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.470 
unless I'm in a spot where it's
especially<00:02:10.289> loose<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.330> make

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
especially loose and then I want to make

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.440 
especially loose and then I want to make
sure<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.870> make

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
sure that I make

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
sure that I make
tighten<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.080> on<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.650> hold<00:02:14.920> those<00:02:15.400> threads

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
tighten it on up and hold those threads

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.339 
tighten it on up and hold those threads
together<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.390> then<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.930> surgeon's

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
together and then I go to a surgeon's

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.080 
together and then I go to a surgeon's
knot<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.220> let<00:02:18.340> me<00:02:18.430> show<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.819> make<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
knot so let me show you how to make a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.270 
knot so let me show you how to make a
surgeon's<00:02:19.510> knot<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:20.140> almost<00:02:20.470> exactly<00:02:20.709> like

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
surgeon's knot it's almost exactly like

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.220 
surgeon's knot it's almost exactly like
a<00:02:21.340> half<00:02:21.610> hitch<00:02:21.819> knot<00:02:22.060> with<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.630> extra<00:02:23.110> little

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
a half hitch knot with one extra little

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.970 
a half hitch knot with one extra little
loop<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> just<00:02:27.040> created<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.640> piece<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.180> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
loop so here I just created a piece of a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.699 
loop so here I just created a piece of a
peyote<00:02:29.980> stitch<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.600> only<00:02:31.810> reason<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.230> use

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
peyote stitch so the only reason I use

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.110 
peyote stitch so the only reason I use
peyote<00:02:33.040> stitch<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.700> was<00:02:33.790> quick

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
peyote stitch was because it was quick

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.809 
peyote stitch was because it was quick
and<00:02:34.150> fast<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:34.720> me<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.840> stitch<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.680> here<00:02:36.100> for<00:02:36.700> my

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
and fast for me to stitch up here for my

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.059 
and fast for me to stitch up here for my
demo<00:02:37.090> piece<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.989> what<00:02:38.110> I'm<00:02:38.170> gonna<00:02:38.260> do<00:02:38.530> which<00:02:38.950> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
demo piece and what I'm gonna do which I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.259 
demo piece and what I'm gonna do which I
normally<00:02:39.130> wouldn't<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.209> to

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
normally wouldn't do is I'm going to

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.970 
normally wouldn't do is I'm going to
actually<00:02:40.420> create<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:40.989> knot<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> outside

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
actually create this knot on the outside

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.580 
actually create this knot on the outside
edge<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:43.420> piece<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.840> bead<00:02:43.989> weaving<00:02:44.230> so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
edge of this piece of bead weaving so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.100 
edge of this piece of bead weaving so
that<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:45.010> see<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.400> little<00:02:45.580> bit<00:02:45.730> better

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
that you can see it a little bit better

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.570 
that you can see it a little bit better
normally<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.140> would<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.680> creating<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.340> knot

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
normally I would be creating this knot

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.390 
normally I would be creating this knot
right<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.569> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.350> center<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:51.010> somewhere

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
right on in the center here somewhere

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.009 
right on in the center here somewhere
because<00:02:51.610> I'm<00:02:51.730> wanting<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.239> hide<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.840> knot

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
because I'm wanting to hide the knot

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.680 
because I'm wanting to hide the knot
inside<00:02:53.580> that's<00:02:54.580> why<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> wouldn't<00:02:55.150> put<00:02:55.569> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
inside that's why I wouldn't put the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.750 
inside that's why I wouldn't put the
knot<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> outside<00:02:56.530> edge<00:02:56.739> here<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.310> because

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
knot on the outside edge here is because

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.199 
knot on the outside edge here is because
I<00:02:58.239> wouldn't<00:02:58.870> want<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.230> show<00:02:59.470> but<00:03:00.370> all<00:03:00.940> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
I wouldn't want it to show but all the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.150 
I wouldn't want it to show but all the
steps<00:03:01.450> are<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> same<00:03:01.780> whether<00:03:02.739> you're<00:03:03.010> doing

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
steps are the same whether you're doing

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.680 
steps are the same whether you're doing
it<00:03:03.370> on<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.610> outside<00:03:03.640> or<00:03:04.269> whether<00:03:04.420> you're

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it on the outside or whether you're

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.140 
it on the outside or whether you're
doing<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.080> on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.319> inside<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
doing it on the inside so just like a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.000 
doing it on the inside so just like a
half<00:03:07.390> hitch<00:03:07.630> knot<00:03:07.660> you're<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.290> gonna<00:03:08.380> find<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
half hitch knot you're just gonna find a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.250 
half hitch knot you're just gonna find a
thread<00:03:09.340> intersection<00:03:10.060> that's<00:03:10.299> nearby<00:03:10.630> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
thread intersection that's nearby and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.910 
thread intersection that's nearby and
hook<00:03:11.890> your<00:03:12.160> needle<00:03:12.610> underneath<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.299> thread

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
hook your needle underneath the thread

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.890 
hook your needle underneath the thread
you're<00:03:14.920> gonna<00:03:15.010> pull<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.760> down<00:03:16.120> you're<00:03:16.569> working

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
you're gonna pull it down you're working

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.569 
you're gonna pull it down you're working
threads<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.440> you've<00:03:17.620> got<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.799> little<00:03:18.100> bit<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
threads that you've got a little bit of

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.000 
threads that you've got a little bit of
a<00:03:18.670> loop<00:03:18.910> again<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.019> smaller<00:03:20.320> your<00:03:20.560> loop<00:03:20.799> is

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
a loop again the smaller your loop is

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.490 
a loop again the smaller your loop is
the<00:03:21.370> less<00:03:22.030> likely<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.989> prematurely

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
the less likely it is to prematurely

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.009 
the less likely it is to prematurely
knot<00:03:23.799> on<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.220> you're<00:03:25.120> going<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.299> go<00:03:25.450> ahead<00:03:25.570> and

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
knot on you you're going to go ahead and

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.099 
knot on you you're going to go ahead and
pass<00:03:26.320> your<00:03:27.010> working<00:03:27.700> thread<00:03:27.970> through<00:03:28.630> the

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
pass your working thread through the

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.080 
pass your working thread through the
loop<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> way<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.340> would<00:03:30.579> with<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.880> half

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
loop just the way you would with a half

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.569 
loop just the way you would with a half
hitch<00:03:31.329> knot<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:32.709> at<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.010> point<00:03:33.280> basically

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
hitch knot here at this point basically

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.400 
hitch knot here at this point basically
what<00:03:33.970> we've<00:03:34.120> done<00:03:34.299> is<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.480> half<00:03:34.720> hitch<00:03:34.930> knot<00:03:34.959> and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
what we've done is a half hitch knot and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.160 
what we've done is a half hitch knot and
so<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.650> we<00:03:35.799> shut<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.609> down<00:03:37.000> let's<00:03:37.600> continue

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
so if we shut this down let's continue

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.710 
so if we shut this down let's continue
tightening<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.859> close<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.250> down<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.850> itself

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
tightening and close it down on itself

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.349 
tightening and close it down on itself
then<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.680> will<00:03:41.890> be<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> half<00:03:42.250> hitch<00:03:42.519> knot<00:03:42.790> but

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
then that will be a half hitch knot but

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.849 
then that will be a half hitch knot but
what<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.570> want<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.930> actually<00:03:44.079> do<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.709> make

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
what I want to actually do here is make

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.620 
what I want to actually do here is make
a<00:03:44.920> surgeon's<00:03:45.459> knot<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.180> only<00:03:46.359> difference

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
a surgeon's knot so the only difference

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.530 
a surgeon's knot so the only difference
is<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:47.980> going<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> same<00:03:49.299> direction

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
is that now going in the same direction

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.690 
is that now going in the same direction
that<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.049> did<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.440> first<00:03:50.590> time<00:03:50.890> I'm<00:03:51.190> gonna<00:03:51.459> go

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
that I did the first time I'm gonna go

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.240 
that I did the first time I'm gonna go
through<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:51.970> loop<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.480> second<00:03:53.019> time<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:54.780> then

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
through that loop a second time and then

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.280 
through that loop a second time and then
now<00:03:57.250> I've<00:03:57.430> got<00:03:57.609> two<00:03:57.910> loops<00:03:58.150> around<00:03:58.720> here<00:03:59.109> and

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
now I've got two loops around here and

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.860 
now I've got two loops around here and
now<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.769> I<00:03:59.799> tighten<00:04:00.340> down<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.090> again<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> want

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
now as I tighten down and again I want

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.720 
now as I tighten down and again I want
to<00:04:01.930> do<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.109> nice<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.500> slowly<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.400> if<00:04:03.579> I

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
to do it nice and slowly so that if I

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.819 
to do it nice and slowly so that if I
see<00:04:03.760> any<00:04:04.180> premature<00:04:04.630> knotting<00:04:05.260> going<00:04:05.680> on

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
see any premature knotting going on

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.130 
see any premature knotting going on
meaning<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.060> knotting<00:04:07.480> out<00:04:07.630> here

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
meaning that it's knotting out here

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.170 
meaning that it's knotting out here
instead<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.680> right<00:04:08.829> now<00:04:09.010> next<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.549> beads<00:04:09.819> I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
instead of right now next to the beads I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.890 
instead of right now next to the beads I
can<00:04:10.359> stop<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.459> fix<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:12.700> before<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.180> gets<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.810> be

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
can stop and fix it before it gets to be

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.529 
can stop and fix it before it gets to be
too<00:04:13.930> late<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:15.040> now<00:04:15.160> as<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.489> tighten<00:04:15.819> down<00:04:15.850> there

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
too late so now as I tighten down there

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.090 
too late so now as I tighten down there
we<00:04:16.660> go<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.989> tightened<00:04:17.320> right<00:04:17.560> down<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
we go it tightened right down to the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.580 
we go it tightened right down to the
beads<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.720> extra<00:04:20.109> loop<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.470> thread

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
beads and that extra loop of thread

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.399 
beads and that extra loop of thread
makes<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.160> huge<00:04:21.609> difference<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:22.390> how<00:04:22.630> secure

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
makes a huge difference in how secure

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:27.360 
makes a huge difference in how secure
that<00:04:23.800> knot<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:25.440> when<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.470> do<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.800> half<00:04:27.099> hitch

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
that knot is when I do a half hitch

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.550 
that knot is when I do a half hitch
not<00:04:27.550> let<00:04:27.790> me<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.120> one<00:04:28.510> more<00:04:28.720> time<00:04:28.780> for<00:04:29.470> you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
not let me do this one more time for you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.950 
not let me do this one more time for you
real<00:04:29.740> quick<00:04:29.910> when<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:30.940> do<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.120> half-hitch<00:04:31.449> knot<00:04:31.510> I

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
real quick when I do a half-hitch knot I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.629 
real quick when I do a half-hitch knot I
tell<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.830> does<00:04:32.949> not<00:04:33.070> matter<00:04:33.310> whether

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
tell you that it does not matter whether

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.490 
tell you that it does not matter whether
you<00:04:33.729> go<00:04:33.970> front<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.419> back<00:04:34.600> or<00:04:35.020> back<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.320> front

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
you go front to back or back to front

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.550 
you go front to back or back to front
through<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.280> loop<00:04:36.729> that's<00:04:37.360> still<00:04:37.750> true<00:04:38.139> of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
through the loop that's still true of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.159 
through the loop that's still true of
the<00:04:38.919> surgeon's<00:04:39.400> knot<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.419> thing<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.840> that<00:04:41.050> you

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
the surgeon's knot the thing is that you

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.230 
the surgeon's knot the thing is that you
need<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.410> be<00:04:41.680> consistent<00:04:42.130> about<00:04:42.669> how<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:42.970> go

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
need to be consistent about how you go

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.290 
need to be consistent about how you go
through<00:04:43.479> that<00:04:43.600> loop<00:04:43.810> for<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.169> second<00:04:44.680> pass<00:04:45.550> so

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
through that loop for the second pass so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.540 
through that loop for the second pass so
if<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.750> went<00:04:46.930> front<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.590> back<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.340> first

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
if you went front to back for the first

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.950 
if you went front to back for the first
time<00:04:48.790> then<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.030> need<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.270> go<00:04:49.389> front<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.720> back

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
time then you need to go front to back

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.480 
time then you need to go front to back
for<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.290> second<00:04:50.650> time<00:04:50.830> okay<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:53.430> this<00:04:54.430> is

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
for the second time okay and this is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.790 
for the second time okay and this is
even<00:04:55.030> more<00:04:55.330> likely<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:55.840> prematurely<00:04:56.320> not<00:04:56.590> on

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
even more likely to prematurely not on

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.270 
even more likely to prematurely not on
you<00:04:57.010> so<00:04:57.250> be<00:04:57.490> really<00:04:58.270> slow<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.229> careful<00:04:59.770> as<00:05:00.010> you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
you so be really slow and careful as you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.029 
you so be really slow and careful as you
tighten<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:00.820> on<00:05:01.000> down<00:05:01.620> into<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:03.070> space<00:05:03.340> so

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
tighten that on down into the space so

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.500 
tighten that on down into the space so
that's<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.160> way<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.310> make<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.699> surgeon's<00:05:07.300> knot

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
that's a way to make a surgeon's knot

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.840 
that's a way to make a surgeon's knot
that<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.139> will<00:05:08.380> be<00:05:08.530> even<00:05:08.800> more<00:05:09.220> secure<00:05:09.610> than<00:05:09.760> a

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
that it will be even more secure than a

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.930 
that it will be even more secure than a
half-hitch<00:05:10.210> knot<00:05:11.280> little<00:05:12.280> tricks<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.699> make

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
half-hitch knot little tricks that make

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:24.410 
half-hitch knot little tricks that make
bead<00:05:13.360> weaving<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.900> lot<00:05:14.080> more<00:05:14.350> easy

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.480
