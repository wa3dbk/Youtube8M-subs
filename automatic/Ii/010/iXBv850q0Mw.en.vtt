00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 many people it was a lease 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.620
 we did not talk about one piece between 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.720
 chapters that are not out of the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 week at all a chapter where I have not 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.970
 because I had that we are there 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.290
 finally 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 so the chapters property actually 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.099
 talking to us shows us fighting in 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 did others not demolished houara but d 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.960
 other captains who was part of the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.520
 big tournament that has been held since blues 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 since a lease but we are shown 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.519
 especially what the fight of these and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 I think it's not for nothing 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.980
 believe that in fact these characters will be 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.240
 very important in the following of the manga 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 why because in the last 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.759
 chapter on which one leaves one puts moreau 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.649
 we let go when he sees so the son 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
 when we see the son or nephews at 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 more in any case a family member 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.579
 so from 2 skin to skin family finally 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 country dudu flowers country flower 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 finally here at pau navy see France is 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 but in any case his canton see 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.920
 the heir who's super strong and who has 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
 acquired able to break the continent of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.699
 ice cream that even well they finally 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 could before but in any case 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.140
 the heir of the fat 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 kiri technique you know machin trick 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.189
 no one will say by you see who I 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 speak what you see that guy happens to 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.610
 to bury 20 he did not have the jaws for 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.659
 me of a person who had the class I 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 believe that you will be more or less 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.080
 okay he had not we see his 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 mouth we see rather a henchman 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.320
 or what are we going to see nothing sailboats 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.450
 that's incredible for me but we 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.479
 see when this one arrives already before 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.070
 besides putting down a little 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.509
 passage and who communicates with baby file 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.450
 we mainly learn why b8 bankruptcy 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.770
 always there between 2 and 6 and 2 to stick 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 the guy who supposedly need it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.320
 because she was dismissed that with 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.540
 kids but hey it's a small passage 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.829
 yet sad as what you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 lacombe men whose kivu is and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.290
 family you're alone all 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.540
 abused from the ground up the right vote and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.820
 so after this little passage so we see 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.579
 this guy who gets to goal and especially the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 audi the successful audi who was in 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.180
 oneself a kind of big old muscles 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 baby who was limited in diaper 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.210
 is another who looks but he had 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.500
 a technique that looks a lot like 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.250
 a Chilean they will have again 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.479
 super muscular and everything but that's not it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 the important thing is to know that 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.489
 this decree does not give china zhao so to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.620
 reus stomped the guy who stumbled ginger 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.860
 finally good to jigawa to avoid that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.390
 yeah here I have not yet totally 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.849
 recovered fighting against him made fit 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 here is a homo couple against mu will have so 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.220
 that may explain why he had 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.140
 problems because the guy c't'un 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.730
 guy of 500 million koala tickets or 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.989
 10 years has even passed who he came whore 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.209
 and kill him someone even if he is a 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.650
 little older turns the guy who was 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.450
 supposed to have recovered his ultimate trick 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.890
 the ring holding his fake skull in 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.599
 form of spades technically they 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.739
 could have and techniques the most 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.819
 deadly so now 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.900
 unfortunately I think it's 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.549
 actually that he had been able to recover 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.140
 fighting against the son a little normal 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.610
 the guy he took a giant attack that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.870
 had even put down who was well 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.680
 more powerful than the attacker who set 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 earth for example 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.079
 finally who had hurt to death and who 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.370
 had he given that they had given 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.500
 the favored son you are so I speak 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.359
 heading and who did like the kit 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.519
 is con who had cashed the war 3 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.599
 like that by challenge and regretted by the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.220
 following and that's what caused his loss 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.930
 afterwards a good that so for in 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.519
 come back this fight if after after so the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.190
 audi who got his ass kicked and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.440
 big five so we see one as at the end 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940
 so a kind of little frame you see 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.650
 so the winner the loser thing trick 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.079
 is the floor so it reminds me a lot 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.180
 in the fight you see each of the 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.400
 fights sent kind victory sanji 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.380
 victorz homage and where I want him 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.790
 to say where sorry I meant in 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.620
 big that these people will be important 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.849
 it's the novel land 2 euros actually 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.319
 that he had already heard that name 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.579
 somewhere I'll try to get some 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.849
 remember it might be helpful by the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.819
 after 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.049
 why is it like that I just 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.639
 it's not so interesting that 50 of the tac 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.019
 but it's mostly to tell us that in 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.310
 big the author wants to get through that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.700
 that this is perceived there will have to be 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.950
 memory 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.030
 cd no that it will be necessary to remember and this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.590
 will probably be words that 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.510
 will return in the great final war 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.430
 of the end of a track that will oppose 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.290
 all luffy pals against marie 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 day against all all marie joy so 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.230
 a second star that is so is at the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.699
 times of this fight I think 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.930
 now all cases live a fight 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.579
 now will obviously be present the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.440
 end of the god of the world 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.299
 so after we have a small vaulted passage 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.099
 with a long time led of 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:08.650
 quiros with so urban quiros that 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.879
 always at the hands against diamond and I 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.530
 I thought it was going to be a fight 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.109
 synthesis and especially that I like a lot 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.000
 I really like I had a lot who 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.349
 reflected in the manga because finally 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.209
 in the night during because this one 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.030
 in fact to the you 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.979
 from takamura on me look like this 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.100
 if not it but he has the same doubler 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.720
 that takamura of hajime no ippo is a 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.250
 comrade hakim of the american ipos 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.479
 balls and I just found happy I 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.380
 could not have too many better ways 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.800
 for quiros who is definitely the man 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.410
 all the stuff 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.759
 in short the guy still had a survive 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.530
 despite losing one leg 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.270
 know how was his level of 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.530
 even with both jeans finally level 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.970
 speed nor your displacements 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.770
 in any case she manages to hold her head 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.270
 quickly made a diamond of the same one here 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.130
 banging and doing c18 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.099
 to love a beautiful love because that's it 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.210
 still makes sail has made stress for 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.320
 all but obviously shooting at caylar 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.430
 unfortunately by train dice if the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.139
 protect at the same time and as said 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.000
 rebecca actually it's a big 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.370
 ball which now is a hair 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.960
 akiro to fight to fight 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.460
 kindly proposes yes I tell you everything 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.410
 unfortunately quiros like and years 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.229
 when he was too often said soudas 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.909
 is the cause of this rebecca change 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.400
 little girl in big big 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.690
 gladiators this one now that he 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.550
 is once again a human never again 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.840
 let rebecca and raise a sword but 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.430
 me what I think is that in the end 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.020
 obviously the two flights unite their 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.050
 forces because with a wood that's 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.310
 perception but observation or 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.630
 perception in office anyway he has 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.159
 a beautiful a good asset to be able to 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.710
 detect attacks and summer pastures and 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.669
 saying to themselves and quiros will know I do not 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.719
 do not even know because they were too 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.159
 surely played for very very 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.570
 a long time so already the fact that they 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.719
 can fight like that easy 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.280
 easy it's amazing but now so 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.419
 their fight will continue apart in my 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.699
 big thing that nothing pro in the east at 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.740
 level of the very beautiful the surfer and 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.300
 the picaros is nothing that really 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.259
 progressed at the level of these three there 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.340
 it's more important but it's 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.219
 certainly the last ones who go there 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.810
 fight and so in the end we mostly go 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.060
 the most important is especially 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.639
 cavendish that goes into mode mode 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.840
 berserk so know who because 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.130
 when he fought in the tournament he 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.860
 needed the same thing he went 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.090
 in this weird mode or basically I know 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.080
 more how we call it good either in 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.000
 anyway he went into this mode 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.860
 weird where the mines where it's super 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.479
 scary and goal everyone so 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.889
 it was he who had won but in the end 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.090
 he becomes conscious so what is this 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.370
 will happen here it's the same way 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.479
 the mound and so dellinger who I 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.400
 I did not have very much 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.229
 understood but descends fish from 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.219
 men fish fighters paul 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.180
 I do not really run up to the 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.620
 a little messy translation 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.940
 so I had thought of men 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.530
 fish what because if you look 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.720
 he has this little shark fin of re 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.370
 with the barracuda creature cap 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.320
 mashala who was in who swam 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.360
 around the ring in the tournament whose 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.770
 colosseum so I told myself this is 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.040
 maybe it's actually the result of 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.540
 daemon 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.280
 but there I do not really see I do not see 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.810
 exactly but it makes you crazy considering that 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.430
 anyway he blew himself up so 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.810
 by cavendish and we do not know what 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.080
 will happen by that according to little too 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.210
 funny moments with bartolomeo who 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.220
 that's how what makes the madman because 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.360
 that there is robin who fucked him one who has 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.650
 do a little wink here 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.730
 nicely while robin by the way 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.860
 quite conveniently huh it does 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.870
 steps with her feet there we are you 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.700
 feel crazy about hatching good liquidity 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.590
 I find that the fruit of the fruit of 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.000
 robin's demon offers us thousands 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.250
 of possibilities we do not have everything yet 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.690
 seen but in any case have tolomeo and 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.040
 the more time passes and the more I say to myself 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.960
 inevitably they have to get into 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.400
 typing and more anyway I 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.200
 learned I did not know well but I had 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.450
 forgot but I remembered that 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.790
 the oda base wanted to get into 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.250
 the crew a kind of loubards of two 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.480
 guys with piercings and all that 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.680
 could have been crossed the problem 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.940
 is that there was already a cyborg of 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.470
 planned in the thing so it had to be 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.850
 quiet this guy there but I imagine that 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.500
 this guy be saying that they had to 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.419
 to enter the crew will be no other 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.130
 that marc than the best just pretty sure 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.980
 that it will be the lie until Sunday on 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.690
 in addition that goes perfectly in the 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.220
 delirium of the crew he can I see 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.230
 perfectly in the team al I see him 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.580
 perfectly the besides who knows everything 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.440
 what did the agents team that will 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.060
 not lost in their exploits 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.980
 past I say everything is perfect for that 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.270
 this guy can come in and more time 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.050
 pass over I tell myself it's obligatory who 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.460
 go in but no I do not know what 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.240
 you think but do not forget 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.530
 to say it in the comments 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.490
 nothing on this mix between the week 

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.550
 next for the next chapter of 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.710
 one piece where we will see I hope to fight 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.910
 especially 9 full rate mingoua because 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.230
 it's kind of annoying I mean their 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.610
 fight started we see the others 

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.410
 agree the hike interesting because 

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.540
 than that of a little bit before with the guy 

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.400
 delbarre cd blah blah this one it goes it's 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.300
 cool it goes but I hope that will follow 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.300
 surely not be the same
