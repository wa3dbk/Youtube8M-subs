that goalkeeper did look very good the

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.900 
that goalkeeper did look very good the
only<00:04:33.440> problem<00:04:33.770> I've<00:04:33.830> got<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.250> goalkeepers<00:04:34.789> at

only problem I've got the goalkeepers at

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.570 
only problem I've got the goalkeepers at
the<00:04:35.000> moment<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.539> fact<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:37.550> know

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the moment is the fact that you know

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.430 
the moment is the fact that you know
that<00:04:37.880> they're<00:04:38.060> 14<00:04:38.509> years<00:04:38.780> old<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.229> obviously

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
that they're 14 years old and obviously
