00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.500
 of the sound that this sony xperia 102 brings 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 Well now I'm going to read you a bit 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.010
 The main features account 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.060

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.550
 in the description of the video I'm going to give you 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.920
 more details of this sony xperia that 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.530
 is now what we are going to do sorry 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.619
 is to see a bit the design of the device 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.479
 and then how does the interface work? 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.020
 user, I have the sony at my hands 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.289
 xperia z 2 a device that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.820
 it looks a lot like xperia z 1 in design 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.850
 The truth is that it is very, very 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.789
 similar we have what the buttons are 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.700
 of Android integrated into the screen and 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.460
 then at the top we have what 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.530
 which is the front camera and we have the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.390
 earphone area on the underside 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.149
 Well, we have a series of holes that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 I really could not say what they're going for 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.920
 serve surely integrate the microphone 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.799
 and then we have a hole to tie 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 in the hand on the right side 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.590
 we have the camera button 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.659
 photographs we have control of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.049
 volume lock button unlock 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.720
 of the screen and we have the slot 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.290
 hidden with a lid for the card 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 of memory 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.300
 on the left side what we will have 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.640
 will be access to the compartment of the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.520
 SIM card 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.170
 remember that this sony xperia z 2 not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.569
 allows us to access your battery that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.840
 is integrated into what is the area 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.040
 later we see the camera lens 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.709
 with lenses are inge and a type flash 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 led the finish this sony xperia makes 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.070
 given that the posterior area is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.560
 glass and the front zone or what 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.870
 which is the front is also from 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.590
 crystal in line with what we saw in 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.239
 the on the sony xperia z one on the side 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.890
 superior as not because we have a 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.140
 hole that will match the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.060
 main microphone and also a 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 hole that is the jack three and a half 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.160
 for headphones now what I'm going to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.580
 to do is to see a little what is the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.550
 user interface of this sony xperia 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.680
 z 2 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.870
 so let's now take a look at the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.570
 sony xperia user interface 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 states that surely is not going to 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.190
 surprise because it will be the same 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.280
 experience that in the sony xperia meta 1 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.950
 let's see 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.470
 this is the user interface we can 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.250
 see that there are different desks 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.260
 typical on android 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.390
 we can make this gesture to go 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.880
 adding the different widgets of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.700
 shortcuts to applications we have 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.700
 as not the multi-tasking menu from where 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.670
 we can go closing the apps we have 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.920
 Obviously what is a menu 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.200
 sliding where we can see the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.660
 incoming notifications in our 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.660
 device and we also have a part 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.220
 with quick adjustments to control then 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.190
 wireless connections is adjusted 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.190
 screen brightness and other menu 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.500
 applications well here we have it its 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.110
 application menu for quite 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.720
 standard in sony where we found 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.260
 what is a side menu from where 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.180
 we can organize a little the icons that 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.130
 we see and we can also uninstall 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.630
 some applications that we have 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.760
 downloaded from play the play store 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.730
 We can organize the icons as 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 we want we can move them at pleasure and 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.850
 we could even or should we be able 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.670
 create folders to group different 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.390
 applications of the same type 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.930
 in the system settings then we're going to 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.200
 see how they are nothing surprising are the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.450
 system settings listed with each 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.360
 section to be able to customize then 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.970
 sounds the wallpaper consult 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.210
 the storage and you can also 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.070
 adjust security measures what 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.010
 true is that in the user interface 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.380
 they are and it will not surprise us and it will be 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.640
 or will it be in line with what was seen in the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.590
 sony xperia z 1 this is a preview of 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.260
 this device and in the next 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.570
 weeks what I'm going to do is offer you 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.890
 the complete review of this magnificent 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:18.490
 sony xperia z 2 with 52 screen 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.490
