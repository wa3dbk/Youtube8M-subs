00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.939
 and who walks as they are, I am good people 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 in today's video I want to tell you that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 I'm super happy as usual 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.689
 because today I'm going to teach you some ideas 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.119
 to make lunch I feel that they are 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.899
 super easy fast and economical 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.489
 also healthy and good I hope that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 them much like this video you throw 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.719
 very much desire if they do not forget 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.149
 send me a picture in a tweet or 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.160
 instagram and give him little hand up if you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 like and keep watching if you want to know 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.250
 what ideas do I bring you in this video what 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.100
 you need is tomato mozzarella cheese 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.420
 cherry and sticks for banderillas 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.090
 now let's cut the cheese in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 squares the important thing is that it is not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560
 so small so you do not go to 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.380
 break in the banderillas 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.570
 but it does not have to be perfect since 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.390
 you have it in squares you are going to take the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.640
 first stick of your banderillas and you go to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.120
 start putting a tomato and cheese 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 a tomato and a cheese and so on until 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.080
 fill all the stick 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:26.759
 the truth is super super easy and ready 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.140
 now you're going to put everything in a paper I'll 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.590
 I put olive oil 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.170
 salt and pepper 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.759
 this is like a dressing for me but the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.500
 truth is that you can use the dressing 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.780
 what do you want 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.130
 This one I'm using is super dietary 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.920
 besides that the olive oil has 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 many good properties for the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.200
 end is what you like most time 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.660
 now if they are ready 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.830
 Now you need peanut butter bread 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.140
 wholemeal and marmalade can be of which 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 want the truth is that making a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.270
 sandwich is the easiest thing in the world but 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270
 good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 let's put peanut butter in one 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.480
 of the loaves 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.989
 and then you're going to put jam in the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.989
 other side 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.340
 now you close your sandwich and the short ones 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.500
 half 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.310
 I like to cut it on the side because it looks 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 much more beautiful 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.690
 you can put it in a tupper or where 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.790
 anytime I like this because 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.390
 then my sandwich arrives in perfect 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.390
 terms 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.569
 and ready 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.319
 for the smoothie you're going to need yogurt 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.090
 Greek strawberries milk and banana 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.159
 and we already know what to make a smoothie 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.489
 It's also the easiest way to put 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.650
 all the ingredients in a blender 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.269
 first you are going to put the solids and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.269
 then you will put the liquids 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.980
 and then since you have them all in the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.980
 blender we start to liquefy 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.920
 and now if we are going to put it in your thermos 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.080
 favorite or in the glass that you like 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.740
 that you can take to school this 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.740
 it is my favorite 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.500
 now you can put everything in your 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.180
 lunch box and ready for school you're 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.599
 slicing is my favorite because it's full 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.599
 of colors 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.170
 ah 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.170
 ah
