that problem too much the rate of fire
is<00:00:40.100> absolutely<00:00:41.100> insane<00:00:41.489> shooting<00:00:42.149> 1,000<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
is absolutely insane shooting 1,000 and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.549 
is absolutely insane shooting 1,000 and
150<00:00:43.890> rounds<00:00:44.309> per<00:00:44.520> minute<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.170> recoil

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
150 rounds per minute but the recoil

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
150 rounds per minute but the recoil
produced<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.640> stupid

look<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.260> nuts<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> thing<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.070> my

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
look how nuts this thing is my

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
look how nuts this thing is my
recommendation<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> use<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> gun

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
recommendation for when to use this gun

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
recommendation for when to use this gun
is<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.280> spamming<00:00:53.730> through<00:00:53.940> walls<00:00:54.120> because

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is for spamming through walls because

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.840 
is for spamming through walls because
spams<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.170> typically<00:00:55.530> less<00:00:55.860> precise<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
spams are typically less precise and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.029 
spams are typically less precise and
only<00:00:57.059> require<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> dish<00:00:58.859> out

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
only require that you know you dish out

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.819 
only require that you know you dish out
a<00:00:59.100> ton<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> bullets<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.510> utilizes<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
a ton of bullets which utilizes all of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.330 
a ton of bullets which utilizes all of
this<00:01:01.949> gun<00:01:02.160> strong<00:01:02.489> ports

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.999 

tapping<00:01:10.240> with<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.570> gun<00:01:10.750> actually<00:01:11.530> isn't<00:01:11.740> too

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
tapping with the gun actually isn't too

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.460 
tapping with the gun actually isn't too
bad<00:01:12.430> but<00:01:13.420> if<00:01:13.630> you're<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:14.049> using<00:01:14.380> a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
