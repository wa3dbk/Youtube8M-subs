00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.570
 friends we'll talk about going on your 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.010
 earth 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.139
 and more specifically 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.579
 where to begin 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.129
 what do you need to do she 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.239
 I suggest a step by step transition 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.050
 two days later the long rhythm we move on 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.769
 raw foods 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.729
 as well as our main task our main 

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:23.900
 task 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 bring all this system to do 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.489
 specific base 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.699
 not to rush from side to side what 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.160
 will come some kind of sharp washer 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.970
 but steps that can lead us to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.280
 like a return brother or other 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.030
 some 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.720
 body reaction 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.410
 but in general, friends, we will not spread 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.990
 sell take take 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.610
 with you notebook 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.250
 usually notebook work school 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.330
 there may be markers for highlighting 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 we will already make this transition 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.510
 so the first thing 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.390
 what will help us 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 I have this desire anyway 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980
 suddenly there is a desire 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.040
 m something to change in your life to 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.240
 to try 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.150
 in this case it is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.020
 transition on piles 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 I'm trying to change myself 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 for himself changes the world around him shorter 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 desire is the first engine this is what 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.120
 pushing us we start to find out what 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.110
 that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.040
 on the issue 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670
 process how to look for other people who 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.310
 we could tell 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 Revenge on the Internet to buy letters 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.180
 unfortunately desire cannot us 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.320
 soak constantly and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.110
 everything happens so 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 we have to feed ourselves as well 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560
 number logs based on 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 of ours can be crazy of our goals 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.360
 what we do we take sana 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.080
 our notebook about which we have already spoken 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.650
 unlockable and the first entry which google 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.190
 but do it our goals 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.130
 on arrival here on this lively food I am so 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.260
 did you see i took 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.360
 and recorded 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.289
 m and the marker 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.149
 I singled out in myself from the hand which 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.939
 I have to approach the price for example 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.699
 percent of the first and want to lose weight by 10 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.559
 kilogram 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.409
 and to the end of this life of your own have a slim 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.209
 a figure 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.590
 in just six months i have to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.749
 achieve this 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.359
 Well, in general, not approximately 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.109
 written 6 months 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.939
 And this business to autokey 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.029
 sad moments when suddenly we 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.839
 I want to quit 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.089
 barely a question arises why do I need it 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.449
 or when your day we will be put 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.339
 finally 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.089
 we came quietly by ourselves I offer it 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.079
 do not be alone with yourself 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.439
 show it to anyone 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.649
 under the bed with a notebook 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:52.999
 and read 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.699
 that 100 we needed what we wanted what I 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.799
 specifically wanted to write from the first 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.579
 faces i want 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.420
 I wish I will not hurt more than once 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.739
 In my life 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.479
 all in general 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.929
 you must be at the dacha house 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.929
 motivate yourself and start goals 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.809
 clear write from 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:17.339
 own
