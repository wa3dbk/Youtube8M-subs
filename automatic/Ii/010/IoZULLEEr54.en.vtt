00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 although today presenter is part of the great 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.500
 treasure of Cartagena this week is spoken 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.059
 Much of Cartagena's treasure I believe 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.849
 that Cartagena is not just a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 treasure is the sum of the treasure and in this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.949
 case what we come to present is the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.869
 treasure that does not look like a treasure that 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.490
 it's very rarely people have 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.029
 opportunity to see what the funds are 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
 sailors of our city the charm of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 those funds have made it possible for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 the year 2009 that are working 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.559
 both wide angle and the school of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 southern valqui diving to which I also 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.840
 I want to thank your work and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.230
 congratulate them for it because they have made 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.270
 we can show the world 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.630
 in the great treasure submerged in our 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.720
 city 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.700
 We decided to travel the world 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 locating the best diving spots 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.840
 and of tourism and of course since 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.500
 we have here our diving centers and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 we consider that 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.310
 the cape de palos cartagena is an area 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.280
 privileged throughout the world and is a 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.640
 reality how it will look in the series 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.340
 we make the chapter corporal of sticks and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.650
 Cartagena in which for 26 years 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.660
 minutes what we show is 7 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 dives and between each of the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.430
 seven investments aspects of the country 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.470
 in this case and the tourist area that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.690
 includes distribution by life 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.960
 what we have done has been to give it is 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.520
 put them at your service or equipment or 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 boats 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 and all the hours that they have needed us 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 so that in order to record all those 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 minutes that although they are 26 in the end the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.259
 that reproduce you know that they have 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 have been many more hours that have been 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.229
 had to dedicate there of the entire team 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.229
 recording
