00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.580
 Let me ask that question 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.540
 Design it while showing it now 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 Konan high 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.169
 It's not that you're in emergency 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.099
 After all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.979
 There is also a year 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.509
 Even if your subordinates are not good enough, they will catch nine 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.890
 It is adopted 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.739
 Speak that it was adopted 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.169
 Mask is available 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.909
 People of all ages participate 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.349
 For reporting and locking 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.920
 3 losses 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.640
 It is so from the beginning of the league for two consecutive years 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.860
 First of all, with users 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.710
 Support for getting a gap point between two countries 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.180
 Team Bonds at the time of sale 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.280
 It will be very different 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 I told you that I have been a part-time job 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.580
 I've been here and I'm still doing it I'm still studying 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.720
 It's a feeling of doing 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.960
 Even if it is Rockman at each house in the village 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.910
 Aside from being a character and shared property 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.690
 you know 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 Mr. Hori has been making Dragon Quest so much 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.720
 Because 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 Japanese creators will make as part of Capcom 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440
 Some of them are already 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.200
 People who were children came in this June 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.540
 Your own sixth place 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.100
 I like making my rock different 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530
 I think it's a situation 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.380
 I said that from now on 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.210
 Unplate this 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.160
 I am fighting Fukuoka 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.580
 It's not an aerobic action game 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.530
 Like 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 I think that what I testified will do various things 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.610
 do it 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 I went up to mound from 8 times 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.130
 I also have a character 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 I think that it will be the next one 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 In the continuation that keeps making it keep going 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 I have sales for this season 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 Is it only learning how to interact with the user? 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 This electrode 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 Let's study making a team 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 continuing 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.069
 Keep changing during the period 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.220
 I want to receive a desk 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.050
 Most important
