00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.550
 Hello 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:10.630
 Today I want to show you 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.870
 a stevia plant that 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.570
 jose and from which he harvests seed 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.490
 can see here 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.789
 there's the flower, I'm going to let it 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.330
 Dry a little more to then remove 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.500
 the good seed also had 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.820
 harvested me other plants and I proceeded to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.420
 sow the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.329
 different ways some I sowed 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.740
 in trays co 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.200
 as you see here and then 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:53.170
 already the veins and all germinated 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.170
 and then others I put them in some glasses 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.960
 to see 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.309
 and others I put in a 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.630
 in some trays 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.350
 here are other 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.250
 of good and others 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.250
 I want you to see 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.710
 this is a secret that I'm going to 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.050
 save 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.920
 after put in glasses but I did something 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.920
 and see the difference 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.149
 in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.509
 the growth all these plants 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.600
 are exactly the same age if 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.570
 perhaps 1 or 2 days apart but 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 see 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.860
 the one on the tray 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.430
 the one on the tray 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.790
 Y 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.930
 the one with my secret formula here 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 the difference 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.400
 we are going to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.470
 without moving the camera a little 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.470
 let's measure here 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.540
 the largest plant here has 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.540
 approximately 4 centimeters 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 the largest plant 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.280
 in the tray has 7 centimeters in 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.180
 this tray 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.180
 we'll see 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.880
 It also has 7 centimeters that is 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.890
 Cacerolita the bean 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:58.250
 nothing else that Nazism is not here 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:01.190
 since it did not have much light 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.830
 here are 9 centimeters 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.920
 and you are 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.930
 let's see here about also 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.300
 it's nine centimeters but with the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.950
 difference that you see the sheet here 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.950
 here already the sheet has 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.940
 so 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.210
 three and a half centimeters 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.060
 three and a half centimeters wide in the 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.950
 tray 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.530
 they have 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 about one and a half wide here in the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.310
 tray one and a half wide and here then 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.100
 I believe that the centimeter does not reach 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.510
 here if a centimeter wide 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.780
 then see 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.590
 so you can see the difference here I 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.599
 discovered a way to germinate 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.050
 seed as you can see from here 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:02.360
 transplant the plant to these vessels 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.140
 a way to germinate seed them 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.750
 is fall 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.640
 While 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.640
 they are the same age 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.900
 the substrate all the substrate has is the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.410
 same type of substrate and the same type 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.670
 of 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.310
 d 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:27.770
 of nutrient content except in 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.050
 the vessels that transplant them to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.190
 little bit 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.689
 because precisely because of the size 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.919
 good 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:42.229
 how can you see the differences at 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.049
 sow seeds in different 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.620
 containers 

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:51.060
 and this secret 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.060
 I keep it 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.930
 very good is everything
