00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.320 

mirrors<00:00:02.010> edge<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.399> connect<00:00:02.669> wouldnt<00:00:03.210> it<00:00:03.240> be

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
mirrors edge and connect wouldnt it be

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.510 
mirrors edge and connect wouldnt it be
cool<00:00:03.629> if<00:00:03.929> both<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.529> them<00:00:04.680> can<00:00:05.130> work<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.430> each

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
cool if both of them can work with each

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.670 
cool if both of them can work with each
other<00:00:05.730> well<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.540> thought<00:00:06.870> it'd<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.020> cool<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
other well I thought it'd be cool so I

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.100 
other well I thought it'd be cool so I
tried<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.010> make<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.370> happen<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.660> want<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
tried to make it happen so I want to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.600 
tried to make it happen so I want to
share<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> world<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.340> what<00:00:11.490> they

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
share that with the world see what they

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.940 
share that with the world see what they
think<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.540> definitely<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.960> perfect<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
think it's definitely not perfect this

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.129 
think it's definitely not perfect this
first<00:00:14.219> time<00:00:14.519> trial<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:15.389> makes<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> look

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
first time trial actually makes it look

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
first time trial actually makes it look
pretty<00:00:16.410> darn<00:00:17.070> good<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.240> then<00:00:18.330> I'll<00:00:18.420> show<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
pretty darn good but then I'll show you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.090 
pretty darn good but then I'll show you
another<00:00:18.779> one<00:00:19.050> where<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.590> totally<00:00:19.949> see

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
another one where you can totally see

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
another one where you can totally see
where<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> limitations<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.800> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
where some of the limitations are so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.540 
where some of the limitations are so
I'll<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.130> started

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I'll get this started

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.730 
I'll get this started
again<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.390> simply<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.109> run<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
again very simply you just run it in

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460 
again very simply you just run it in
place<00:00:26.090> in<00:00:27.090> order<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.449> change<00:00:27.750> direction<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
place in order to change direction you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.640 
place in order to change direction you
still<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.189> Xbox<00:00:29.789> 360<00:00:30.510> controller<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:31.140> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
still use the Xbox 360 controller in my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:50.420 
still use the Xbox 360 controller in my
right<00:00:32.250> hand<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.579> right<00:00:32.759> now

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.740 

sometimes<00:00:51.430> I'm<00:00:51.609> not<00:00:51.760> great<00:00:51.969> at<00:00:52.120> timing<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
sometimes I'm not great at timing the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
sometimes I'm not great at timing the
duck<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:54.489> make<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.789> land<00:00:54.969> smoother

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.830 

not<00:01:25.110> bad<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.890> 58<00:01:26.520> seconds<00:01:26.880> gets<00:01:27.480> me<00:01:27.660> one

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
not bad time 58 seconds gets me one

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.220 
not bad time 58 seconds gets me one
stock<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.300> simple<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.080> easy

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
stock that was the very simple and easy

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.200 
stock that was the very simple and easy
level<00:01:31.500> straightforward<00:01:32.220> running<00:01:32.850> jumping

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
level straightforward running jumping

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.200 
level straightforward running jumping
should<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.260> some<00:01:34.410> ducking<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> big

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
should be some ducking but not a big

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
should be some ducking but not a big
deal<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.600> didn't<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> show

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
deal that I didn't now I'm going to show

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
deal that I didn't now I'm going to show
the<00:01:39.510> first<00:01:39.720> playground<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.380> there's<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.250> lot

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the first playground one there's a lot

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.650 
the first playground one there's a lot
more<00:01:41.490> different<00:01:41.790> activities<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
more different activities for you and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.450 
more different activities for you and
will<00:01:42.960> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> show<00:01:43.230> some<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.220> potential

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
will kind of show some of the potential

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.890 
will kind of show some of the potential
limitations<00:01:45.120> for<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:47.660> began

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
limitations for it began

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.760 
limitations for it began
I'm<00:01:49.710> already<00:01:49.890> somewhat<00:01:50.160> out<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.370> breath<00:01:51.770> who

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I'm already somewhat out of breath who

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.750 
I'm already somewhat out of breath who
would<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:52.980> thought<00:01:53.100> running<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> place<00:01:53.610> would

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
would have thought running a place would

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:09.940 
would have thought running a place would
be<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.030> hard

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.010 

so<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.580> can<00:02:10.759> still<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> wall<00:02:11.510> jump<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
so you can still do the wall jump and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.220 
so you can still do the wall jump and
miss<00:02:12.890> time<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.400> jump<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:13.930> also<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.110> it

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
miss time to that jump but also have it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.150 
miss time to that jump but also have it
so<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.530> punch<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.099> door<00:02:16.250> open<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.860> then

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so you can punch the door open and then

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.000 
so you can punch the door open and then
the<00:02:19.280> balance<00:02:19.610> beam<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:21.140> put<00:02:21.290> your<00:02:21.380> arm<00:02:21.560> out

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the balance beam just put your arm out

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:33.339 
the balance beam just put your arm out
don't<00:02:23.000> say<00:02:23.239> yourself

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.110 

I'll<00:02:33.950> miss<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.310> jump<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.819> no<00:02:34.969> big

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
I'll miss that jump to have a no big

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.599 
I'll miss that jump to have a no big
deal<00:02:37.090> look<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.390> side<00:02:40.810> jump<00:02:42.250> yeah<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> little

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
deal look to the side jump yeah a little

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.550 
deal look to the side jump yeah a little
bit<00:02:43.700> slower<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:45.049> probably<00:02:45.260> go<00:02:45.439> with

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
bit slower and you can probably go with

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.869 
bit slower and you can probably go with
the<00:02:45.620> keyboard<00:02:46.099> but<00:02:46.310> not<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> big<00:02:47.420> deal

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.330 

try<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.000> hop<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.480> roof<00:02:53.750> again<00:02:54.500> these

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
try and hop up to the roof again these

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.990 
try and hop up to the roof again these
simple<00:02:56.230> motions<00:02:57.230> are<00:02:57.379> probably<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.670> toughest

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
simple motions are probably the toughest

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.089 
simple motions are probably the toughest
ones<00:02:59.349> because<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.470> don't<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.769> fine

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
ones because you don't have that fine

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.369 
ones because you don't have that fine
grain<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.489> control

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
grain of control

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.959 
grain of control
now<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.920> like<00:03:04.099> balancing<00:03:04.519> I<00:03:04.579> can<00:03:04.730> hold<00:03:04.879> the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
now just like balancing I can hold the

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.699 
now just like balancing I can hold the
left<00:03:05.209> which<00:03:05.599> would<00:03:05.720> make<00:03:05.870> me<00:03:05.900> shimmy<00:03:06.560> across

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
left which would make me shimmy across

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:20.550 
left which would make me shimmy across
the<00:03:07.189> wall<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.700> left<00:03:13.810> hop<00:03:14.810> up<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.230> wall

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.730 

now<00:03:21.130> again<00:03:21.870> supposed<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.990> be<00:03:23.110> some<00:03:23.350> fine

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
now again supposed to be some fine

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.230 
now again supposed to be some fine
movements<00:03:24.010> here<00:03:26.580> hold<00:03:27.580> my<00:03:27.640> left<00:03:27.880> arm<00:03:28.120> out

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
movements here hold my left arm out

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.870 
movements here hold my left arm out
slowly<00:03:29.200> shimmy<00:03:29.680> across<00:03:32.400> slowly<00:03:33.400> ever<00:03:33.850> so

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
slowly shimmy across slowly ever so

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.930 
slowly shimmy across slowly ever so
slowly<00:03:34.230> now<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.530> where<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.490> fine<00:03:36.730> get

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
slowly now this is where the fine get

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.940 
slowly now this is where the fine get
ingrained<00:03:37.300> control<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:38.319> really<00:03:38.590> needed<00:03:38.860> so

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
ingrained control it's really needed so

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.729 
ingrained control it's really needed so
I'm<00:03:39.040> actually<00:03:39.130> gonna<00:03:39.660> do<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.290> little

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
I'm actually gonna do this one a little

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.740 
I'm actually gonna do this one a little
bit<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:41.980> with<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.880> controller<00:03:45.060> there<00:03:46.060> we<00:03:46.239> go

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.960 

and<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.870> hopped<00:03:50.050> off<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.560> late<00:03:50.800> but<00:03:51.069> not<00:03:51.910> a

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and I hopped off a little late but not a

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.330 
and I hopped off a little late but not a
big<00:03:52.239> deal

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.550 

see<00:04:01.030> if<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.270> can<00:04:01.450> now<00:04:01.599> now<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:02.170> get<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> duck

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
see if I can now now can get the duck

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.770 
see if I can now now can get the duck
again<00:04:02.680> but<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.730> takes<00:04:03.880> practice

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.770 

and<00:04:10.990> how<00:04:11.710> I<00:04:11.740> hit<00:04:12.040> my<00:04:12.130> head<00:04:12.280> I'll<00:04:13.210> just<00:04:13.390> back<00:04:13.600> up

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
and how I hit my head I'll just back up

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.759 
and how I hit my head I'll just back up
with<00:04:13.960> control<00:04:14.890> Christie's<00:04:15.370> easier<00:04:16.500> hop<00:04:17.500> up

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
with control Christie's easier hop up

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.190 
with control Christie's easier hop up
and<00:04:19.650> we're<00:04:20.650> done<00:04:20.799> here<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.790> again<00:04:22.300> not

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
and we're done here so again not

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.690 
and we're done here so again not
terrible<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> believe<00:04:24.010> that's<00:04:24.190> actually<00:04:24.310> close

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
terrible I believe that's actually close

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.130 
terrible I believe that's actually close
to<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.840> one<00:04:25.990> star<00:04:26.350> but<00:04:27.720> still<00:04:28.720> pretty<00:04:28.870> neat

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
to the one star but still pretty neat

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.740 
to the one star but still pretty neat
still<00:04:29.680> makes<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.280> lot<00:04:30.520> more<00:04:30.970> fun<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.300> play<00:04:31.480> a

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
still makes a lot more fun to play a

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
still makes a lot more fun to play a
single<00:04:32.500> player<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.830> definitely<00:04:33.160> harder

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
single player is definitely harder

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.040 
single player is definitely harder
because<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.970> got<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> control<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.510> bit<00:04:34.690> more<00:04:34.840> but

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because you got a control a bit more but

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.920 
because you got a control a bit more but
would<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.710> pretty<00:04:35.950> sweet<00:04:36.190> if<00:04:36.310> dice<00:04:37.300> put<00:04:37.810> this

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
would be pretty sweet if dice put this

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.210 
would be pretty sweet if dice put this
into<00:04:38.140> Mirror's<00:04:38.440> Edge<00:04:38.560> 2<00:04:38.620> whenever<00:04:38.980> that

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
into Mirror's Edge 2 whenever that

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.850 
into Mirror's Edge 2 whenever that
happens<00:04:39.670> or<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.060> happens<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> still<00:04:41.830> a

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
happens or if that happens but still a

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.970 
happens or if that happens but still a
lot<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.040> fun<00:04:42.190> hope<00:04:42.430> people<00:04:42.580> like<00:04:42.790> it
