00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the first thing we're going to look at

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.039 
the first thing we're going to look at
here<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.920> sure<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.850> gas<00:01:12.210> line<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
here is make sure that the gas line is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.520 
here is make sure that the gas line is
off<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.720> position<00:01:15.750> when

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
off and it's in the off position when

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
off and it's in the off position when
it's<00:01:16.979> perpendicular<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.810> gas<00:01:18.990> line

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it's perpendicular to the gas line

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
it's perpendicular to the gas line
itself<00:01:19.770> once<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> same

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
itself once it's going the same

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.649 
itself once it's going the same
direction<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> gas<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.540> know

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
direction as the gas line then you know

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.770 
direction as the gas line then you know
it's<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> we're<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.240> ahead<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's on so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's on so we're going to go ahead and
turn<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.100> point<00:01:32.360> just<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
turn it on at this point just like so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.830 
turn it on at this point just like so
now<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
now you know it's on because it's in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.899 
now you know it's on because it's in
congruent<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.350> what's<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
congruent with what's going on with the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
congruent with what's going on with the
direction<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> pipe<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> flows<00:01:40.439> down

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
direction of the pipe as it flows down

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.429 
direction of the pipe as it flows down
this<00:01:40.890> way<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.299> now

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this way all right now

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.520 
this way all right now
the<00:01:44.159> next<00:01:44.430> thing<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> look<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the next thing we're going to look at is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
the next thing we're going to look at is
it's<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.979> position<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.780> doesn't

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it's in the off position so it doesn't

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's in the off position so it doesn't
turn<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:49.970> now<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:52.070> your<00:01:53.090> water

let's see if I can help it along a

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.470 
let's see if I can help it along a
little<00:02:46.840> bit<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.620> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
little bit there it is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.290 
little bit there it is
these<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.810> cantankerous<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:52.000> I'm<00:02:52.120> going

these can be cantankerous what I'm going
to<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.780> go<00:02:52.960> ahead<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.230> lift<00:02:53.410> it

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
to do is just go ahead and lift it

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.040 
to do is just go ahead and lift it
straight<00:02:53.710> up<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> way

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
straight up out of the way

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.500 
straight up out of the way
now<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.380> look<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.920> inside<00:02:57.100> here<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
now you look on the inside here the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330 
now you look on the inside here the
lighter<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.140> there<00:02:59.380> where<00:02:59.710> it's<00:02:59.890> kind<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
lighter is there where it's kind of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.940 
lighter is there where it's kind of
corroded<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.270> little<00:03:01.570> bit<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:02.590> where<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
corroded a little bit that's where the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
corroded a little bit that's where the
gas<00:03:03.160> line<00:03:03.520> will<00:03:03.760> let<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.330> that's<00:03:04.450> where

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
gas line will let out and that's where

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660 
gas line will let out and that's where
the<00:03:04.750> pilot<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.100> we're<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> light

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
the pilot is so we're going to light

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.850 
the pilot is so we're going to light
that<00:03:06.700> particular<00:03:07.420> point<00:03:07.600> I'm<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
that particular point I'm not going to

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.980 
that particular point I'm not going to
put<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.100> camera<00:03:09.370> or<00:03:09.820> my<00:03:09.970> face<00:03:10.210> up<00:03:10.450> next<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
put the camera or my face up next to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.690 
put the camera or my face up next to
this<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.530> will<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.920> last<00:03:12.160> time<00:03:12.430> that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700

you see this until it's lit now we come
to<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.500> point<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:17.830> where<00:03:18.070> we're<00:03:18.220> going<00:03:18.370> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
to the point for where we're going to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.570 
to the point for where we're going to

light this and what you do you simply
turn<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:23.050> pilot<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:24.820> point<00:03:25.150> here<00:03:26.700> push

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
turn the pilot to this point here push

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.940

too
the<00:05:33.510> white<00:05:33.870> mark<00:05:34.170> which<00:05:34.410> is<00:05:34.440> not<00:05:35.010> too<00:05:35.610> cold<00:05:35.880> not

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
the white mark which is not too cold not

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.360 
the white mark which is not too cold not
too<00:05:36.330> hot<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.590> have<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.950> little<00:05:38.190> bit

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
too hot I like to have it a little bit

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.920 
too hot I like to have it a little bit
harder<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.900> way<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.080> use<00:05:40.320> less<00:05:40.680> water<00:05:41.930> what's

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
harder that way I use less water what's

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.420 
harder that way I use less water what's
up

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
up

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.220 
up
so<00:05:44.430> again<00:05:44.790> repeating<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:46.410> steps<00:05:46.820> first<00:05:48.230> make

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
so again repeating the steps first make

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.220 
so again repeating the steps first make
sure<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:50.100> read<00:05:50.370> everything<00:05:50.880> all<00:05:51.510> the

direction that you fully understand what
you're<00:05:54.120> doing<00:05:54.390> because<00:05:54.540> this<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:54.900> very

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
you're doing because this is a very

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.700 
you're doing because this is a very
dangerous<00:05:55.440> procedure<00:05:57.050> make<00:05:58.050> sure<00:05:58.230> that<00:05:58.440> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
dangerous procedure make sure that the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.070 
dangerous procedure make sure that the
gas<00:05:59.190> line<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.820> turned<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.300> it's<00:06:00.840> in<00:06:01.230> line<00:06:03.080> if

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
gas line is turned on it's in line if

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.890 
gas line is turned on it's in line if
it's<00:06:04.350> off<00:06:04.530> it's<00:06:04.830> turned<00:06:05.280> perpendicular<00:06:06.270> but

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
it's off it's turned perpendicular but

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.390 
it's off it's turned perpendicular but
we've<00:06:07.050> got<00:06:07.260> it<00:06:07.380> going<00:06:07.710> in<00:06:08.190> line<00:06:09.890> that<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:11.100> turn

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
we've got it going in line that you turn

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.180 
we've got it going in line that you turn
this<00:06:12.360> part<00:06:12.780> particularly<00:06:13.320> off<00:06:13.620> to<00:06:14.010> the

you're holding this down for about a
minute<00:06:42.900> or<00:06:42.990> so<00:06:43.260> and<00:06:43.500> what<00:06:44.250> you<00:06:44.370> do<00:06:44.520> why<00:06:44.640> you<00:06:44.670> do

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
that is you you let the gas clear make

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.040 
that is you you let the gas clear make
