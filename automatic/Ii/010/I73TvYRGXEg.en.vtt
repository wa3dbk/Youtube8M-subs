which<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.570> another<00:00:25.050> armor<00:00:25.560> ability<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
which is another armor ability that is

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.870 
which is another armor ability that is
centered<00:00:27.240> around<00:00:27.359> mobility<00:00:28.400> now<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.730> guys

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
centered around mobility now if you guys

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
centered around mobility now if you guys
remember<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.960> previous<00:00:31.380> video<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.949> did<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
remember my previous video I did it on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
remember my previous video I did it on
the<00:00:32.579> jetpack<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.989> plan<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.230> doing<00:00:34.559> more

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the jetpack I do plan on doing more

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
the jetpack I do plan on doing more
videos<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> jetpack<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> go

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
videos on the jetpack but I want to go

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
videos on the jetpack but I want to go
through<00:00:37.140> each<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.010> armor<00:00:38.340> abilities

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
through each of the armor abilities

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
through each of the armor abilities
piece<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:39.600> piece<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:41.670> video<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.059> to

be covering some general tips and some
general<00:00:45.000> tactics<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.719> guys<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.140> use

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
general tactics that you guys can use

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
general tactics that you guys can use
with<00:00:47.340> thruster<00:00:47.879> pack<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.329> let's<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.629> right

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
with thruster pack so let's get right

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
with thruster pack so let's get right
into<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> thruster<00:00:50.010> pack<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> an

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
into it now the thruster pack is an

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
into it now the thruster pack is an
armor<00:00:50.820> ability<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.449> literally<00:00:52.140> thrust<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
armor ability that literally thrust you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
armor ability that literally thrust you
in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> direction<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.940> holding

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
in the direction that you're holding

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080 
in the direction that you're holding
with<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> left<00:00:54.989> analog<00:00:55.199> stick<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:56.039> find<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
with the left analog stick I find it to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.049 
with the left analog stick I find it to
be<00:00:57.180> more<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.750> defensive<00:00:58.219> ability<00:00:59.219> versus

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
be more of a defensive ability versus

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
be more of a defensive ability versus
you<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.480> maybe<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> jet<00:01:01.140> pack<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you know maybe the jet pack that I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
you know maybe the jet pack that I
considered<00:01:02.160> also<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> mobility

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
considered also be in the mobility

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.350 
considered also be in the mobility
category<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.500> found<00:01:04.949> myself<00:01:05.159> typically<00:01:06.000> using

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
category I found myself typically using

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
category I found myself typically using
the<00:01:06.450> thruster<00:01:06.780> pack<00:01:06.960> more<00:01:07.680> than<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> defensive

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the thruster pack more than a defensive

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.050 
the thruster pack more than a defensive
manner<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.360> Escape<00:01:09.720> grenades<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.500> or

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
manner to you know Escape grenades a or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.780 
manner to you know Escape grenades a or
you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.510> behind<00:01:12.689> cover<00:01:13.110> quickly<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you know get behind cover quickly so I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
you know get behind cover quickly so I
don't<00:01:15.210> end<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.540> dying<00:01:15.810> after<00:01:16.320> being<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> shot

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
don't end up dying after being one shot

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.230 
don't end up dying after being one shot
so<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> clips<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.790> we're<00:01:17.939> looking<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.210> right

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so the clips that we're looking at right

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
so the clips that we're looking at right
now<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.900> defensive<00:01:20.119> basically

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
now are all defensive basically

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.660 
now are all defensive basically
maneuvering<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.290> thruster<00:01:22.650> pack<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.159> see

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
maneuvering with the thruster pack I see

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.550 
maneuvering with the thruster pack I see
I'm<00:01:23.759> getting<00:01:24.000> shot<00:01:24.299> across<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> map<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I'm getting shot across the map and I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'm getting shot across the map and I
think<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.189> red<00:01:26.600> backhauls<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> drift<00:01:29.220> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
think that's red backhauls on a drift so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
think that's red backhauls on a drift so
I<00:01:29.850> jumped<00:01:30.299> towards<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> ceiling<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.829> he<00:01:31.950> can't

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I jumped towards the ceiling so he can't

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
I jumped towards the ceiling so he can't
see<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.640> head<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.119> thrust<00:01:33.479> backwards

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
see my head and then I thrust backwards

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.499 
see my head and then I thrust backwards
to<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:34.979> added<00:01:35.310> speed<00:01:35.579> here's<00:01:36.270> another

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to get some added speed here's another

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
to get some added speed here's another
clip<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> same

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
clip I think this is actually the same

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
clip I think this is actually the same
match<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> drift<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> guy<00:01:41.820> crouch

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
match on a drift have a guy crouch

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
match on a drift have a guy crouch
walking<00:01:42.780> towards<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> melees<00:01:43.710> me

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
walking towards me that melees me

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370 
walking towards me that melees me
surprised<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.790> after<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> double

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
surprised me after I get that double

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.450 
surprised me after I get that double
kill<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:48.119> off<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.100> thrust<00:01:50.100> around

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
kill and so I back off and thrust around

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
kill and so I back off and thrust around
the<00:01:50.549> corner<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.420> reloading

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the corner so you guys see I'm reloading

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.670 
the corner so you guys see I'm reloading
comes<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.829> smacks<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> can't

comes up smacks me and I know I can't

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
comes up smacks me and I know I can't
really<00:01:55.890> finish<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really finish that because there's a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
really finish that because there's a
second<00:01:57.090> guy<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> thrust<00:01:57.990> away

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
second guy so I'm going to thrust away

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.950

fighting two offensive texts i like to
use<00:02:30.960> with<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> thruster<00:02:31.920> pack<00:02:32.100> our<00:02:32.370> thrust

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
use with the thruster pack our thrust

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
use with the thruster pack our thrust
grenades<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.330> thrust<00:02:33.660> melees<00:02:34.050> now<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
grenades and thrust melees now the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.230 
grenades and thrust melees now the
reason<00:02:35.100> i<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.640> use<00:02:35.670> grenades<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
reason i like to use grenades I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.360 
reason i like to use grenades I
typically<00:02:36.600> use<00:02:36.690> plasma<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
typically use plasma is that the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730 
typically use plasma is that the
grenades<00:02:38.730> kind<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> counteract<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.410> being

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
grenades kind of counteract not being

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.410 
grenades kind of counteract not being
able<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.160> shoot<00:02:41.490> while<00:02:41.790> you're<00:02:41.970> thrusting

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
able to shoot while you're thrusting

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.880 
able to shoot while you're thrusting
because<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.080> throws<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.710> third

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
because it throws you in the third

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
because it throws you in the third
person<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.970> makes<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.240> opponent<00:02:45.720> have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
person and it makes your opponent have

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.140 
person and it makes your opponent have
to<00:02:46.080> react<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:47.040> those<00:02:47.190> grenades<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> might

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to react to those grenades so it might

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.910 
to react to those grenades so it might
throw<00:02:48.450> them<00:02:48.630> off<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.410> you're<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.710> heated

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
throw them off if you're in a heated

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800 
throw them off if you're in a heated
battle<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.490> have<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> grenade<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.510> manage

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
battle and you have a grenade you manage

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.560 
battle and you have a grenade you manage
to<00:02:51.930> throw<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.920> make<00:02:53.700> your<00:02:53.850> opponent<00:02:54.120> miss

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
to throw one and make your opponent miss

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
to throw one and make your opponent miss
or<00:02:54.810> skit<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> stick<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.800> did<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.190> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
or skit a stick like I did there to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
or skit a stick like I did there to
perform<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.209> really<00:02:57.360> easy<00:02:57.660> all<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.020> have

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
perform it it's really easy all you have

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.440 
perform it it's really easy all you have
to<00:02:58.380> do<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.740> just<00:02:59.220> throw<00:02:59.850> your<00:02:59.970> grenade<00:03:00.240> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to do is just throw your grenade and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.890 
to do is just throw your grenade and
then<00:03:00.600> immediately<00:03:01.100> after<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:03.150> your<00:03:03.330> thruster

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
then immediately after do your thruster

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
then immediately after do your thruster
ability<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.400> looks<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.760> happening

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
ability and it looks like it's happening

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.270 
ability and it looks like it's happening
simultaneously<00:03:06.620> now<00:03:07.620> thrust<00:03:07.920> melee

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
simultaneously now thrust melee

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.460 
simultaneously now thrust melee
essentially<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.330> same<00:03:09.540> thing<00:03:09.870> you're

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
essentially is the same thing you're

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.650

to<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.080> think<00:03:31.260> about<00:03:31.410> what<00:03:31.560> thruster<00:03:32.160> pack

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
to really think about what thruster pack

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.170 
to really think about what thruster pack
is<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.690> notion<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.230> misdirection<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.280> how<00:03:36.000> it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is the notion of misdirection and how it

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.720 
is the notion of misdirection and how it
can<00:03:36.300> be<00:03:36.420> used<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.989> tandem<00:03:37.380> with<00:03:37.769> either<00:03:38.310> launch

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
can be used in tandem with either launch

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.509 
can be used in tandem with either launch
pads<00:03:39.060> or<00:03:39.480> gravity<00:03:40.140> lifts<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.370> then

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
pads or gravity lifts and then

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.210 
pads or gravity lifts and then
misdirecting<00:03:42.269> your<00:03:42.450> jump<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.709> fool<00:03:44.070> your

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
