00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.930 

notice<00:00:13.580> that<00:00:13.820> it's<00:00:14.030> at<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.360> same<00:00:14.720> speed<00:00:15.440> as<00:00:15.860> it

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
notice that it's at the same speed as it

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.210 
notice that it's at the same speed as it
started<00:00:16.940> out<00:00:17.060> at<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.420> moma<00:00:17.840> brawl<00:00:18.110> and<00:00:18.410> also

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
started out at the moma brawl and also

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.940 
started out at the moma brawl and also
notice<00:00:19.670> that<00:00:19.700> when<00:00:20.510> I<00:00:20.540> jump<00:00:20.960> in<00:00:21.170> there<00:00:21.410> it

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
notice that when I jump in there it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.770 
notice that when I jump in there it
reaches<00:00:22.369> 999<00:00:23.360> damage<00:00:23.869> within<00:00:24.080> a<00:00:24.500> second

and<00:00:28.320> now<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.890> pop<00:00:29.160> fox<00:00:29.550> might<00:00:29.850> be

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and now I think pop fox might be

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.800 
and now I think pop fox might be
permanently<00:00:30.510> stuck<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.200> Oh<00:00:32.690> get<00:00:33.690> him

threw a party ball on top of its head
and<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.630> stopped<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.800> now<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.460> making<00:01:12.880> this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
and it stopped and now it's making this

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
and it stopped and now it's making this
extremely<00:01:13.690> fast<00:01:14.790> black<00:01:15.790> hole<00:01:16.150> that's<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:17.050> huge

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
extremely fast black hole that's so huge

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520 
extremely fast black hole that's so huge
it's<00:01:18.850> making<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.360> it's<00:01:19.509> making<00:01:19.750> my<00:01:19.990> gameplay

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
it's making that it's making my gameplay

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.219 
it's making that it's making my gameplay
go<00:01:20.740> faster<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.119> literally<00:01:22.479> think<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.990> just

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
go faster so I literally think I just

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.010 
go faster so I literally think I just
blew<00:01:23.530> up<00:01:23.560> my<00:01:23.770> game<00:01:23.830> cube<00:01:24.369> because<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.690> is

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
blew up my game cube because it is

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.930 
blew up my game cube because it is
making<00:01:26.530> some<00:01:26.740> really<00:01:26.920> funny<00:01:27.250> noises<00:01:27.550> right

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
making some really funny noises right

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.670 
making some really funny noises right
now<00:01:29.160> other<00:01:30.160> than<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:31.050> don't<00:01:32.050> know<00:01:32.530> what
