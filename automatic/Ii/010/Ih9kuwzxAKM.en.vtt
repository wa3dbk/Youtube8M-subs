00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to be jailbroken obviously that should

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
to be jailbroken obviously that should
go<00:01:29.700> without<00:01:29.790> saying<00:01:29.970> before<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.020> but

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to you know of course we jailbreak it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.209 
to you know of course we jailbreak it
and<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> stuff<00:01:55.409> however<00:01:55.950> you

and all that kind of stuff however you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.350 
and all that kind of stuff however you
get<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> let's<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> minute<00:01:57.210> with

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
get to let's see here in a minute with

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
get to let's see here in a minute with
Simeon<00:01:57.840> tether<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> longer<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
Simeon tether that is not a longer the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
Simeon tether that is not a longer the
case<00:01:59.340> once<00:02:00.060> your<00:02:00.180> device<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.570> rebooted<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
case once your device is rebooted you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
case once your device is rebooted you
should<00:02:01.439> find<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:01.979> works<00:02:02.159> basically<00:02:02.399> just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
should find that it works basically just

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
should find that it works basically just
fine<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.570> only<00:02:03.750> things<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.170> not<00:02:04.320> work

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
fine the only things that will not work

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920 
fine the only things that will not work
or<00:02:04.710> basically<00:02:05.280> Cydia<00:02:05.729> based<00:02:06.030> applications<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
or basically Cydia based applications so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
or basically Cydia based applications so
we<00:02:07.290> try<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.469> open<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.799> cydia<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.610> any<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we try to open up cydia or any kind of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430 
we try to open up cydia or any kind of
jailbreak<00:02:09.300> tweaks<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.200> work

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
jailbreak tweaks they will just not work

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.869 
jailbreak tweaks they will just not work
on<00:02:10.679> top<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.610> open<00:02:11.730> up

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
on top of that if we open up

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.320 
on top of that if we open up
Notification<00:02:12.569> Center

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
then once you do Buddha's tether just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.900 
then once you do Buddha's tether just
like<00:02:26.620> normal<00:02:26.800> you'll<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.370> able<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.580> use<00:02:27.730> all

the jailbreak tweaks you like I also do

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.870

with this and a couple of the apps such

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.000 
with this and a couple of the apps such
as<00:02:34.360> safari<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.230> mail<00:02:35.380> will<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.830> working

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.370 
as safari and mail will not be working
however<00:02:36.580> overall<00:02:37.000> at<00:02:37.480> least<00:02:37.720> having<00:02:37.990> most

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
however overall at least having most

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.050 
however overall at least having most
functionality<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.490> better<00:02:39.730> than<00:02:39.880> just

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
functionality there is better than just

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.340 
functionality there is better than just
having<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.360> dead<00:02:40.540> device<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.140> need<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
having a dead device that you need to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.440 
having a dead device that you need to
plug<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.770> at<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> end<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.280> day<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.060> there

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
plug in at the end of the day so there
