00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
easy I ran this for line wire and sewing

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.000 
easy I ran this for line wire and sewing
with<00:01:16.659> c3<00:01:17.110> because<00:01:17.320> I've<00:01:17.409> already<00:01:17.530> hooked<00:01:17.799> one

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
with c3 because I've already hooked one

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.160 
with c3 because I've already hooked one
to<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.310> taillights<00:01:18.790> all<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.869> way<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.020> the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
to the taillights all the way to the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.419

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
back of the car there I'm going to

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.969 
back of the car there I'm going to
separate<00:01:24.429> out<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.880> brown<00:01:25.090> wire<00:01:25.649> run<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:26.799> down

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
separate out the brown wire run it down

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.319 
separate out the brown wire run it down
through<00:01:27.219> there<00:01:27.429> put<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.789> through<00:01:27.939> that<00:01:28.090> pipe

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
through there put it through that pipe

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.510 
through there put it through that pipe
put<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.689> clip<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.200> end<00:01:29.350> clip<00:01:29.829> that<00:01:30.070> on<00:01:30.280> to

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
put a clip on the end clip that on to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.899 
put a clip on the end clip that on to
that<00:01:30.700> brake<00:01:30.969> light<00:01:31.179> sending<00:01:31.630> unit<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:33.549> two

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
that brake light sending unit these two

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.940 
that brake light sending unit these two
one<00:01:34.570> will<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.929> for<00:01:35.140> each<00:01:35.200> side<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.740> turn

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
one will be for each side of the turn

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.719 
one will be for each side of the turn
signal<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.869> this<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:38.499> pretty<00:01:38.649> simple<00:01:38.890> stuff

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
signal so this is pretty simple stuff

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.429 
signal so this is pretty simple stuff
I'll<00:01:40.149> come<00:01:40.450> off<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.719> other<00:01:40.899> side<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.350> that

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
I'll come off the other side of that

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.310 
I'll come off the other side of that
sending<00:01:41.799> unit<00:01:42.070> we<00:01:42.909> run<00:01:43.060> one<00:01:43.329> back<00:01:43.600> up<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.170> that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
sending unit we run one back up to that

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.529 
sending unit we run one back up to that
fuse<00:01:44.920> block<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.670> put<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:45.999> the<00:01:46.090> other<00:01:46.240> day

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
fuse block that I put in the other day

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.440 
fuse block that I put in the other day

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
that will supply the hot wire down to

00:01:49.450 --> 00:03:37.570 
that will supply the hot wire down to
that<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.979> should<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.490> us<00:01:51.549> brick<00:01:52.179> why
