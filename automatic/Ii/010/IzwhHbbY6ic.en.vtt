 because they are already very strong then 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.619
 It would be good to eat more cauliflower in those 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.869

 these free radicals that reach 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.760
 our body to invade onion 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.050
 these serve for all diseases 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.960
 then it is important to take the onion 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.700
 Now if you do not like the taste of 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.680
 this white onion can use the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.960
 dwelling that is a little less strong 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.720
 but they have the same properties 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.960
 this charlotte max this pussy could 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.740
 use the xaloc but it would give a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.990
 garlic touch 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.870
 If you do not like garlic, better 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.570
 purple onion but it could be a 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.080
 very interesting flavor with stir we are going to 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.710
 add our parsley 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.570
 that also helps a lot, they have never been 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.090
 said that there is nadal in the stomach it took 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.860
 before of parsley then before 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.370
 parsley out rich the truth is better 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.470
 know it like that because it's tastier 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.210
 let's put the olives that also 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.010
 can you choose to put the 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.830
 black or green olives I chose 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.069
 green by the colors nothing higher 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.590
 grapevines 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.260
 very famous in Spanish in Spain and 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:34.000
 I will also put avocado 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.730
 cut into cubes 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 and now we are going to incorporate good 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.600
 first let's pepper it so that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.230
 when we pour the lemon , distribute it well 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.260
 the salt between our food 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.260
 and now we are going to put the lemon 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.030
 let's put the oregano that the oregano 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.610
 it also helps a lot to the affections to 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.470
 If your belly hurts, eat this salad 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.090
 because it's going to serve you a lot apart from 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.950
 that the cauliflower is casually called 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.400
 cauliflower because it helps to remove the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.400
 colitis cauliflower colitis to dried 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 ah 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.829
 oregano and the princess laughs the prey 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.109
 and we are going to mix all the ingredients 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.960
 ah 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.199
 and this is the beginning of our sheet and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.870
 how rich is that natural bichito 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:33.319
 good and I want to reiterate that this week 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.479
 we are doing recipes 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:38.750
 vegetarian and I'll tell you why 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.240
 for two reasons one is because then to the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.300
 vegetarian people celecia of the world and the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.460
 another is because these recipes can 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.250
 even if you are not a vegetarian, you can 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.629
 incorporate into your daily diet and what 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.020
 only thing that you will do is that you will have 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:56.599
 much more now yes that scope of 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.240
 vitamins of minerals and proteins 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.669
 because if the proteins are in the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.960
 vegetables also have proteins though 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.879
 the school told us that nothing else 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.909
 the meat does not also the vegetables have 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.009
 many proteins and can incorporate it into 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.479
 your daily diet and children this this 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.580
 kind of foods they like a lot about 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.090
 all for the lemon and there is here who 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.090
 does not like 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.860
 nobody knows me today 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.240
 and nobody liked it right now and now 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.249
 here we are going to ride on our toast 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.609
 let's put our cebiche 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:36.609
 but before we go to a cut and we go back 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.530
 remember that cauliflowers are 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.750
 are at their best among the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.120
 months of September and January although 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.560
 we can dispose of them during all 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.100
 year 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.100
 and
