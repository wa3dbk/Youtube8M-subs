00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.520
 Welcome to this fashion and health I am 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.490
 Dr. Mendoza and today we are going to 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.459
 learn how to make one of my favorites 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.740
 masks for the face this helps no 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.630
 only so that you have more skin 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.169
 bright but also helps against 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.109
 granites that sometimes do not know if 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.060
 we are with decisional stress or 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.220
 also by bacteria that you enter from 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.619
 our skin for natural good that 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.690
 you can use the things in your house and it's 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.420
 one of my favorites that helps a lot 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.700
 with my skin it is true that your skin is basal 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.160
 so healthy so beautiful and it will shine 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.250
 and that is one that I like to like because 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.350
 It is very natural and helps for acne and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.660
 against real acne but you're going to 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.360
 have like a little glass like that to throw 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.900
 all ingredients ingredients 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.490
 that I have is the apple cider that 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.520
 they talked before apple cider 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.220
 It has so many very good buildings but 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.280
 it's either civic or you have to have 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 Be careful not to get on your skin 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.820
 directly because you really 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 you can always burn from a place with 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.590
 water is very important in the mask 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.920
 what I'm going to do, let's just like it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.990
 a little bit of this is the first 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.500
 ingredient the second ingredient is the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.600
 honey 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.690
 any honey you can use this the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.570
 buy house 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.060
 and also half a lemon this is going to help 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.820
 against bacteria kill all 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 bacteria even if your skin is also more 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.800
 white and lighter this is going to help you 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 clear up the clear face after this 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.050
 try not to be in the sun at all 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.700
 true to say you're going to be ready better 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.090
 action at night so that you rest 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.910
 skin in the morning put on a boxer for 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.980
 that the sun's rays vote because if not 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.830
 they will stain the face of the sun more or 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.010
 you can find it in any 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.530
 supermarket and it's very good to take out 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.240
 all those granites that you have ok that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.960
 first, your cup, you are going to take the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.960
 baking now 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.550
 let's put it like that just 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.010
 little bit ok like a spoon 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 ok so look it's going to know how it's going to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.090
 leave the turkeys again you are going to put 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.090
 the lemon 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.819
 and honey is very good because it is before 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.079
 bacteria 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.079
 you are going to mix it 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.130
 it's very watery you want it to be thick 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.930
 to put yourself in the face this is enough 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.980
 add more of the viking about until 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.980
 be thicker 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.340
 here is the mask and even a little 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.430
 thicker you get your face well and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.500
 dry it well and then put on the mask 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
 and leave it for about 5 or 10 minutes and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.200
