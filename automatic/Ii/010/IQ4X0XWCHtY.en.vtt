00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 all my friends here I greet you once 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.130
 more to teach them in this video where 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 is that the sensor snacks are 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.590
 he was marking the code that had to be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 change it so 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.410
 oh what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.080
 but start you have to remove everything that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.840
 hinders truth from the top and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.140
 remove the fan and that all the parties 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.079
 as they call it a spider but in this is the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.769
 and I have it already I already changed them 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.059
 it's so simple it's true to remove 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.059
 they usually have a nut 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.159
 around about $ 40 or so 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.670
 so pay and then here is look 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.159
 are they are twice to call it brand one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 the bank one and the bank are the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.089
 sensors only those that go here 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.520
 inside with these others I remove only 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.720
 you have to remove this nut that is here 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.000
 and they come out easily not only 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.150
 massimino there stuck and then to double 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.630
 located to the back and that's how it is 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.810
 simple to take off once we 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.530
 have changed because you just have to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.300
 put back I recommend that you keep 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 very well the screws really the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.840
 nuts separating them 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.970
 in each place out there in little boats for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.350
 that later you do not miss it you see that 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 it always happens that times are lost 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.049
 the screws true if possible 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.909
 mark them so they do not forget them in 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 what part of there are many people who 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.740
 they leave them there for the same 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.570
 wrong and good friends I hope that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.610
 this video has helped 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.130
 it's because I do not record all the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.500
 procedure but then 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.550
 it's not that hard truth there's only 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.160
 to remove everything 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.290
 and put it back as it was after 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.830
 that he has changed the sensors and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.490
 We hope that after 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.770
 also these sensors as this turn off 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.940
 the light stops marking that code since 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.310
 he was doing some flaws out there 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.500
 and we hope that it is already composed with this 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 change the elevators good friends 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 I hope this video has gone and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.810
 until next time
