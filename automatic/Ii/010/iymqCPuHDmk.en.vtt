00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.460
 hello my name is alexey on 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.280
 last lesson we looked at how you can 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.030
 insert transition in the program sony vegas 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.530
 pro 12 between photos 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.950
 let's consider another case instead 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.560
 transitions can do for example 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.990
 so I took the mouse and pressed the left key 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.370
 I put the photograph on the other as if 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.350
 impose creates us so smooth 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.490
 transition between two photos 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.490
 here you see yes 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.010
 so watch the amount I roll a little bit 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.010
 I did make it wide inside closed 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:00.060
 So such a transition type of attenuation can be 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.510
 modify here hover here 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.470
 written before tsiferki 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.420
 right click click summing 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.640
 the attenuation type we have on the left side 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.710
 Such a window is displayed where we can 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.950
 you can also select these types of attenuation 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 choose here if you move the cursor here 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.100
 here it is written 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 language of manifestation yes and at this moment 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 right-click the same 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.009
 Our case window appears 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.289
 This type of attenuation is activated. 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.800
 which is white. accordingly we can 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.380
 change for any let's say this one 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.490
 kind of attenuation that's when you see yes he 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.040
 so slightly modified we can 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.850
 such to deliver 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.850
 we'll see 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.780
 so after all attenuation we looked let's 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920
 we betray the movement 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.820
 photos are not only movement is not 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.910
 like last time on us 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:14.459
 the forest ran in our direction yes and now 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.459
 we will do the opposite left he lost 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.740
 let's open the window 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.220
 video event effects and make 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.220
 that's what 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.519
 mouse and we narrow 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.530
 after that take the cursor and take it to 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.530
 right side 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:45.129
 again take the mouse hold down the mouse button and 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.950
 on yourself back while on a try 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.670
 so that the photos do not go abroad 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.269
 this frame 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.269
 glees 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.280
 so let's see what we have 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.280
 happened 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.260
 everything is great 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 agree 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.409
 sony vegas transitions a lot and for 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.379
 one hand everything just doesn't show well 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:27.260
 let's get some of them here one more 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:27.709
 show here, too, we can put differently 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.430
 different 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.430
 edit 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.580
 so let us agree now 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.580
 arrange this movement pictures 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.980
 so cursor right 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.110
 clamping the mouse let's say we take it here in 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.110
 this side 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.340
 save give 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.270
 so let's see 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.110
 even a little like this stretch 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.110
 what we have 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.550
 so here 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.640
 just from can be seen like ours 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.980
 it became the movement of the photo on 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.850
 the future is very useful now 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.900
 will show 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.290
 here on the movement was yes and stopped 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.340
 go special effects leads events and 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.400
 see what we have. 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.920
 or rather the keyframe he moved gives 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.240
 and was in this place we move it 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.240
 back and everything look 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.790
 that is, we are going to the very 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.790
 the end 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.940
 yes nuances of course a bit too much what to do 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.050
 nature of the program 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:15.420
 invest us professionally for what her 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 thank you so much well on this lesson 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.550
