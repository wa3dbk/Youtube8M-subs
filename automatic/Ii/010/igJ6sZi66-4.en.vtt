know this is a demo so to speed up my
demo<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.750> ahead<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.020> choose<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
demo I'm going to go ahead and choose a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.680 
demo I'm going to go ahead and choose a
smaller<00:01:01.829> size<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
smaller size here now you don't have to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
smaller size here now you don't have to
do<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> step<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.739> again<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.369> demo

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

familiar<00:03:45.840> with<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.590> detail<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.549> is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060

detail and yeah I think we have

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.390 
detail and yeah I think we have
sharpness<00:03:52.260> where<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.590> need<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:53.099> have<00:03:53.220> some

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
sharpness where we need it we have some

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.729 
sharpness where we need it we have some
good<00:03:53.579> detail<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.599> gives<00:03:54.959> us<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.200> feel<00:03:55.500> for

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
good detail this gives us a feel for

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.080

some<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> things<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:56.609> might<00:03:56.819> want<00:03:56.879> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
some of the things that we might want to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.170 
some of the things that we might want to
do<00:03:57.329> when<00:03:57.599> retouching<00:03:58.260> then<00:03:58.919> we<00:03:59.579> start<00:03:59.849> to<00:03:59.970> zoom

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
out when we zoom out we'll see more

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.059

it's<00:04:53.040> going<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.430> some<00:04:53.669> little<00:04:53.880> teeny

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it's going to be some little teeny

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.600 
it's going to be some little teeny
adjustments<00:04:55.080> here<00:04:55.320> I'll<00:04:55.919> go<00:04:56.070> ahead<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.460> just

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
adjustments here I'll go ahead and just

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.640 
adjustments here I'll go ahead and just
start<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.030> bring<00:04:57.389> in<00:04:57.600> some<00:04:57.840> light<00:04:57.870> into<00:04:58.500> this

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
start to bring in some light into this

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.460 
start to bring in some light into this
area<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.660> the<00:05:00.660> nice<00:05:00.810> thing<00:05:00.840> about<00:05:01.110> using

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
area and the nice thing about using

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.969 
area and the nice thing about using
Camera<00:05:02.070> Raw<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.669> that<00:05:03.120> Camera<00:05:03.479> Raw<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:04.650> taps

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
Camera Raw is that Camera Raw just taps

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.070 
Camera Raw is that Camera Raw just taps
into<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.370> full<00:05:05.880> power<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.539> image<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:06.960> mean

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
into the full power of the image I mean

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.629 
into the full power of the image I mean
there's<00:05:07.199> so<00:05:07.380> much<00:05:07.500> information<00:05:07.710> there<00:05:08.430> and

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
there's so much information there and

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.090 
there's so much information there and
the<00:05:09.210> way<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.510> Camera<00:05:09.810> Raw<00:05:09.930> processes<00:05:10.620> images

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
the way that Camera Raw processes images

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.490 
the way that Camera Raw processes images
is<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.520> strong<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.240> this<00:05:12.810> can<00:05:13.050> really<00:05:13.350> help

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
is so strong that this can really help

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800 
is so strong that this can really help
out<00:05:13.740> all<00:05:14.610> right<00:05:14.789> well<00:05:15.030> we're<00:05:15.389> bringing<00:05:15.720> in

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
out all right well we're bringing in

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.689 
out all right well we're bringing in
some<00:05:15.960> nice<00:05:16.139> brightness<00:05:16.740> here<00:05:17.070> but<00:05:17.400> we're<00:05:17.550> also

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
some nice brightness here but we're also

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.150 
some nice brightness here but we're also
introducing<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.449> little<00:05:18.570> issue<00:05:18.900> no<00:05:19.770> big<00:05:19.949> deal

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
introducing a little issue no big deal

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.129 
introducing a little issue no big deal
we'll<00:05:20.340> fix<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.699> in<00:05:20.820> just<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:21.210> second<00:05:21.660> I'll

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
we'll fix that in just a second I'll

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.529 
we'll fix that in just a second I'll
zoom<00:05:22.470> out<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.680> bit<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.400> then<00:05:24.060> I'm<00:05:24.180> gonna<00:05:24.300> go

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
zoom out a bit and then I'm gonna go

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.730 
zoom out a bit and then I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:24.870> work<00:05:24.960> on<00:05:25.199> a<00:05:25.229> couple<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.650> these

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
ahead and work on a couple of these

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.080 
ahead and work on a couple of these
other<00:05:25.979> little<00:05:26.280> shadows<00:05:26.669> here<00:05:26.850> just

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
other little shadows here just

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.060 
other little shadows here just
diminishing<00:05:27.690> some<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.440> shadows<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:28.949> I'm

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
diminishing some of the shadows that I'm

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.370 
diminishing some of the shadows that I'm
noticing<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.850> think<00:05:30.479> would<00:05:30.630> be<00:05:30.750> nice<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.169> take

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
noticing I think would be nice to take

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.010 
noticing I think would be nice to take
back<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> little<00:05:32.010> bit<00:05:32.240> then<00:05:33.240> what<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.539> want<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.840> do

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
back a little bit then what I want to do

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.110 
back a little bit then what I want to do
is<00:05:34.289> look<00:05:34.530> at<00:05:34.650> my<00:05:34.800> before<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.280> after<00:05:35.460> here<00:05:36.000> we

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
is look at my before and after here we

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.390 
is look at my before and after here we
have<00:05:36.270> before<00:05:36.750> and<00:05:37.050> then<00:05:37.740> after

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
have before and then after

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.700 
have before and then after
well<00:05:39.360> one<00:05:39.539> of<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.690> issues<00:05:39.780> I'm<00:05:40.139> noticing<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.680> a

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
well one of the issues I'm noticing is a

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.580 
well one of the issues I'm noticing is a
bit<00:05:40.950> of<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.160> color<00:05:41.460> shift<00:05:41.900> we<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.080> change<00:05:43.349> this

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
bit of a color shift we can change this

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.620 
bit of a color shift we can change this
layer<00:05:43.919> blending<00:05:43.950> mode<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.789> luminosity<00:05:44.970> and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
layer blending mode to luminosity and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.659 
layer blending mode to luminosity and
sometimes<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.650> will<00:05:46.770> give<00:05:46.950> us<00:05:46.979> just<00:05:47.400> what<00:05:47.550> we

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
sometimes that will give us just what we

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.610 
sometimes that will give us just what we
need<00:05:47.910> before<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.750> then<00:05:49.020> after

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
need before and then after

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.950 
need before and then after
gives<00:05:50.340> us<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.669> brightening<00:05:51.270> effect<00:05:51.660> without

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
gives us that brightening effect without

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.100 
gives us that brightening effect without
all<00:05:52.410> of<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.680> color<00:05:52.919> shift<00:05:53.389> okay<00:05:54.389> with<00:05:55.020> a

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
all of the color shift okay with a

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.540 
all of the color shift okay with a
little<00:05:55.320> bit<00:05:55.440> bigger<00:05:55.680> brush<00:05:55.949> I'm<00:05:56.280> just<00:05:56.310> gonna

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
lower portion of the image is just a bit

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.070 
lower portion of the image is just a bit
too<00:06:31.979> dark<00:06:32.160> for<00:06:32.280> me<00:06:32.639> so<00:06:33.150> again<00:06:33.360> just<00:06:33.630> painting

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
too dark for me so again just painting

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.649 
too dark for me so again just painting
in<00:06:34.320> some<00:06:34.919> of<00:06:35.039> these<00:06:35.159> adjustments<00:06:35.849> here<00:06:36.120> and

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
in some of these adjustments here and

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.050 
in some of these adjustments here and
I'm<00:06:36.750> going<00:06:36.930> pretty<00:06:37.200> quickly<00:06:37.820> don't<00:06:38.820> need<00:06:38.940> to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
I'm going pretty quickly don't need to

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.000 
I'm going pretty quickly don't need to
be<00:06:39.180> too<00:06:39.419> particular<00:06:39.659> about<00:06:40.200> this

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
be too particular about this

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.850 
be too particular about this
and<00:06:41.760> as<00:06:41.970> we<00:06:42.330> paint<00:06:42.600> this<00:06:42.750> in<00:06:42.990> we<00:06:43.170> can<00:06:43.350> bring<00:06:43.620> in

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
and as we paint this in we can bring in

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.550 
and as we paint this in we can bring in
more<00:06:44.070> of<00:06:44.790> the<00:06:44.910> effect<00:06:45.270> into<00:06:45.600> certain<00:06:45.990> areas

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
more of the effect into certain areas

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.020 
more of the effect into certain areas
I<00:06:46.700> think<00:06:47.700> that's<00:06:47.880> looking<00:06:48.360> just<00:06:48.900> fine<00:06:49.380> I<00:06:50.030> brush

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
I think that's looking just fine I brush

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.000 
I think that's looking just fine I brush
a<00:06:51.060> little<00:06:51.330> bit<00:06:51.480> bigger<00:06:51.600> press<00:06:52.440> eight<00:06:52.650> to<00:06:52.860> go<00:06:52.950> to

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
a little bit bigger press eight to go to

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.970 
a little bit bigger press eight to go to
80%<00:06:53.790> just<00:06:54.360> bring<00:06:54.570> in<00:06:54.690> a<00:06:54.750> touch<00:06:54.990> more<00:06:55.290> over<00:06:55.650> here

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
80% just bring in a touch more over here

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.920
