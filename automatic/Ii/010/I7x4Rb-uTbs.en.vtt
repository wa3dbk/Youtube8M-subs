card<00:01:35.299> obviously<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.360> couldn't<00:01:36.630> play<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
card obviously I couldn't play in the
next<00:01:37.320> match<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> sat<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> next<00:01:38.610> match<00:01:38.790> out

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
next match so I sat the next match out

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.260 
next match so I sat the next match out
and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.900> against<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> Leon<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.970> PSG<00:01:41.970> tied
