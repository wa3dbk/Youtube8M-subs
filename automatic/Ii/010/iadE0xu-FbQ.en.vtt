00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.900
 we have followed the guidelines the small 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.139
 four bases of putting an urban garden 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.180
 on the balcony and now what it is about 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.779
 is also not to be slaves of the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.119
 plant therefore I want to say that we 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.160
 we go on holiday well you have the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.850
 experience that effectively when 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.300
 you have gone on vacation 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.820
 the geraniums the flowers you have 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 left or someone to care for them or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.920
 you have put some irrigation system so 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.700
 simple as it can be good now 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 I will explain a simple bottle with a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.600
 system that what it does is moisten 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 to the ground without falling suddenly are 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.840
 small as you see small pacifiers 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.530
 stone what they do is water what 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.589
 it moistens and the plant absorbs it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.379
 that is to say what sucks is placed very 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.850
 simply in any crop that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 it can be perfectly is introduced 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.409
 in the crop and in this way then in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.430
 function of the measure of the planter 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.770
 Well with a jug with a bottle 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.490
 that are commercial commercial water 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.860
 with a small absorber so 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.160
 we have controlled the water throughout 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.730
 the time of holidays or weekends 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.100
 hot weather 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.370
 there is another system that is the same with the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.160
 same water absorption system but 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.860
 with a small bucket at a higher level 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.180
 what we have the planters 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.490
 we fill with water and introduce it into the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.250
 substrate in this way near the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.100
 plant with which the plant goes 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.920
 absorbing and maintaining that humidity 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 relative you need in the area of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.729
 we can incorporate a fertilizer 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.780
 liquid to water with that way 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.510
 we are feeding the plant with water 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.030
 plus the liquid fertilizer the food 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.390
 necessary supplementary in a moment 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.280
 determined 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.580
 there are other systems that we have in the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.220
 2000 which are irrigation systems by 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 drip say good for whoever wants 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.980
 put a slightly more sophisticated system 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.720
 can do with some hoses 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.900
 very simple to make a circuit a 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.000
 serpentine by the flower beds even with 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 a small battery programmer does not 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.030
 debate and plug in the battery balcony 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.080
 we can schedule that once or twice 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.440
 a day the plant is hydrated 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.180
 with this system encourage all the 2000 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.239
 offers you advice is not only 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.709
 sell but advise and any 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.420
 incidence that may exist in the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.209
 plants as diseases or 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.190
 or handling or lack of handling excess 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.410
 water etcetera etcetera we are going to 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.190
 correct for you to follow 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.190
 producing something of its own
