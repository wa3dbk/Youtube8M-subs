to survive perfect our food supply was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460 
to survive perfect our food supply was
over<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> roof<00:01:19.970> almost<00:01:20.970> enough<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:22.200> more

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
over the roof almost enough to get more

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890 
over the roof almost enough to get more
knowledge<00:01:22.680> others<00:01:23.610> say<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.210> advancing<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
knowledge others say it's advancing to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
knowledge others say it's advancing to
classical<00:01:25.380> age<00:01:25.530> however<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:27.119> still<00:01:27.150> call<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
classical age however we still call it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
classical age however we still call it
gaining<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.229> knowledge<00:01:28.970> as<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.600> we

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
gaining more knowledge as you can see we

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.080 
gaining more knowledge as you can see we
caught<00:01:31.049> sight<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> beast<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
caught sight of the beast this is the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760 
caught sight of the beast this is the
beasts<00:01:33.299> territory<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.350> marked<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.710> with

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
beasts territory and he marked it with

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
beasts territory and he marked it with
this<00:01:35.130> statue<00:01:37.009> if<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.310> dare<00:01:38.579> enter<00:01:38.939> his<00:01:39.329> lands

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this statue if we dare enter his lands

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.020 
this statue if we dare enter his lands
even<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.920> might<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.250> aggressive<00:01:41.340> toward

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
even more he might be aggressive toward

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.830 
even more he might be aggressive toward
us<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.869> did<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.840> however

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
us so we did not do that for now however

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
us so we did not do that for now however
we<00:01:46.770> were<00:01:46.890> having<00:01:47.189> trouble<00:01:47.549> finding<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
we were having trouble finding all the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.630 
we were having trouble finding all the
food<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> survive<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.860> could<00:01:50.520> not

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
food we need to survive we could not

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.819 
food we need to survive we could not
find<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.030> river<00:01:51.180> anyway<00:01:51.659> needed<00:01:52.470> water

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.770 

hypothermia<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> large<00:01:56.909> risk<00:01:57.299> over<00:01:57.540> here

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hypothermia was a large risk over here

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.459 
hypothermia was a large risk over here
yeah<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.770> had<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> keep<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.990> survival<00:02:00.990> was

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
yeah we had to keep going survival was

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.730 
yeah we had to keep going survival was
the<00:02:01.619> top<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.070> priority<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the top one priority for this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.789 
the top one priority for this
we<00:02:05.159> finally<00:02:05.430> did<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.320> making<00:02:07.530> weapons

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
we finally did we are making weapons

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.350 
we finally did we are making weapons
against<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> Beast<00:02:10.790> we<00:02:11.790> sent<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.150> brief

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
against the Beast we sent a brief

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.449 
against the Beast we sent a brief
scattered<00:02:12.900> they're<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:14.010> sure<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.370> he

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
scattered they're not sure if he

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.150 
scattered they're not sure if he
survived<00:02:14.819> or<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.440> hoped<00:02:16.680> he<00:02:16.830> did<00:02:16.980> for

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
survived or not but we hoped he did for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.000 
survived or not but we hoped he did for
a<00:02:17.220> long<00:02:17.400> time<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:19.020> Beast<00:02:19.260> already<00:02:19.650> prepared

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
a long time the Beast already prepared

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
a long time the Beast already prepared
for<00:02:20.190> us<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.790> seems<00:02:21.209> as<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.480> he<00:02:22.140> created<00:02:22.530> traps

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
for us it seems as if he created traps

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
for us it seems as if he created traps
against<00:02:23.310> us<00:02:23.459> we<00:02:24.120> could<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:24.450> allow<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.720> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
against us we could not allow that to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.960 
against us we could not allow that to
happen<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:26.010> needed<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> make<00:02:26.580> my<00:02:26.670> traps
