however<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.930> he<00:02:36.930> said<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.290> each<00:02:37.470> week<00:02:37.740> one

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
however and he said that each week one

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.320

of the legendary players will be

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.050 
of the legendary players will be
highlighted<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.080> basically<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.940> would<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
highlighted so basically that would be a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.280 
highlighted so basically that would be a
bigger<00:02:42.270> chance<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.750> picking<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
bigger chance of picking up that
