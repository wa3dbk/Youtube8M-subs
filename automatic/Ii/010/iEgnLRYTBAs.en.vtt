00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.620
 knew virtually all of a sudden 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.089
 I was in good relationship with them 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:54.979

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.850
 little trailed with their son what up 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.369
 like blood brothers like that we 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 met on loan at the base me I 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.170
 did was say music 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.619
 they once insisted one to one of 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.000
 my rehearsals so they felt the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.700
 same thing as me they really had 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 that love that came out in them for 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.869
 the music is where the slab her 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.140
 family 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.140
 it started 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.010
 his memory 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.380
 frankly 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.180
 everyone knows what I am with 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.110
 everyone but just there is a trick 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.020
 who tell me that I do not like no in the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.430
 artists of my generation instead of the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.170
 undo so that our music to 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.170
 we Congolese music can go 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.220
 in water even higher we lose our 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.000
 time to make shitty polemics 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.830
 ddd way it fits but in any case 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.300

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.490
