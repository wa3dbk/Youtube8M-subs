00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:16.080
 hello everybody now we're going to make a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:22.440
 earthquake the swan is made with square paper 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:28.770
 15 by 15 you can use this 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.880
 shape we will turn our earthquake the color that 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.059
 you want 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.730
 usually white we make them you in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 two colors 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.089
 let's fold our paper diagonally 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.089
 this account joining this carriage house 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.890
 very well and after done that we 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.900
 Let's get this line and let's join the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.900
 in this way 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:16.060
 on the other side we'll do the same 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.060
 thing but I will judge this line in the middle 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.990
 we will pay attention to the point is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.810
 well finished here very well done 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.840
 we'll turn the paper on the other side and 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.840
 let's join this line in the middle line 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.440
 which is already marked here that you can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.440
 be good 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 thus 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 very well 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.400
 the other line of this here we go to middle 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.400
 also 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.450
 marking khan 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 it will stay in this right format 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:33.980
 now we'll get the tip and let's go 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 join in that door each fold fold 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:44.840
 even touching the account of Claudius liked 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 Did you like it? Let's check it here. 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.710
 we mark with a finger and now we need 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.330
 double again we'll look 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.540
 divide this one into three parts will 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.050
 divide a part with more or less this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:11.340
 part of a third 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:15.200
 a third of this very cool theme now 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:20.550
 of friends we're going to double everything in half 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:25.160
 making this movement the figure became 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.590
 so the double in half 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:34.550
 We're going to get our fingers up a little. 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.980
 some pull a people that more or less 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.690
 this is the neck of the earthquake 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.690
 Tony, it's good here. 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.549
 or just as you can not calculate 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:53.819
 and the beak also wants to lift a little 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:04:02.400
 how were we going to score here and then? 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:08.970
 squeeze tightens ready our swan was 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:12.840
 elegant but she's lonely and they say 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:18.269
 the Japanese that when a gray is 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 form a couple of swans the way he never 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.039
 more and then paid when you make a 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:32.190
 earthquake make his companion so that 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:36.650
 they can find the hint of 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.650
 Today's skirting the case
