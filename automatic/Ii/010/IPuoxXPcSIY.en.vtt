00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.800
 hello how about youtube friends and 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.710
 Welcome to this new boxing today 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.560
 we bring you this gadget which carries 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.210
 by name michael sohn and good for 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.740
 Do not know quickly what is this 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.289
 good device as you can see here 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.500
 is from the adidas brand and well these 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.210
 devices are monitors for 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.890
 personal trainers to be 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.960
 monitoring our physical activity 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.400
 while we perform some 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.790
 exercise some routine 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.460
 we are in the gym and so on so 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.160
 well let's quickly open it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 and in this in this version the sun 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 we just have a bracelet and this 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 what is the heart rate monitor this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 will go on a good to see I will teach 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.000
 we called to open it as completely 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.410
 to see this is a band 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.410
 here the monitor is going 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.440
 A) Yes 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.830
 here as you can see here is the logo 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.730
 adidas brand, this band is going to go 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.500
 it's for the chest 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.990
 and this is the one that is going to take care of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 be sending our heart rate to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.620
 Bracelet 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.620
 in this device that we have here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.900
 they are there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.870
 right now I think he does not have batteries like that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 that in the review we will be seeing how 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.640
 it works now that it's simply the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.400
 unboxing 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.530
 and we can see this is removed here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.110
 obviously we have to unscrew what 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.360
 put the battery to the clock battery does not 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.060
 remember the model right now 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.940
 here is the power button here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.780
 He also has another little button and statehood 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.010
 although beyond in the good box then 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.130
 quick start guide guarantees to a 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.820
 small the band 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.880
 and so that's all roughly in the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.750
 next video we will be seeing how 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.750
 this device works 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 there are other better ones in this range of 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.969
 michaels 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.120
 so we will also be doing the 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:33.140
 unboxing of the michael bay being that is the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.549
 that goes on so to speak in category 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.019
 but in the review we will be seeing 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.180
 how it works what advantages it has and therefore 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.790
 everything a review like that has to do 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 that at the moment it would be all subscribe to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.420

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.799
 next boxing we will also go up 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.579
 some like it and we will also have 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.739

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.639
 android and good anything else that 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.519
 we are happening out there so without further 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.980
