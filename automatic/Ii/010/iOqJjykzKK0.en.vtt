what<00:00:05.540> you're<00:00:05.689> looking<00:00:05.809> at<00:00:06.080> right<00:00:06.290> now<00:00:06.319> is<00:00:06.500> the

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
what you're looking at right now is the

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.049 
what you're looking at right now is the
block<00:00:07.399> of<00:00:07.759> the<00:00:07.910> KZ<00:00:08.120> 650<00:00:08.809> it's<00:00:08.959> upside<00:00:09.289> down

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
block of the KZ 650 it's upside down

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.629 
block of the KZ 650 it's upside down
this<00:00:11.059> is<00:00:11.360> the<00:00:11.750> number<00:00:12.559> one<00:00:12.740> cylinder<00:00:13.129> or<00:00:13.460> the

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
this is the number one cylinder or the

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.209 
this is the number one cylinder or the
most<00:00:13.879> left<00:00:14.230> cylinder<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:15.679> other<00:00:16.070> bike

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
most left cylinder of the other bike

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.310 
most left cylinder of the other bike
facing<00:00:16.669> forward<00:00:17.000> so<00:00:17.119> you<00:00:17.180> got<00:00:17.270> one<00:00:17.480> two<00:00:17.509> three

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
facing forward so you got one two three

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.320 
facing forward so you got one two three
and<00:00:18.500> four<00:00:18.970> these<00:00:19.970> little<00:00:20.240> black<00:00:22.210> plugs<00:00:23.210> that

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
and four these little black plugs that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.630 
and four these little black plugs that
you<00:00:23.539> see<00:00:24.279> right<00:00:25.279> here<00:00:26.259> are<00:00:27.259> sound<00:00:28.039> dampeners

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
you see right here are sound dampeners

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.429 
you see right here are sound dampeners
and<00:00:28.939> they<00:00:29.000> actually<00:00:29.359> fit<00:00:29.599> down<00:00:29.750> into<00:00:30.080> their

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
and they actually fit down into their

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.710 
and they actually fit down into their
six<00:00:30.710> holes<00:00:31.009> let's<00:00:31.939> say<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.089> put<00:00:32.210> a<00:00:32.269> mark<00:00:32.570> around

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
six holes let's say I put a mark around

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.410 
six holes let's say I put a mark around
it<00:00:33.050> here<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:34.790> know<00:00:34.850> where<00:00:35.059> they<00:00:35.150> go<00:00:35.300> and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
it here so I know where they go and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.969 
it here so I know where they go and
these<00:00:35.570> actually<00:00:36.019> drop<00:00:36.260> down<00:00:36.530> into<00:00:36.830> these

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
these actually drop down into these

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.130 
these actually drop down into these
holes<00:00:37.339> they<00:00:38.210> fit<00:00:38.449> down<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.780> between<00:00:39.049> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
holes they fit down in between the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.890 
holes they fit down in between the
cylinders<00:00:39.589> and<00:00:39.830> act<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.629> dampener<00:00:41.629> sound

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
cylinders and act as a dampener sound

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.920 
cylinders and act as a dampener sound
dampener<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.739> resonation<00:00:43.220> I<00:00:43.699> pop<00:00:44.600> them<00:00:44.809> out

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
dampener for resonation I pop them out

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.259 
dampener for resonation I pop them out
when<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.170> clean<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.589> cylinder<00:00:46.010> all<00:00:46.159> up<00:00:46.369> and<00:00:46.640> now

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
when I clean the cylinder all up and now

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.759 
when I clean the cylinder all up and now
I'm<00:00:47.510> gonna<00:00:47.629> put<00:00:47.869> them<00:00:47.989> back<00:00:48.140> in<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.470> I'm<00:00:48.589> gonna

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
I'm gonna put them back in and I'm gonna

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.789 
I'm gonna put them back in and I'm gonna
just<00:00:48.979> use<00:00:49.159> a<00:00:49.190> dab<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.549> this<00:00:50.170> liquid<00:00:51.170> gasket

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
just use a dab of this liquid gasket

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.910 
just use a dab of this liquid gasket
this<00:00:51.979> is<00:00:52.129> typically<00:00:52.580> used<00:00:52.640> for<00:00:53.530> case<00:00:54.530> assembly

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
this is typically used for case assembly

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.070 
this is typically used for case assembly
on<00:00:55.280> many<00:00:55.580> Japanese<00:00:56.150> motorcycles<00:00:56.839> because

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
on many Japanese motorcycles because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.810 
on many Japanese motorcycles because
they<00:00:57.199> don't<00:00:57.379> use<00:00:57.530> gaskets<00:00:58.189> between<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:58.640> case

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
they don't use gaskets between the case

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.299 
they don't use gaskets between the case
halves<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.839> transmission<00:01:00.439> case<00:01:00.949> or

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
halves that is the transmission case or

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.840 
halves that is the transmission case or
the<00:01:01.549> base<00:01:01.879> case<00:01:03.280> they're<00:01:04.280> machine<00:01:04.640> very

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
the base case they're machine very

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.200 
the base case they're machine very
closely<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.350> used<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:06.950> a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
closely and then this is used it's a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.840 
closely and then this is used it's a
really<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> non<00:01:08.479> hardening<00:01:09.340> it's<00:01:10.340> quite<00:01:10.549> soft

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
really a non hardening it's quite soft

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.910 
really a non hardening it's quite soft
still<00:01:11.270> I've<00:01:11.539> had<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:11.929> tube<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:12.439> quite<00:01:12.890> a

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
still I've had this tube for quite a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.740 
still I've had this tube for quite a
long<00:01:13.070> time<00:01:13.130> now<00:01:13.549> I've<00:01:13.700> used<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.030> for<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.420> don't

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
long time now I've used it for I don't

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.289 
long time now I've used it for I don't
know<00:01:14.840> how<00:01:14.990> many<00:01:15.049> engines<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.670> I'll<00:01:16.789> use<00:01:16.939> just<00:01:16.969> a

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
know how many engines so I'll use just a

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.819 
know how many engines so I'll use just a
dab<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.750> this<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:18.560> each<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.070> these<00:01:20.829> black

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
dab of this on each one of these black

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.700 
dab of this on each one of these black
rubber<00:01:22.369> plugs<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:23.960> I'll<00:01:24.049> drop<00:01:24.289> them<00:01:24.530> and

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
rubber plugs and then I'll drop them and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.499 
rubber plugs and then I'll drop them and
force<00:01:24.950> them<00:01:25.009> down<00:01:25.340> with<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.789> screwdriver<00:01:26.270> or

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
force them down with a screwdriver or

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.749 
force them down with a screwdriver or
some<00:01:26.719> other<00:01:26.869> tool<00:01:27.079> into<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.409> bottom<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
some other tool into the bottom of the

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.219 
some other tool into the bottom of the
cylinder<00:01:29.060> isn't<00:01:29.509> sitting<00:01:29.659> here<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.929> actually

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
cylinder isn't sitting here it actually

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.099 
cylinder isn't sitting here it actually
would<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.590> top<00:01:30.799> in<00:01:30.829> use<00:01:31.420> these<00:01:32.420> are<00:01:32.600> also<00:01:32.869> a

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
would be the top in use these are also a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.179 
would be the top in use these are also a
black<00:01:33.590> rubber<00:01:34.270> item<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.619> was<00:01:36.619> not<00:01:36.770> able<00:01:36.979> to

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
black rubber item I was not able to

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.370 
black rubber item I was not able to
locate<00:01:37.520> new<00:01:37.549> ones<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:38.060> these<00:01:38.509> from<00:01:38.990> Kawasaki

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
locate new ones of these from Kawasaki

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.209 
locate new ones of these from Kawasaki
or<00:01:39.950> nos<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.960> since<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:42.710> not<00:01:42.859> really<00:01:43.189> a

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
or nos and since it's not really a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.520 
or nos and since it's not really a
critical<00:01:43.700> item<00:01:43.850> I'm<00:01:44.780> not<00:01:45.079> going<00:01:45.319> to<00:01:45.380> be

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
critical item I'm not going to be

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.309 
critical item I'm not going to be
concerned<00:01:45.920> about<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.329> can<00:01:47.509> see<00:01:47.719> here

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
concerned about it so you can see here

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.590 
concerned about it so you can see here
I've<00:01:48.740> marked<00:01:49.069> each<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:50.350> holes<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.590> these

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
I've marked each of the holes that these

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.730 
I've marked each of the holes that these
dampeners<00:01:53.600> go<00:01:53.810> into<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.929> base<00:01:56.929> gasket<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
dampeners go into the base gasket this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.129 
dampeners go into the base gasket this
is<00:01:57.889> the<00:01:58.009> base<00:01:58.159> gasket<00:01:58.670> right<00:01:58.819> here<00:01:59.240> it<00:02:00.079> is

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
is the base gasket right here it is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.419 
is the base gasket right here it is
directional<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.069> is<00:02:03.219> it's<00:02:04.219> not

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
directional and that is it's not

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.270 
directional and that is it's not
symmetrical<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.530> reverse<00:02:06.859> it<00:02:07.100> like

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
symmetrical if I was to reverse it like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.930 
symmetrical if I was to reverse it like
this<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:09.020> wouldn't<00:02:09.350> fit<00:02:09.470> proper<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.759> is

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
this it wouldn't fit proper this is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.880 
this it wouldn't fit proper this is
obviously<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> bottom<00:02:11.630> side<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.710> fits

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
obviously the bottom side but it fits

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.540 
obviously the bottom side but it fits
something<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:15.050> how<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.530> go

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
something like this is how it will go

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.170 
something like this is how it will go
on<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.270> engine<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.380> then<00:02:18.920> these<00:02:19.130> these<00:02:19.520> black

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
on the engine and then these these black

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.830 
on the engine and then these these black
rubber<00:02:21.110> plugs<00:02:22.030> sound<00:02:23.030> dampeners<00:02:23.510> will

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
rubber plugs sound dampeners will

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.360 
rubber plugs sound dampeners will
already<00:02:24.170> be<00:02:24.260> mono<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.800> I'm<00:02:24.890> going<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.100> go<00:02:25.250> ahead

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
already be mono so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.240 
already be mono so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:25.900> put<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.170> those<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.500> place<00:02:27.740> right<00:02:28.010> now

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and put one of those in place right now

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.110 
and put one of those in place right now
there's<00:02:29.240> really<00:02:29.510> no<00:02:29.720> need<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.820> overdo<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
there's really no need to overdo the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.980 
there's really no need to overdo the
adhesive<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.180> need<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
adhesive all you really need is just a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.570 
adhesive all you really need is just a
just<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.560> little<00:02:36.920> bit<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.220> you'll<00:02:37.340> notice

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
just a little bit of it you'll notice

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.550 
just a little bit of it you'll notice
it's<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:37.970> quite<00:02:38.210> stringy<00:02:38.660> that's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
it's going to be quite stringy that's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.700 
it's going to be quite stringy that's
very<00:02:39.860> typical<00:02:43.960> just<00:02:44.960> need<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.200> little<00:02:45.650> bit<00:02:47.710> on

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
very typical just need a little bit on

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.410 
very typical just need a little bit on
each<00:02:49.070> one<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.670> these<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:52.060> little<00:02:53.060> bit<00:02:53.210> goes<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
each one of these a little bit goes a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.350 
each one of these a little bit goes a
long<00:02:53.540> way<00:02:54.400> as<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.550> can<00:02:55.610> see<00:02:56.000> here<00:02:56.330> now<00:02:58.360> I'll

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
long way as you can see here now I'll

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.570 
long way as you can see here now I'll
take<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> screwdriver<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:00.260> push<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.740> at

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
take a screwdriver and just push that at

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.970 
take a screwdriver and just push that at
the<00:03:01.700> bottom<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.860> then<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.690> dtc<00:03:05.690> will<00:03:05.980> this

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the bottom and then the dtc will this

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.830 
the bottom and then the dtc will this
gasket<00:03:07.340> material<00:03:08.030> will<00:03:08.360> hold<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.780> place

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
gasket material will hold it in place

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.950 
gasket material will hold it in place
again<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.500> doesn't<00:03:09.680> take<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> lot<00:03:10.960> since

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
again it doesn't take a lot since

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.450 
again it doesn't take a lot since
getting<00:03:12.170> goofy<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.040> getting<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.370> on

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
getting goofy with it and getting it on

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.560 
getting goofy with it and getting it on
gooped<00:03:13.820> up<00:03:15.070> i've<00:03:16.070> opened<00:03:16.940> up<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.270> lot<00:03:17.390> of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
gooped up i've opened up a lot of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.840 
gooped up i've opened up a lot of
engines<00:03:17.870> where<00:03:18.050> people<00:03:18.380> have<00:03:18.560> used<00:03:18.590> our<00:03:19.340> TV

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
engines where people have used our TV

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.720 
engines where people have used our TV
and<00:03:20.090> other<00:03:21.040> sealants<00:03:22.040> which<00:03:22.160> are<00:03:22.310> excellent

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
and other sealants which are excellent

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.330 
and other sealants which are excellent
products<00:03:23.120> i<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.540> nothing<00:03:23.810> against<00:03:24.770> our<00:03:24.890> tvs

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
products i have nothing against our tvs

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.690 
products i have nothing against our tvs
in<00:03:25.700> any<00:03:26.030> form<00:03:26.360> reusing<00:03:26.780> them<00:03:26.900> appropriately

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
in any form reusing them appropriately

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.630 
in any form reusing them appropriately
but<00:03:28.700> i've<00:03:28.880> seen<00:03:29.120> an<00:03:29.300> awful<00:03:29.630> lot<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.810> them<00:03:30.640> that

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
but i've seen an awful lot of them that

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.780 
but i've seen an awful lot of them that
were<00:03:31.910> duped<00:03:32.210> on<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.660> thickly<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:34.610> they

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
were duped on so thickly that they

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.530 
were duped on so thickly that they
actually<00:03:35.030> ended<00:03:35.600> up<00:03:36.520> plugging<00:03:37.520> up<00:03:37.670> oil

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
actually ended up plugging up oil

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.680 
actually ended up plugging up oil
passages<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.350> orifices<00:03:39.830> people<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.790> guess

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
passages and orifices people I guess

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.760 
passages and orifices people I guess
think<00:03:41.990> that<00:03:42.760> using<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.820> little<00:03:44.110> was<00:03:45.110> good<00:03:45.380> using

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
think that using a little was good using

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.770 
think that using a little was good using
a<00:03:45.830> lot<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.220> always<00:03:46.550> better<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.240> is<00:03:47.390> not

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
a lot is always better and that is not

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.940 
a lot is always better and that is not
the<00:03:48.020> case<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:50.000> many<00:03:50.270> of<00:03:50.450> these<00:03:50.630> these<00:03:51.500> kind<00:03:51.890> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
the case in many of these these kind of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.580 
the case in many of these these kind of
situations<00:03:53.230> so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:14.580 

I<00:04:11.819> have<00:04:12.819> to<00:04:12.940> put<00:04:13.090> these<00:04:13.239> on<00:04:13.510> these<00:04:14.080> dampers

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
I have to put these on these dampers

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.699 
I have to put these on these dampers
obviously<00:04:15.190> before<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.610> do<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:17.699> base<00:04:18.699> gasket

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
obviously before I do the base gasket

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.960 
obviously before I do the base gasket
I'm<00:04:20.709> not<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.070> engine<00:04:21.400> because<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.790> base

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
I'm not the engine because the base

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.159 
I'm not the engine because the base
gasket<00:04:22.270> will<00:04:22.900> block<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:27.750> access<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
gasket will block the access to the

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.480 
gasket will block the access to the
holes<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.490> getting<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:33.130> product

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
holes and getting this this this product

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.610 
holes and getting this this this product
is<00:04:33.760> also<00:04:33.940> sold<00:04:34.419> under<00:04:34.600> other<00:04:34.840> names<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:35.320> Yama

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
is also sold under other names like Yama

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.360 
is also sold under other names like Yama
bond<00:04:36.750> through<00:04:37.750> Yamaha<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.680> think<00:04:39.100> it's<00:04:39.220> exactly

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
bond through Yamaha I think it's exactly

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.370 
bond through Yamaha I think it's exactly
the<00:04:39.790> same<00:04:39.970> component<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.600> think<00:04:40.630> Honda<00:04:41.169> sells

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the same component I think Honda sells

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.110 
the same component I think Honda sells
their<00:04:41.650> version<00:04:41.979> of<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.250> Honda<00:04:42.700> bond<00:04:42.850> or

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
their version of a Honda bond or

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.590 
their version of a Honda bond or
something<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.630> effect<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.910> Kawasaki

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
something that effect and the Kawasaki

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.860 
something that effect and the Kawasaki
Suzuki<00:04:46.900> do<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.919> gasket<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:49.120> base<00:04:49.300> gasket

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
Suzuki do to the gasket the base gasket

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.590 
Suzuki do to the gasket the base gasket
will<00:04:50.020> fit<00:04:50.260> against<00:04:50.770> something<00:04:51.100> like<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.600> so

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
will fit against something like this so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.180 
will fit against something like this so
I<00:04:52.630> had<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.930> put<00:04:53.139> those<00:04:53.289> plugs<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.830> first

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
I had to put those plugs in first

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.980 
I had to put those plugs in first
because<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.639> can<00:04:54.729> see<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.120> gasket<00:04:55.300> partially

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
because you can see the gasket partially

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.870 
because you can see the gasket partially
covers<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.010> holes<00:04:57.220> where<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.520> plug<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.850> going

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
covers the holes where the plug is going

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.460 
covers the holes where the plug is going
and<00:04:58.150> that's<00:04:58.270> why<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.449> put<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.750> black<00:04:59.020> magic

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
and that's why I put the black magic

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.629 
and that's why I put the black magic
marker<00:04:59.650> around<00:04:59.919> though<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.310> knew<00:05:00.460> which

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
marker around though so I knew which

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.500 
marker around though so I knew which
falls<00:05:00.880> over<00:05:01.090> which<00:05:01.320> didn't<00:05:02.320> get<00:05:02.440> confused<00:05:03.510> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
falls over which didn't get confused the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.260 
falls over which didn't get confused the
cylinders<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.169> already<00:05:05.470> been<00:05:05.590> honed

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
cylinders have already been honed

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.640 
cylinders have already been honed
they're<00:05:07.270> in<00:05:07.419> very<00:05:07.660> good<00:05:07.810> condition<00:05:08.320> they<00:05:08.500> had

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
they're in very good condition they had

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.450 
they're in very good condition they had
no<00:05:08.800> ridges<00:05:09.190> marks<00:05:09.700> or<00:05:10.630> damage<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.139> any<00:05:11.289> kind<00:05:11.680> so

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
no ridges marks or damage of any kind so

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.010 
no ridges marks or damage of any kind so
I<00:05:12.490> just<00:05:12.820> took<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.300> simple<00:05:13.840> 3xu<00:05:14.710> hone<00:05:16.020> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
I just took a simple 3xu hone the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.180 
I just took a simple 3xu hone the
lubricant<00:05:17.530> ran<00:05:17.740> him<00:05:17.860> through

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
lubricant ran him through

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
lubricant ran him through
oh<00:05:18.490> maybe<00:05:20.010> 3045<00:05:21.010> seconds<00:05:21.430> each<00:05:21.639> cylinder<00:05:21.970> from

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
oh maybe 3045 seconds each cylinder from

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.050 
oh maybe 3045 seconds each cylinder from
both<00:05:22.360> sides<00:05:22.979> clean<00:05:23.979> them<00:05:24.130> up<00:05:24.250> just<00:05:24.550> knock<00:05:24.880> the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
both sides clean them up just knock the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.550 
both sides clean them up just knock the
glaze<00:05:25.270> off<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.900> put<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.080> little<00:05:26.260> bit<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.470> a

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
glaze off and put a little bit of a

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.909 
glaze off and put a little bit of a
crosshatch<00:05:27.039> on<00:05:28.289> was<00:05:29.289> all<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.470> was<00:05:29.650> really

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
crosshatch on was all I was really

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.500 
crosshatch on was all I was really
interested<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.340> doing<00:05:30.430> in<00:05:30.940> terms<00:05:31.090> of<00:05:31.210> honing

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
interested in doing in terms of honing

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.500 
interested in doing in terms of honing
and<00:05:31.570> they<00:05:31.660> look<00:05:32.349> really<00:05:32.680> good<00:05:32.830> so<00:05:33.300> next<00:05:34.300> step

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
and they look really good so next step

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.670 
and they look really good so next step
will<00:05:34.750> be<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.900> wipe<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.229> down<00:05:35.349> really<00:05:35.560> good

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
will be to wipe it down really good

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.700 
will be to wipe it down really good
again<00:05:36.190> just<00:05:36.970> before<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.300> block<00:05:38.169> gets<00:05:38.470> trapped

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
again just before the block gets trapped

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.850 
again just before the block gets trapped
dropped<00:05:39.130> back<00:05:39.580> on<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.000> pistons<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.770> I

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
dropped back on the pistons and I

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.730 
dropped back on the pistons and I
settled<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:42.310> in<00:05:42.430> place<00:05:42.700> I'll<00:05:43.030> obviously

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
settled it in place I'll obviously

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.469 
settled it in place I'll obviously
lubricate<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.130> cylinders<00:05:45.639> with<00:05:45.970> assembly

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
lubricate the cylinders with assembly

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.940 
lubricate the cylinders with assembly
low<00:05:46.630> but<00:05:46.840> I'll<00:05:46.960> lubricate<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.410> pistons<00:05:47.860> and

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
low but I'll lubricate the pistons and

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.240 
low but I'll lubricate the pistons and
get<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.220> rings<00:05:48.460> oriented<00:05:49.120> properly<00:05:50.250> 120

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
get the rings oriented properly 120

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.190 
get the rings oriented properly 120
degrees<00:05:51.550> apart<00:05:51.580> I'll<00:05:52.300> go<00:05:52.510> through<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:53.080> in

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
degrees apart I'll go through that in

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.170 
degrees apart I'll go through that in
more<00:05:53.349> detail<00:05:53.680> a<00:05:53.710> moment<00:05:54.130> and<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.849> should<00:05:55.090> have

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
more detail a moment and I should have

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.909 
more detail a moment and I should have
to<00:05:55.330> put<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.539> base<00:05:55.720> gasket<00:05:56.289> on<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:56.650> that'll

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
to put the base gasket on so that'll

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.040 
to put the base gasket on so that'll
really<00:05:57.160> be<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.490> next<00:05:57.760> phase<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.330> couple<00:05:58.960> of

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
really be the next phase a couple of

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.170 
really be the next phase a couple of
other<00:05:59.200> things<00:05:59.470> I<00:05:59.830> did<00:06:00.010> clean<00:06:00.280> this<00:06:00.460> block<00:06:00.729> up

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
other things I did clean this block up

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.420 
other things I did clean this block up
with<00:06:01.720> my<00:06:03.539> sort<00:06:04.539> of<00:06:04.599> last<00:06:05.010> unit<00:06:06.010> that<00:06:06.130> I<00:06:06.190> bought

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
with my sort of last unit that I bought

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.540 
with my sort of last unit that I bought
recently<00:06:07.229> my<00:06:08.229> intention<00:06:08.740> was<00:06:08.919> not<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.130> make<00:06:09.370> it

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
recently my intention was not to make it

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.550 
recently my intention was not to make it
look<00:06:09.580> like<00:06:09.820> bran

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
look like bran

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.280 
look like bran
but<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.860> just<00:06:11.070> basically<00:06:11.460> clean<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:11.940> up<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.480> I

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
but to just basically clean it up and I

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.080 
but to just basically clean it up and I
wanted<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.920> patina<00:06:14.280> of<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.460> block<00:06:14.670> to<00:06:14.910> match

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
wanted the patina of the block to match

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.120 
wanted the patina of the block to match
the<00:06:15.300> patina<00:06:16.020> of<00:06:16.140> the<00:06:16.230> rest<00:06:16.440> of<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.950> the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
the patina of the rest of the of the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.520 
the patina of the rest of the of the
machine<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:18.420> that<00:06:18.450> didn't<00:06:18.870> look<00:06:18.930> out<00:06:19.200> of<00:06:19.380> place

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
machine so that didn't look out of place

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.310 
machine so that didn't look out of place
and<00:06:20.340> the<00:06:20.760> beat<00:06:21.150> blasts<00:06:21.450> or<00:06:21.780> they<00:06:21.870> rather<00:06:22.080> this

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
and the beat blasts or they rather this

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.290 
and the beat blasts or they rather this
soda<00:06:22.590> blaster<00:06:23.040> did<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.250> really<00:06:23.460> nice<00:06:23.700> job<00:06:23.760> I

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
soda blaster did a really nice job I

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.240 
soda blaster did a really nice job I
think<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:25.650> was<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:27.560> dirty<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.800> wasn't<00:06:29.070> really

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
think this was a dirty it wasn't really

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.510 
think this was a dirty it wasn't really
oiling<00:06:29.730> it<00:06:29.910> was<00:06:30.830> quite<00:06:31.830> dirty<00:06:32.070> though

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
oiling it was quite dirty though

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.910 
oiling it was quite dirty though
for<00:06:33.480> old<00:06:33.720> grime<00:06:33.990> and<00:06:34.230> those<00:06:34.320> kind<00:06:34.620> of<00:06:34.680> things

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
for old grime and those kind of things

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.600 
for old grime and those kind of things
so<00:06:35.070> I<00:06:35.130> got<00:06:35.310> it<00:06:35.430> cleaned<00:06:35.670> up<00:06:35.960> you<00:06:36.960> notice<00:06:37.580> put<00:06:38.580> a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
so I got it cleaned up you notice put a

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.910 
so I got it cleaned up you notice put a
piece<00:06:38.850> of<00:06:38.880> corrugated<00:06:39.510> underneath<00:06:40.170> the<00:06:42.920> block

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
piece of corrugated underneath the block

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.430 
piece of corrugated underneath the block
here<00:06:44.220> I<00:06:44.250> typically<00:06:44.760> do<00:06:45.030> that<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.660> if<00:06:45.810> so<00:06:46.260> if<00:06:46.350> I

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
here I typically do that that if so if I

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.170 
here I typically do that that if so if I
have<00:06:46.560> any<00:06:46.710> oil<00:06:47.010> or<00:06:47.370> grease<00:06:47.700> or<00:06:47.880> anything<00:06:47.910> it

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
have any oil or grease or anything it

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.010 
have any oil or grease or anything it
soaks<00:06:48.480> through<00:06:48.600> the<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:50.210> shop<00:06:51.210> collar<00:06:51.540> that

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
soaks through the the shop collar that

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.750 
soaks through the the shop collar that
you<00:06:52.080> see<00:06:52.350> spread<00:06:52.620> out<00:06:52.770> here<00:06:52.980> that<00:06:53.160> helps<00:06:53.460> keep

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
you see spread out here that helps keep
