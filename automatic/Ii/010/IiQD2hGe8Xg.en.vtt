somewhat<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.710> controversial<00:01:49.460> type<00:01:49.850> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
somewhat of a controversial type of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.820 
somewhat of a controversial type of
figure<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:50.630> maybe<00:01:51.110> y'all<00:01:51.350> can<00:01:51.470> look<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.740> up

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
figure so maybe y'all can look that up

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.370 
figure so maybe y'all can look that up
for<00:01:52.040> more<00:01:52.159> details<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:53.479> jump<00:01:53.870> back<00:01:53.930> into<00:01:54.290> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
for more details so I jump back into the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.980 
for more details so I jump back into the
water<00:01:54.590> mom<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.190> didn't<00:01:55.520> feel<00:01:55.729> -<00:01:56.150> how

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
water mom because I didn't feel - how

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.780 
water mom because I didn't feel - how
could<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.290> say<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.710> didn't<00:01:57.920> feel<00:01:58.040> too<00:01:58.070> safe

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
could I say this I didn't feel too safe

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.690 
could I say this I didn't feel too safe
just<00:01:59.390> walking<00:01:59.630> straight<00:01:59.960> across<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:01.340> once<00:02:01.549> we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
just walking straight across so once we

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.539 
just walking straight across so once we
head<00:02:01.909> back<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.210> Samuel<00:02:02.990> Adams<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.979> now<00:02:04.190> trying

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
head back to Samuel Adams we now trying

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.430 
head back to Samuel Adams we now trying
to<00:02:04.610> get<00:02:04.729> into<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> print<00:02:05.270> shop<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:05.960> we<00:02:06.170> cannot

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
to get into the print shop but we cannot

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.080 
to get into the print shop but we cannot
get<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.250> little<00:02:07.460> trouble<00:02:07.729> getting<00:02:07.970> in

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
get in it's a little trouble getting in

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150 
get in it's a little trouble getting in
and<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.420> optional<00:02:08.899> objective<00:02:09.440> at<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.830> point

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and the optional objective at this point

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.300 
and the optional objective at this point
is<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.970> remain<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:11.990> low<00:02:12.319> notoriety<00:02:12.830> level

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
is to remain have a low notoriety level

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.730 
is to remain have a low notoriety level
count<00:02:13.580> go<00:02:13.790> red<00:02:14.060> alert<00:02:14.360> come<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.930> conquer

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
count go red alert come on and conquer

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.590 
count go red alert come on and conquer
so<00:02:16.220> once<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.550> had<00:02:16.730> close<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.210> print<00:02:17.420> shop

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
so once you had close to the print shop

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.960 
so once you had close to the print shop
every<00:02:18.020> way<00:02:18.200> into<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:18.830> bust<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.400> blocked<00:02:19.700> off

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
every way into that bust it blocked off

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.780 
every way into that bust it blocked off
I<00:02:20.270> mean<00:02:21.080> these<00:02:21.230> dudes<00:02:21.590> got<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.890> all<00:02:22.010> God<00:02:22.370> but

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
I mean these dudes got it all God but

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
here because you won't deal with the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.710 
here because you won't deal with the
cards<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.220> could<00:02:28.310> potentially<00:02:28.490> provide<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
cards that could potentially provide the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.590 
cards that could potentially provide the
least<00:02:29.990> amount<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.470> resistance<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.180> run<00:02:32.390> over

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
least amount of resistance so run over

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.190 
least amount of resistance so run over
yonder<00:02:32.960> here<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.630> then<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.900> these<00:02:35.990> two

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
yonder here and then you see these two

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
yonder here and then you see these two
jokers<00:02:36.440> these<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.340> ones<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.700> dealt<00:02:37.940> with<00:02:38.030> now

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
jokers these the ones I dealt with now

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.140

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
I take they circle around the block as

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.020 
I take they circle around the block as
you<00:02:48.770> can<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.010> from<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> mini-map<00:02:49.640> look<00:02:49.880> like

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
you can see from the mini-map look like

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.520 
you can see from the mini-map look like
they<00:02:50.180> bolt<00:02:50.360> ahead<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.870> direction<00:02:51.020> so<00:02:51.440> we

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
they bolt ahead in this direction so we

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.370 
they bolt ahead in this direction so we
need<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.740> make<00:02:51.890> quick<00:02:52.100> work<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:53.900> wanted<00:02:54.320> to

once<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.190> would<00:03:40.370> take<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:40.730> down<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.239> would

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
once I would take it down if I would

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.180 
once I would take it down if I would
head<00:03:41.570> straight<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.110> go<00:03:42.200> take<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.440> down<00:03:42.709> after

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
head straight to go take it down after

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.160 
head straight to go take it down after
taking<00:03:43.370> out<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.760> first<00:03:43.970> red<00:03:44.269> coat<00:03:44.510> them

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
taking out that first red coat them

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.350 
taking out that first red coat them
dudes<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.620> see<00:03:45.830> me<00:03:45.890> for<00:03:46.160> whatever<00:03:46.760> reason<00:03:47.269> I

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
dudes would see me for whatever reason I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.640 
dudes would see me for whatever reason I
don't<00:03:47.540> know<00:03:47.600> little<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.230> might<00:03:48.410> be<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> little

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
don't know little it might be a little

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.440 
don't know little it might be a little
glitch<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.070> knows<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.120> would<00:03:50.269> walk

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
glitch you knows what if I would walk

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.530 
glitch you knows what if I would walk
around<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.110> curve<00:03:51.440> kind<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.489> almost<00:03:52.670> you

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
around and a curve kind of almost you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.509 
around and a curve kind of almost you
know<00:03:53.660> then<00:03:54.049> they<00:03:54.230> then<00:03:54.769> they<00:03:54.799> wouldn't<00:03:55.190> see<00:03:55.370> me

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
know then they then they wouldn't see me

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.340 
know then they then they wouldn't see me
so<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.970> guess<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.390> would<00:03:56.540> make<00:03:56.720> sense<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.140> don't

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
so I guess it would make sense I don't

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.270 
so I guess it would make sense I don't
know<00:03:57.410> but<00:03:57.560> let<00:03:57.650> me<00:03:57.709> know<00:03:57.799> your<00:03:57.980> thoughts<00:03:58.220> about
