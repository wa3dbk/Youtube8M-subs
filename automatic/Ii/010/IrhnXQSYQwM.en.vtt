00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello everyone I would like to share with 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.920
 you review what is in my 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 opinion the best screen saver 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.240
 that we can find for the engine or the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 moto gp second generation this model 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.239
 I had already tested it in the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.050
 previous generation of the engine or the motorbike 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.180
 g 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.149
 and the truth is that I have been there for almost a year 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.340
 with the position and I am more than satisfied 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.500
 in fact it has saved my screen a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.020
 occasion in which the mobile fell 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.469
 a height of half a meter with a luck 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 to fall with the screen and how can you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.260
 see it now or there is a small 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.999
 gap but thanks to this protector 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 because there is simply a protector and 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.989
 Now, if I want, I can withdraw the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 protector and the screen then I would stay 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.499
 intact therefore I can confirm that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.960
 it works quite well as you can see 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:03.420
 well it's a premium protector and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 the truth is that it is super thin here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 you can see that it zeroes with 24 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.440
 millimeters and the price when it 's something 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.049
 higher if we buy it with the rest 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.190
 of options but as I mentioned the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.470
 truth is that we are facing a product 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.070
 of quite quality 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.660
 when we open it, we can find everything 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.950
 what is included that is like the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.470
 previous model as a small cloth a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 wet to clean the screen 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.690
 Then another chamois to dry it and then 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.330
 what would be the screen saver in 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.550
 the right part as you can see it 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.860
 it's a really thin film but 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.070
 at the same time it is quite resistant 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 you can see that it does not bend easily 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.770
 and we see how good the feeling of 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.570
 quality is felt simply by touching it 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.150
 the installation process is really 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.800
 easy we just have to take the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.240
 wet wipe and pass it over the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.369
 surface of our motor or motorcycle gp 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.830
 to clean it then we have to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.140
 dry with this wipe and then we can 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.540
 Use these stickers to remove 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.820
 any particle or speck of dust that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.860
 still on the surface of the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.440
 screen and then we will simply have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.450
 than removing the plastic that comes to us 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.459
 here indicating as number one and what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.080
 we would place on top of the screen 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.760
 making sure it fits 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.140
 perfectly well the opening for the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.700
 speakers and that is not left 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.319
 the lateral out of place once 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.140
 placed simply we would have to 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.030
 press in the center of the protector and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.880
 the same then expand and there would be 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 perfectly stuck to the screen like this 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.690
 let's see it going as 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.020
 we had commented then first 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.770
 we take the wet wipe and open it 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.100
 and we went through the surface of the engine 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.430
 to motogp so that it is well 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.030
 impregnated and cleaned once we have 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.170
 finished then we simply use the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.269
 another chamois to dry and clean the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.769
 screen and now to make sure that 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.600
 there is no speck of dust left on the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.420
 screen we use one of these 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.450
 stickers to pass it on the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.070
 surface and now we have the step 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.070
 final that would be to retire 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 this tab and place it on the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.140
 screen once it is to our liking 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.320
 we just have to press on the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 central part and the protector himself 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.730
 will expand and stay stuck to the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.250
 screen this form gives mind in the video 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
 when you can not appreciate it but now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.760
 I say simply by pressing on the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.590
 center will be expanded and will remain 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.240
 perfectly placed and already for 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.570
 finish if you have some imperfection 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.720
 in some corner that is not right 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.120
 stuck you can use this kind of 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.850
 card that is included to give 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.730
 the edges and that way then leave it 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.020
 completely uniform me in this case 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.180
 well I was lucky I did not have any 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.120
 type of imperfection but just in case 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.060
 I'm giving it to make sure it stays 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.610
 completely perfect good as you can 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.130
 see the process is really simple and 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.830
 the result is the truth more than 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.660
 perfect you can see here that I do not know 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.579
 appreciate any kind of bubbles like 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.830
 it can happen with other protectors 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.020
 and the truth is that neither the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.960
 protector is completely integrated 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.360
 on the screen and to the touch the truth is 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.979
 that feels pretty good 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.150
 basically that's it if you're 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.830
 interested this protector in the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.620
