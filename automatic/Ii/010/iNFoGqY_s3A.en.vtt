00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.529 

add<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.570> sec<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.100> identical<00:01:45.100> almost<00:01:45.789> air<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.030> just

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
add a sec of identical almost air I just

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.499 
add a sec of identical almost air I just
the<00:01:46.689> portions<00:01:47.590> are<00:01:47.740> are<00:01:48.700> almost<00:01:48.880> identical<00:01:49.030> as

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
the portions are are almost identical as

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.249 
the portions are are almost identical as
a<00:01:49.539> small<00:01:49.840> one

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
a small one

00:01:50.259 --> 00:02:09.240 
a small one
there<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.310> go<00:01:51.399> I'm<00:01:51.579> gonna<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> bite<00:02:08.250> I'm

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
there you go I'm gonna get a bite I'm

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.120 
there you go I'm gonna get a bite I'm
gonna<00:02:09.429> end<00:02:09.519> up<00:02:09.610> being<00:02:09.729> bulky<00:02:09.970> these<00:02:10.269> cuz<00:02:11.140> um<00:02:14.130> no

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
gonna end up being bulky these cuz um no

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.940 
gonna end up being bulky these cuz um no
so<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.540> two<00:02:17.019> half<00:02:17.260> pounds<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.799> it's<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so if it's two half pounds so it's the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
so if it's two half pounds so it's the
whole<00:02:18.040> pounds<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.670> whole<00:02:18.790> pound<00:02:18.910> chocolate

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
whole pounds is a whole pound chocolate

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.270 
whole pounds is a whole pound chocolate
so<00:02:20.170> I'll<00:02:20.290> gain<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> whole<00:02:20.590> pound<00:02:20.769> if<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.190> eat

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
so I'll gain a whole pound if I just eat

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
so I'll gain a whole pound if I just eat

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
think they're anywhere from steady

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.970 
think they're anywhere from steady
smashed<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.160> mean<00:02:43.030> unless<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.420> get<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.980> go

somewhere<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.459> they're<00:02:45.549> great<00:02:45.790> dip<00:02:45.970> but

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
somewhere and they're great dip but

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.120 
somewhere and they're great dip but
usually<00:02:46.360> if<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.569> go<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> grocery<00:02:46.900> stores

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
usually if you go to grocery stores

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.360 
usually if you go to grocery stores
we're<00:02:48.130> never<00:02:48.250> anywhere<00:02:48.549> between<00:02:48.670> 69<00:02:49.209> cents<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
we're never anywhere between 69 cents to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.160 
we're never anywhere between 69 cents to
75<00:02:51.370> cents<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.910> almost<00:02:52.329> as<00:02:52.420> high<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.600> 80<00:02:52.810> cents

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
75 cents to almost as high as 80 cents

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.660 
75 cents to almost as high as 80 cents
per<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.530> those<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.190> small<00:02:54.280> packs

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
per just those just little small packs

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.960 
per just those just little small packs
so<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.720> were<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:56.049> ten<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.350> those<00:02:56.970> would

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
so if I were to get ten of those would

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.120 
so if I were to get ten of those would
it<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.299> equivalent<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.049> oh<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:05.260> it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
it be equivalent to this oh I think it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.910 
it be equivalent to this oh I think it
probably<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.609> better<00:03:06.790> Buy<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.480> mean<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.560> you're

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
probably a better Buy I mean if you're

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.440 
probably a better Buy I mean if you're
gonna<00:03:09.069> give<00:03:09.220> somebody<00:03:09.370> as<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> gift<00:03:09.609> give<00:03:10.030> them

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
gonna give somebody as a gift give them

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.910 
gonna give somebody as a gift give them
this<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.200> mean<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.530> looks<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.799> lot

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
this this is I mean it just looks a lot

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
this this is I mean it just looks a lot
better<00:03:12.069> package<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> lot<00:03:13.359> better<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.780> it's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
better package is a lot better and it's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.940 
better package is a lot better and it's
it's<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.010> unique<00:03:15.250> item<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.829> buy

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
it's a unique item but I think if I buy

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.069 
it's a unique item but I think if I buy
ten<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.280> those<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.700> think<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.299> much

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
ten of those I think I get as much

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.300 
ten of those I think I get as much
