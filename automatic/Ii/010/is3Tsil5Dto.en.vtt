just<00:02:31.720> sort<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.310> seemed<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> web<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> add<00:02:34.270> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
just sort of seemed to a web and add it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
just sort of seemed to a web and add it
afterwards<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.350> one<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:36.070> really<00:02:36.310> quite<00:02:36.580> nice

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760

this sort of clicker right here you can
just<00:02:49.060> tap<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> lot<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.080> PCs<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.650> that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
just tap like a lot of PCs have that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.310 
just tap like a lot of PCs have that
feature<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.490> well<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.880> then<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:55.780> to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
feature now as well and then to do to

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.020 
feature now as well and then to do to
detach<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.800> whole<00:02:56.950> thing<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:58.000> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
detach the whole thing you just have to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.140 
detach the whole thing you just have to
do<00:02:58.270> like<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.500> pull<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.640> you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
do like so you have to pull that and you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.300 
do like so you have to pull that and you
have<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.360> off<00:03:01.480> now<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.800> thing<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.010> might<00:03:03.250> want

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
have it off now the thing you might want

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.730 
have it off now the thing you might want
to<00:03:03.790> think<00:03:04.150> about<00:03:04.300> here<00:03:04.780> when<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.710> a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
to think about here when you have a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.330 
to think about here when you have a
reattached<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.880> not<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.450> have<00:03:07.750> yourself

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
reattached is not to have yourself

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.090 
reattached is not to have yourself
jamming<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.960> screen<00:03:11.590> like<00:03:11.740> this<00:03:11.860> like

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
jamming on the screen like this like

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100 
jamming on the screen like this like
because<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> screen<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.660> bit<00:03:13.810> heavier

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
because the screen is the bit heavier

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.340 
because the screen is the bit heavier
than<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.710> unit<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.490> bottom<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.630> if

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
than the unit on the bottom but if

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.390 
than the unit on the bottom but if
you're<00:03:17.530> not<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.770> sort<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:17.980> person<00:03:18.130> who<00:03:18.370> just

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
you're not the sort of person who just

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
you're not the sort of person who just
smashes<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> screen<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> lot<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.320> hope<00:03:20.440> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
smashes the screen a lot and I hope you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.680 
smashes the screen a lot and I hope you
aren't<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:22.000> won't<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.239> any<00:03:22.330> problem<00:03:22.660> with
