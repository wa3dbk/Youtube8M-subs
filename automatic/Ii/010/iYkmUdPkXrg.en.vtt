got this hair clip i'll take it out of
the<00:01:21.630> package<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:27.210> sort<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the package so it's this sort of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
the package so it's this sort of
nautical<00:01:30.350> anchor<00:01:31.350> thing<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> says

nautical anchor thing and it says
sailors<00:01:32.970> grave<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.610> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
sailors grave so that's that and it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
sailors grave so that's that and it's
good<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:39.720> sometimes<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> clips

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
good because sometimes you get the clips

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
good because sometimes you get the clips
and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> clips<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> wrong<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.210> for

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and the clips are on the wrong side for

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
and the clips are on the wrong side for
your<00:01:42.570> hair<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.710> part<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
your hair like I have my part in to the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.810 
your hair like I have my part in to the
side<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> i<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.820> have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
side so if it was to do it i would have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
side so if it was to do it i would have
it<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.570> side<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.049> makes<00:01:49.259> sense<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it on this side that makes sense so it's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.179 
it on this side that makes sense so it's
on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.520> side<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
on the right side so that's good and

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
on the right side so that's good and
then<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:54.390> pin<00:01:55.020> badge<00:01:56.869> which<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.960> do
