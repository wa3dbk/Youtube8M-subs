what I needed the most

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.070 
what I needed the most
now<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.490> based<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.000> lot<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.270> these<00:02:32.330> things<00:02:32.630> on<00:02:32.870> how

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
now I based a lot of these things on how

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320 
now I based a lot of these things on how
many<00:02:33.140> times<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:34.010> use<00:02:34.280> them<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> vault<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
many times I use them in the vault and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.720 
many times I use them in the vault and
how<00:02:35.450> useful<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:36.110> are<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.250> that's<00:02:37.340> why<00:02:37.580> my

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
how useful they are so that's why my

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.310 
how useful they are so that's why my
next<00:02:37.970> one<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.330> might<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.660> little<00:02:38.810> confusing

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
next one it might be a little confusing

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.770 
next one it might be a little confusing
but<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.620> would<00:02:39.860> recommend<00:02:40.460> getting<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.000> Boy

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320 
but I would recommend getting the Boy
Scout<00:02:42.140> Survival<00:02:42.830> Guide<00:02:42.950> because<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.820> my<00:02:44.030> three

Scout Survival Guide because in my three
playthroughs<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.080> use<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.860> lot<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.850> many

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
playthroughs I use that a lot for many

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.270 
playthroughs I use that a lot for many
different<00:02:47.270> things<00:02:47.630> now<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> next<00:02:48.860> one<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.220> be

it's still in the vault and that gives
them<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.430> much<00:03:10.730> better<00:03:10.940> chance<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.750> surviving

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
them a much better chance of surviving

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.930 
them a much better chance of surviving
in<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> wastelands<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.340> coming<00:03:13.640> back<00:03:13.910> with

food and supplies now other things that
you<00:03:16.910> could<00:03:17.180> get<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.780> don't<00:03:17.990> necessarily

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you could get but you don't necessarily

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.910 
intuitive something like the med kit
really<00:03:22.790> isn't<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.270> useful<00:03:23.540> only<00:03:24.230> because

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
really isn't that useful only because

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.310 
really isn't that useful only because
you<00:03:25.310> only<00:03:25.520> get<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.970> use<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.300> once<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:27.080> lot<00:03:27.290> of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
you only get to use it once and a lot of

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.710 
you only get to use it once and a lot of
times<00:03:27.710> especially<00:03:28.400> when<00:03:28.940> people<00:03:29.180> get<00:03:29.330> sick

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
times especially when people get sick

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.510 
times especially when people get sick
everyone<00:03:30.440> gets<00:03:30.680> sick<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.370> only

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
everyone gets sick and you can only

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.510 
everyone gets sick and you can only
choose<00:03:31.790> one<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> people<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.560> get<00:03:33.710> better

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
choose one of the people to get better

using<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.910> med<00:03:35.090> kit<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.840> it's<00:03:36.050> kind<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.560> a

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
using the med kit so it's kind of a

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.680 
using the med kit so it's kind of a
one-time<00:03:37.220> use<00:03:37.490> only<00:03:37.760> thing<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.390> it's<00:03:38.510> not

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.020 
don't bother getting those items are
kind<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.750> useless<00:04:12.050> in<00:04:12.320> every<00:04:12.680> way<00:04:12.860> now<00:04:13.700> like<00:04:13.880> I

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
kind of useless in every way now like I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.000 
kind of useless in every way now like I
said<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.510> should<00:04:14.840> go<00:04:14.990> in<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.230> scavenge<00:04:15.740> mode

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
said you should go in to scavenge mode

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.830 
said you should go in to scavenge mode
which<00:04:16.280> basically<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.390> only<00:04:17.660> thing

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
which basically this is the only thing

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.370 
which basically this is the only thing
you<00:04:17.959> do<00:04:18.140> all<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.590> do<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.950> do

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you do all you do is do

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.979 
you do all you do is do
scavenge<00:04:20.010> mode<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.550> I<00:04:20.910> would<00:04:21.060> practice<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.750> lot

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
scavenge mode and I would practice a lot

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.550 
scavenge mode and I would practice a lot
because<00:04:22.950> I've<00:04:23.340> played<00:04:24.210> scavenge<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.140> bunch<00:04:25.410> and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
because I've played scavenge a bunch and

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.430 
because I've played scavenge a bunch and
I've<00:04:25.650> gotten<00:04:25.890> much<00:04:26.160> better<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:27.170> when<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.290> do

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
I've gotten much better and when you do

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.860 
I've gotten much better and when you do
a<00:04:28.470> scavenge<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.370> full<00:04:29.550> apocalypse<00:04:30.120> mode<00:04:30.390> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
a scavenge in a full apocalypse mode the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.600 
a scavenge in a full apocalypse mode the
scavenge<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.010> make-it-or-break-it

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
scavenge is the make-it-or-break-it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.600 
scavenge is the make-it-or-break-it
stage<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.750> fuck<00:04:34.290> up<00:04:34.500> your<00:04:34.650> scavenge<00:04:35.160> you

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
stage if you fuck up your scavenge you

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.910 
stage if you fuck up your scavenge you
will<00:04:35.760> not<00:04:35.970> make<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.660> your<00:04:36.720> shelter<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:37.830> you

will not make it in your shelter so you

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.310
