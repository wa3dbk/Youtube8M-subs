but<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.940> pop<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.180> filter<00:04:38.720> out<00:04:38.900> really

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
but you can pop that filter out really

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.670 
but you can pop that filter out really
easy<00:04:40.040> comes<00:04:40.370> out<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.670> couple<00:04:40.850> seconds<00:04:41.680> can

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
easy comes out of a couple seconds can

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.959 
easy comes out of a couple seconds can
you<00:04:42.800> pop<00:04:43.040> in<00:04:43.280> whoops

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
you pop in whoops

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.639 
you pop in whoops
red<00:04:45.119> filter<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:46.079> that's<00:04:46.259> going<00:04:46.379> to<00:04:46.439> be<00:04:46.559> your

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:46.649 
red filter and that's going to be your

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.829 
red filter and that's going to be your
higher<00:04:46.860> protection<00:04:47.459> Volga<00:04:47.849> it's<00:04:48.360> over<00:04:48.599> louder

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:48.839 
higher protection Volga it's over louder

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:51.979 
higher protection Volga it's over louder
yeah<00:04:49.319> so<00:04:49.649> for<00:04:49.860> louder<00:04:50.039> situations<00:04:50.989> you're

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:51.989 
yeah so for louder situations you're

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:53.600 
yeah so for louder situations you're
playing<00:04:52.259> with<00:04:52.559> a<00:04:52.739> kid<00:04:52.979> where<00:04:53.129> your<00:04:53.249> next<00:04:53.399> to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
playing with a kid where your next to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.639 
playing with a kid where your next to
the<00:04:53.699> amplifiers<00:04:54.419> you're<00:04:55.139> going<00:04:55.289> to<00:04:55.349> arena

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:55.649 
the amplifiers you're going to arena

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.379 
the amplifiers you're going to arena
where<00:04:56.159> there's<00:04:56.309> a<00:04:56.369> letter<00:04:56.489> HECO<00:04:56.849> going<00:04:57.209> back

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
where there's a letter HECO going back

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.399 
where there's a letter HECO going back
and<00:04:57.539> forward<00:04:57.779> that's<00:04:57.989> going<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.229> be<00:04:58.319> your

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
and forward that's going to be your

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.679 
and forward that's going to be your
higher<00:04:58.619> protection<00:04:59.189> and<00:04:59.699> reduce<00:04:59.999> the<00:05:00.119> volume

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.579 

alright<00:05:03.689> so<00:05:03.779> I<00:05:03.809> got<00:05:03.839> nineteen<00:05:04.259> sixty<00:05:04.559> four

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:04.589 
alright so I got nineteen sixty four

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:06.709 
alright so I got nineteen sixty four
years<00:05:05.039> here<00:05:05.429> give<00:05:06.149> tell<00:05:06.329> us<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:06.479> little<00:05:06.569> bit

a<00:05:27.680> lot<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.710> fresh<00:05:29.040> meat<00:05:29.280> from<00:05:29.490> here

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
a lot of fresh meat from here

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.540 
a lot of fresh meat from here
cheers<00:05:32.230> you<00:05:32.380> look<00:05:32.620> like

you<00:05:33.910> get<00:05:34.000> tribute<00:05:34.300> is<00:05:34.420> about<00:05:34.660> a<00:05:34.690> pressure<00:05:34.990> in

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
you get tribute is about a pressure in

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.780 
you get tribute is about a pressure in
here<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.770> that's<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.040> eardrum<00:05:36.430> right<00:05:36.580> there's

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
here so that's the eardrum right there's

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.320 
here so that's the eardrum right there's
read<00:05:37.300> this

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.590 

ok<00:05:40.870> what

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.980 

just<00:05:44.140> as<00:05:44.440> a<00:05:44.470> division

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990

your<00:05:47.440> body<00:05:47.650> has<00:05:47.740> been<00:05:47.920> at<00:05:48.010> engineer<00:05:48.580> drop<00:05:48.850> off

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
your body has been at engineer drop off

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.460 
your body has been at engineer drop off
with<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:49.540> amount<00:05:49.720> of<00:05:49.870> pressure<00:05:50.020> being<00:05:50.320> put

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
with that amount of pressure being put

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.980 
with that amount of pressure being put
on<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.740> from

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
on it from

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.010 
on it from
on<00:05:52.050> within<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.830> dream

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.490 

and<00:05:55.310> that<00:05:56.310> causes<00:05:56.490> your<00:05:56.789> job<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.810> tense<00:05:58.050> up<00:05:58.229> and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
and that causes your job to tense up and

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.450 
and that causes your job to tense up and
once<00:05:59.039> that<00:05:59.099> is<00:05:59.340> up<00:05:59.870> your<00:06:00.870> your<00:06:01.440> auditory<00:06:01.949> range

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
once that is up your your auditory range

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.029 
once that is up your your auditory range
goes<00:06:02.879> down<00:06:03.180> okay<00:06:03.720> so<00:06:04.229> what<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:04.770> technology

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
goes down okay so what this technology

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.360 
goes down okay so what this technology
does<00:06:05.639> is<00:06:05.909> it<00:06:06.060> places<00:06:06.479> a

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.530 

it's<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.460> micron<00:06:10.820> theme<00:06:11.030> which<00:06:11.210> is<00:06:11.300> thinner

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
it's a micron theme which is thinner

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.510 
it's a micron theme which is thinner
than<00:06:11.630> your<00:06:11.870> eardrum

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
than your eardrum

than your eardrum
the<00:06:13.699> least<00:06:13.970> resistance<00:06:14.150> will<00:06:14.599> come<00:06:14.780> in<00:06:15.020> and

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
the least resistance will come in and

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.100 
the least resistance will come in and
then<00:06:17.770> yes<00:06:18.789> so<00:06:19.789> that<00:06:20.389> is<00:06:20.539> going<00:06:20.720> to<00:06:20.780> increase

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
then yes so that is going to increase

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.740 
then yes so that is going to increase
