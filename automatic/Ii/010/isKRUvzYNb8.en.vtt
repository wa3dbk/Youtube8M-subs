the mold to help them take on the new
PIN<00:02:12.110> shape<00:02:12.549> I'm<00:02:13.549> making<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> mold<00:02:14.209> out<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.540> two

PIN shape I'm making the mold out of two

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.140 
PIN shape I'm making the mold out of two
by<00:02:14.959> ten<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.470> some<00:02:15.709> dowels<00:02:15.980> only<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> didn't

have<00:02:17.239> enough<00:02:17.450> dowel<00:02:17.690> rod<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> found<00:02:18.530> these

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
have enough dowel rod so I found these

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.020

colored<00:02:19.070> pencils<00:02:19.430> which<00:02:19.730> should<00:02:19.910> work

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
colored pencils which should work

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.869

perfectly

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.369

and<00:02:30.560> bottom<00:02:30.680> rings<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.459> traced<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.970> circle

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
and bottom rings so I traced a circle

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.280 

I<00:03:06.970> sanded<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.060> faces<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.690> circles<00:03:09.050> with

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:29.020 

I<00:03:26.710> soaked<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:27.920> strips<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.310> hot<00:03:28.490> water<00:03:28.730> for

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
I soaked the strips in hot water for

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.820 
I soaked the strips in hot water for
about<00:03:29.120> 30<00:03:29.600> minutes<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.200> immediately<00:03:30.560> put

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
about 30 minutes and immediately put

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.250 
about 30 minutes and immediately put
them<00:03:30.980> into<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.310> form<00:03:31.550> my<00:03:32.450> pencils<00:03:32.870> weren't

them into the form my pencils weren't

them into the form my pencils weren't
very<00:03:33.440> tall<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.310> only<00:03:34.400> do<00:03:34.580> three<00:03:34.940> at<00:03:35.000> a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
very tall so I can only do three at a

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.560 
very tall so I can only do three at a
time<00:03:35.270> but<00:03:35.900> at<00:03:36.350> least<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.770> looked<00:03:37.070> cool<00:03:37.250> I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.880 

needed<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.690> make<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.840> groove<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.530> top<00:03:42.740> and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
needed to make a groove in the top and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.500 
needed to make a groove in the top and
bottom<00:03:43.190> rings<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.760> put<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.030> strip's<00:03:44.330> in

during<00:03:44.780> assemblies<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.440> rigged<00:03:46.250> up<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.580> jig

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
during assemblies I rigged up this jig

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.330 
during assemblies I rigged up this jig
on<00:03:47.060> my<00:03:47.180> table<00:03:47.510> saw<00:03:47.690> but<00:03:48.650> let<00:03:48.800> me<00:03:48.920> spin<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
on my table saw but let me spin the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.130 
on my table saw but let me spin the
piece<00:03:49.550> while<00:03:49.910> raising<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.660> height<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
piece while raising the height of the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.070 
piece while raising the height of the
blade<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:52.010> carve<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> groove<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.870> worked

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
blade and carve out a groove it worked

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.870 
blade and carve out a groove it worked
well<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.920> didn't<00:03:55.160> feel<00:03:55.310> like<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.640> safest

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
well but it didn't feel like the safest

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:09.250 
well but it didn't feel like the safest
thing<00:03:56.180> I'd<00:03:56.300> ever<00:03:56.330> done<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:08.750> finish<00:04:08.930> up<00:04:09.140> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
thing I'd ever done to finish up the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.870 
thing I'd ever done to finish up the
Rings<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.740> made<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:09.950> three-quarter<00:04:10.520> inch<00:04:10.550> hole

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
Rings I made a three-quarter inch hole

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.670 
Rings I made a three-quarter inch hole
in<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.120> top<00:04:11.330> piece<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.810> allow<00:04:12.110> room<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
in the top piece to allow room to the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.100 
in the top piece to allow room to the
socket<00:04:12.920> cord<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:14.330> larger<00:04:14.690> ring<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:15.020> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
socket cord and a larger ring on the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:24.630 
socket cord and a larger ring on the
bottom<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.650> guess<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.310> let<00:04:16.459> more<00:04:16.700> light<00:04:16.730> out

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.680 

when<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.730> strip's<00:04:25.970> came<00:04:26.180> out<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.480> mold

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
when the strip's came out of the mold

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.360 
when the strip's came out of the mold
they<00:04:26.960> had<00:04:27.110> quite<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.380> bit<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.620> spring<00:04:27.860> back<00:04:28.040> but

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
they had quite a bit of spring back but

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070 
they had quite a bit of spring back but
they're<00:04:28.520> way<00:04:28.700> more<00:04:28.910> flexible<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:29.720> seem

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
they're way more flexible and they seem

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.350 
they're way more flexible and they seem
to<00:04:30.170> take<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.380> consistent<00:04:30.950> Bend<00:04:31.190> which<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:31.850> good

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.719 

after<00:04:34.960> finishing<00:04:35.259> bending<00:04:35.740> all<00:04:35.919> 18<00:04:36.250> boards<00:04:36.430> I

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
after finishing bending all 18 boards I

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.640 
after finishing bending all 18 boards I
lightly<00:04:37.030> sanded<00:04:37.569> and<00:04:37.689> finished<00:04:37.810> all<00:04:38.439> of<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
lightly sanded and finished all of the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.409 
lightly sanded and finished all of the
pieces<00:04:39.039> with<00:04:39.189> spray<00:04:39.400> lacquer<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.939> help<00:04:40.210> bring

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
pieces with spray lacquer to help bring

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.110 
pieces with spray lacquer to help bring
out<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:40.689> color<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.199> grain<00:04:41.530> in<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.740> walnut

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
out the color and grain in the walnut

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.369 
out the color and grain in the walnut
then<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.240> was<00:04:43.330> just<00:04:43.479> a<00:04:43.569> matter<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.870> pushing<00:04:44.199> the

then it was just a matter of pushing the
strip's<00:04:44.680> into<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.979> top<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.340> bottom<00:04:45.550> rings

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
strip's into the top and bottom rings

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.330 
strip's into the top and bottom rings
the<00:04:47.020> curve<00:04:47.199> of<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.439> blade<00:04:47.530> was<00:04:47.860> perfect<00:04:48.219> to

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
the curve of the blade was perfect to

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.890 
the curve of the blade was perfect to
fit<00:04:48.370> two<00:04:48.759> layers<00:04:49.030> inside<00:04:49.479> of<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.659> groove

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
fit two layers inside of the groove

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.809 
fit two layers inside of the groove
which<00:04:50.620> allowed<00:04:50.919> me<00:04:51.129> to<00:04:51.159> overlap<00:04:51.669> them

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
which allowed me to overlap them

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.550 
which allowed me to overlap them
slightly<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.569> in<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.990> end<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.229> didn't<00:04:53.469> even

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
slightly and in the end I didn't even

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:03.240 
slightly and in the end I didn't even
need<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.770> use<00:04:53.860> any<00:04:54.189> glue<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.490> hold<00:04:54.580> them<00:04:54.759> in<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
need to use any glue to hold them in the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.010 
need to use any glue to hold them in the
light<00:05:03.430> get<00:05:03.610> pieces<00:05:03.909> came<00:05:04.060> in<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.419> I<00:05:04.449> wired<00:05:04.719> one

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
light get pieces came in and I wired one

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.350 
light get pieces came in and I wired one
into<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.349> cord<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.039> socket<00:05:06.280> another<00:05:07.120> perk

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
into the cord to the socket another perk

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.119 
into the cord to the socket another perk
of<00:05:07.539> making<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.990> yourself<00:05:08.349> was<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.710> was<00:05:08.889> able<00:05:08.979> to

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
of making it yourself was I was able to

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.890 
of making it yourself was I was able to
pick<00:05:09.340> out<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.639> really<00:05:09.940> cool<00:05:10.120> twisted<00:05:10.659> cord

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
pick out this really cool twisted cord

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.570 
pick out this really cool twisted cord
that<00:05:11.169> had<00:05:11.289> a<00:05:11.319> braided<00:05:11.620> fabric<00:05:12.099> over<00:05:12.219> the<00:05:12.310> wires

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
that had a braided fabric over the wires

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.490 
that had a braided fabric over the wires
I<00:05:12.969> think<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:13.960> going<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.110> look<00:05:14.229> really

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
I think this is going to look really

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:32.630 
I think this is going to look really
awesome<00:05:14.710> with<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.159> style<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.610> light

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.250 

the<00:05:33.640> hole<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> bottom<00:05:34.390> was<00:05:34.600> way<00:05:34.840> too<00:05:34.900> small

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
the hole in the bottom was way too small

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.800 
the hole in the bottom was way too small
to<00:05:35.410> get<00:05:35.500> my<00:05:35.620> hand<00:05:35.890> or<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.340> bulb<00:05:36.520> inside<00:05:36.730> but<00:05:37.570> it

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
to get my hand or the bulb inside but it

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.240 
to get my hand or the bulb inside but it
should<00:05:37.990> be<00:05:38.110> easy<00:05:38.320> enough<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.710> change<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.040> bulb

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
should be easy enough to change the bulb

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.480 
should be easy enough to change the bulb
through<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.730> slats<00:05:39.970> on<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.360> side<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:41.590> since

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
through the slats on the side and since

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.100 
through the slats on the side and since
they<00:05:42.640> aren't<00:05:42.790> glued<00:05:43.000> in<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.480> can<00:05:43.630> always<00:05:43.750> make

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
they aren't glued in I can always make

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
they aren't glued in I can always make
extra<00:05:44.410> room<00:05:44.860> of<00:05:45.010> a<00:05:45.160> few<00:05:46.170> in<00:05:47.170> the<00:05:47.560> end<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:47.920> used

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
extra room of a few in the end I used

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.750 
extra room of a few in the end I used
about<00:05:48.750> $15<00:05:49.750> with<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> 6<00:05:50.440> quart<00:05:50.590> of<00:05:50.740> walnut<00:05:51.130> the

about $15 with a 6 quart of walnut the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
lighting supplies cost another 25 the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.920 
lighting supplies cost another 25 the
shipping<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:55.000> went<00:05:55.150> together<00:05:55.420> in<00:05:55.750> the
