00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.970
 there is more than one way to use a pareo 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.320
 stay in the video because today I'm going to 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:11.220
 teach 5 ways to tie it 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.290
 [Music] 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.420
 hello girls welcome to this new 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.520
 video where I will show you 5 ways 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 other than tying a wall what they're going 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.330
 to need is a very very scarf 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 the one that I'm going to use in this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 occasion is cotton but you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 can choose any other material i 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.680
 I recommend the siphon that has a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.570
 little of transfers but of course its 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.570
 It depends on each girl so let's go 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.579
 they are going to take their scarf they take it to the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 back side 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.230
 and hold them forward 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.220
 they take the two extremes and make a new 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.210
 simple 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.210
 accommodate 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.480
 tighten and repeat the node 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.340
 then I fix the front a bit 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.969
 and let it make a nice draping 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.969
 in this part 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.010
 [Music] 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.520
 for the second style they are going to cut a 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 little pareo taking 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.350
 one extreme 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.350
 and repeating 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.220
 on the contrary 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.420
 [Music] 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.420
 take back 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.350
 take half of the pareo clock and what 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 pick up 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.680
 and they are going to make a simple knot 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 but they will accommodate it on one side 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.180
 arrange 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 they re-tighten 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.300
 they take the two extremes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.300
 and twist them together 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.960
 then they will form 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.960
 a rosette 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.500
 as a gift again 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.890
 and this is the second style 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.800
 [Music] 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.070
 for the third style they take their 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.070
 scarf 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.590
 they carry it backwards and to the front 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 take the extremes 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.209
 and they make a new single 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 accommodate 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.940
 they tighten and this time they will change the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.400
 ends of the place 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 and take it back 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 and secure with a knot 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.429
 how they give 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.429
 [Music] 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.950
 and so they get a pareo with a collar 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.950
 halter 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.390
 by the fourth style they take their 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.220
 scarf is carried backwards by this 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.250
 time they will accommodate it at the height of their 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.250
 waist 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.380
 pick up in front 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.380
 take the two extremes 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.370
 and they make a simple knot 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.370
 remember to accommodate 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.360
 they re-tighten 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.579
 and secure the knot 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.800
 this style is very simple so just 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.800
 They have to fix the opposite 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.849
 for the fifth style they take their 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.849
 scarf and carry it back 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.530
 take the ends to the front 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.930
 they make a simple knot 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.629
 cross the sides 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.329
 and they're going to take him back there they go 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.070
 to tie to me does not reach me because 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.019
 I bring pants but obviously in the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.240
 beach we bring swimsuit so no 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.860
 it's going to be no problem my style 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.780
 favorite is the pair tied in the 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.729
 waist with draping in front can 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.350
 be yours tell us in the bottom 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.660
 where they can also leave us any 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.000
 suggestion talk or if they are going to go 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.580
 vacation and prefer the beach stay 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.740
