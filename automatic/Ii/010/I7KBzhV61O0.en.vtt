00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:03.850 
all right let's do this one differently

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.820 
all right let's do this one differently
than<00:00:04.089> we've<00:00:04.240> done<00:00:04.480> before<00:00:04.660> let's<00:00:05.170> do<00:00:05.500> the

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
than we've done before let's do the

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.790 
than we've done before let's do the
let's<00:00:06.520> go<00:00:07.000> to<00:00:07.060> the<00:00:07.390> lower<00:00:08.049> appendage<00:00:08.590> and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
let's go to the lower appendage and

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.850 
let's go to the lower appendage and
let's<00:00:09.160> do<00:00:09.340> a<00:00:09.370> mural<00:00:09.849> area<00:00:10.390> first<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:11.710> only

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
let's do a mural area first it's only

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.879 
let's do a mural area first it's only
one<00:00:12.099> muscle<00:00:12.780> okay<00:00:13.780> this<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.500> called<00:00:14.710> the

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
one muscle okay this is called the

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.759 
one muscle okay this is called the
tibialis<00:00:15.250> anterior<00:00:15.810> well<00:00:16.810> now<00:00:17.050> now<00:00:17.499> take<00:00:17.560> a

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:17.769 
tibialis anterior well now now take a

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.929 
tibialis anterior well now now take a
look<00:00:18.150> here's<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.210> day<00:00:20.189> look<00:00:21.189> what<00:00:21.429> bone<00:00:21.669> it

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
look here's the day look what bone it

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.579 
look here's the day look what bone it
you<00:00:22.179> have<00:00:22.390> radio<00:00:22.839> tibialis<00:00:24.449> muscle<00:00:25.589> right

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
you have radio tibialis muscle right

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.829 
you have radio tibialis muscle right
next<00:00:27.009> to<00:00:27.130> it<00:00:27.189> on<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:27.609> your<00:00:27.819> surface<00:00:28.300> has<00:00:28.539> to<00:00:28.720> be

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
next to it on and your surface has to be

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.760 
next to it on and your surface has to be
there<00:00:28.989> to<00:00:29.140> be<00:00:29.289> all<00:00:29.439> centered<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:32.560> go

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
there to be all centered but don't go

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.990 
there to be all centered but don't go
off<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.550> side<00:00:34.650> give<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:36.280> me<00:00:36.310> how<00:00:36.520> center

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
off on the side give it to me how center

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.380 
off on the side give it to me how center
we've<00:00:37.840> done<00:00:39.090> yeah<00:00:40.090> go<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.080> posterior

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we've done yeah go to the posterior

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.840 
we've done yeah go to the posterior
large<00:00:43.390> muscle<00:00:44.110> with<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.440> big<00:00:44.980> long<00:00:45.250> tendon

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
large muscle with the big long tendon

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.640 
large muscle with the big long tendon
and<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.840> probably<00:00:47.170> needs<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.620> little

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
and this probably needs a little

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.220 
and this probably needs a little
touch-up<00:00:48.130> right<00:00:48.700> here<00:00:48.940> because<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.540> paint<00:00:50.110> is

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
touch-up right here because the paint is

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.360 
touch-up right here because the paint is
coming<00:00:50.290> off<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.730> gastrocnemius<00:00:53.370> now

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
coming off this is the gastrocnemius now

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.060 
coming off this is the gastrocnemius now
here<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.510> only<00:00:55.930> way<00:00:56.260> they<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.500> make<00:00:56.829> this

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
here is the only way they can make this

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.530 
here is the only way they can make this
tricky<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:58.570> at<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.960> edge<00:00:59.260> right<00:00:59.290> here<00:01:00.540> you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
tricky look at the edge right here you

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.319 
tricky look at the edge right here you
can<00:01:01.720> see<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:01.960> gastrocnemius<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:03.400> then<00:01:04.210> you

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
can see the gastrocnemius and then you

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.249 
can see the gastrocnemius and then you
can<00:01:04.509> see<00:01:04.689> a<00:01:04.719> muscle<00:01:05.170> tee<00:01:06.450> let's<00:01:07.450> see<00:01:07.630> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
can see a muscle tee let's see the

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.580 
can see a muscle tee let's see the
gastrocnemius<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.609> the<00:01:09.969> muscle<00:01:10.390> d<00:01:10.630> right

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
gastrocnemius and the muscle d right

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.160 
gastrocnemius and the muscle d right
here<00:01:13.319> muscled<00:01:14.319> its<00:01:14.530> deepest<00:01:15.219> is<00:01:15.429> soleus<00:01:16.170> sup

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
here muscled its deepest is soleus sup

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.649 
here muscled its deepest is soleus sup
you<00:01:17.350> take<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:21.569> saw<00:01:22.569> I<00:01:23.219> hear<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.429> too<00:01:24.639> so<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.149> and

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
you take I saw I hear that too so it and

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
you take I saw I hear that too so it and
if<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.530> look<00:01:26.799> at<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.039> you<00:01:27.399> can<00:01:27.460> see<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.909> soleus

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
if you look at it you can see the soleus

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.239 
if you look at it you can see the soleus
you<00:01:30.130> see<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:32.350> Lisa<00:01:32.590> side<00:01:33.039> you

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
you see that it on that Lisa side you

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.719 
you see that it on that Lisa side you
can<00:01:33.459> see<00:01:33.490> clearly<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.299> as<00:01:34.450> part<00:01:34.719> of<00:01:34.810> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
can see clearly that as part of that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.279 
can see clearly that as part of that
which<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.909> gastrectomy<00:01:37.479> missing<00:01:38.139> and

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
which is a gastrectomy missing and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.129 
which is a gastrectomy missing and
gastrocnemius<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.700> superficial<00:01:40.689> ones<00:01:40.810> so

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
gastrocnemius just superficial ones so

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.080 
gastrocnemius just superficial ones so
it<00:01:41.200> was<00:01:41.380> charred<00:01:41.709> right<00:01:41.950> here<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.700> whole<00:01:42.880> air

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
it was charred right here the whole air

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.639 
it was charred right here the whole air
oh<00:01:43.420> yeah<00:01:43.899> it's<00:01:44.139> big<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.189> hold<00:01:45.429> back<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:46.029> your

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
its the hole saw lariat this whole thing

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.069 
its the hole saw lariat this whole thing
is<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.770> gastric<00:01:51.279> things<00:01:52.139> then<00:01:53.139> this<00:01:54.569> it<00:01:55.569> sets

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
is the gastric things then this it sets

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.940 
is the gastric things then this it sets
on<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.439> soleus<00:01:57.359> as<00:01:58.359> you<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.689> see<00:01:58.929> here<00:01:59.349> or<00:01:59.770> we

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
on the soleus as you can see here or we

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.990 
on the soleus as you can see here or we
could<00:02:00.099> take<00:02:00.279> that<00:02:00.549> off<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.729> say<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.270> Soviets

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
could take that off and say the Soviets

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.020 
could take that off and say the Soviets
they're<00:02:04.000> very<00:02:04.270> comfortable<00:02:04.689> with<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:06.030> okay

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030

now again I'm going to look interior

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.280 
now again I'm going to look interior
surface<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.519> yours<00:02:12.940> are<00:02:13.300> all<00:02:13.540> with

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
surface and yours are all with

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
surface and yours are all with
languaging<00:02:15.010> flexors<00:02:16.319> now<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.349> go<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.040> look

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
languaging flexors now I go to the look

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.380 
languaging flexors now I go to the look
lateral<00:02:18.880> aspect<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.440> part<00:02:20.769> this<00:02:21.390> shows

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
lateral aspect in this part this shows

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.020 
lateral aspect in this part this shows
muscle<00:02:22.900> fibers<00:02:23.410> right<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.610> called<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
muscle fibers right here it's called the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.940 
muscle fibers right here it's called the
tensor<00:02:25.630> fasciae<00:02:26.019> latae<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:29.200> tensor<00:02:29.650> fasciae

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
tensor fasciae latae the tensor fasciae

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.020 
tensor fasciae latae the tensor fasciae
latae<00:02:30.130> runs<00:02:30.870> into<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.310> cartilaginous<00:02:33.310> or

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
latae runs into this cartilaginous or

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.690 
latae runs into this cartilaginous or
this<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.720> connective<00:02:35.410> tissue<00:02:35.650> Band<00:02:36.040> are

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
this this connective tissue Band are

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.729 
this this connective tissue Band are
here<00:02:36.760> too<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:38.170> called<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.799> iliotibial<00:02:39.430> band

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
here too it's called the iliotibial band

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.850 
here too it's called the iliotibial band
okay<00:02:41.739> now<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.459> iliotibial<00:02:43.120> band<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:44.290> not<00:02:44.560> on

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
okay now the iliotibial band is not on

cool<00:06:11.919> so<00:06:12.550> this<00:06:13.060> really<00:06:13.360> runs<00:06:13.840> underneath<00:06:14.530> the

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
cool so this really runs underneath the

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.830 
cool so this really runs underneath the
longest<00:06:15.639> and<00:06:15.849> then<00:06:16.539> covers<00:06:16.990> these<00:06:17.229> up<00:06:18.090> cool<00:06:19.090> so

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
longest and then covers these up cool so

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.529 
longest and then covers these up cool so
here's<00:06:20.229> your<00:06:20.380> strategy<00:06:21.009> I<00:06:21.039> hope<00:06:21.370> when<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:22.389> go

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
here's your strategy I hope when you go

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.540 
here's your strategy I hope when you go
into<00:06:22.720> triangle<00:06:23.380> it's<00:06:23.889> got<00:06:24.069> to<00:06:24.190> be<00:06:24.310> the

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
into triangle it's got to be the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.089 
into triangle it's got to be the
adductor<00:06:25.060> longus<00:06:25.090> of<00:06:25.840> the<00:06:26.050> adductor<00:06:26.620> Magnus

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
adductor longus of the adductor Magnus

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.960 
adductor longus of the adductor Magnus
built<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.270> triangle<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.800> even<00:06:30.610> if<00:06:30.729> they<00:06:30.909> were

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
built the triangle and even if they were

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.809 
built the triangle and even if they were
to<00:06:31.389> take<00:06:31.599> this<00:06:31.870> off<00:06:32.169> you<00:06:32.979> can<00:06:33.190> still<00:06:33.520> see<00:06:33.789> the

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
to take this off you can still see the

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.450 
to take this off you can still see the
remnants<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.780> triangle<00:06:35.349> right<00:06:35.469> here<00:06:35.530> you

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
remnants of the triangle right here you

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.850 
remnants of the triangle right here you
still<00:06:36.759> I<00:06:37.180> can't<00:06:37.599> take<00:06:37.810> their<00:06:38.020> crystal<00:06:38.440> is<00:06:38.590> over

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
still I can't take their crystal is over

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.730 
still I can't take their crystal is over
so<00:06:39.849> you<00:06:39.940> go<00:06:40.060> beautiful<00:06:40.300> triangle<00:06:41.080> which

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
so you go beautiful triangle which

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.930 
so you go beautiful triangle which
longus<00:06:42.780> Magnus<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.289> Magnus<00:06:45.190> is<00:06:45.400> really<00:06:45.759> up

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
longus Magnus and Magnus is really up

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.120 
longus Magnus and Magnus is really up
here<00:06:46.240> as<00:06:46.419> well<00:06:46.659> actually<00:06:47.229> it<00:06:47.590> goes<00:06:47.710> all<00:06:48.099> the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
here as well actually it goes all the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:56.969 
here as well actually it goes all the
way<00:06:48.460> underneath<00:06:49.289> the<00:06:50.289> longest<00:06:53.250> cool<00:06:55.979> all

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
way underneath the longest cool all

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.689 
way underneath the longest cool all
right<00:06:57.699> let's<00:06:58.180> go<00:06:58.389> to<00:06:58.449> the<00:06:59.039> back<00:07:00.039> side<00:07:00.370> the

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
right let's go to the back side the

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.240 
right let's go to the back side the
problems<00:07:01.300> on<00:07:01.569> the<00:07:01.840> problem<00:07:02.289> side<00:07:02.590> that<00:07:02.860> got<00:07:03.039> me
