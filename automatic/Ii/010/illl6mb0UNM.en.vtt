00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.380
 Hello everyone, today we are going to do some 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.660
 funny nails with march like these 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.309
 that - a little bit I almost always leave 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 out there and good I love it and I wanted 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.640
 share a little bit with you is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 some nails that you are going to love and go 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.420
 to make different styles 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 Well, styles are for example 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.190
 this one is the cowboy cowboy by day and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 cowgirl night at night because he 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.270
 put a little bit of glitter so that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
 be more elegant more partiers 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.829
 more like running and then these others 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 two that would be more day by day 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 you can see more fun with more light and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.329
 this last style that would be more 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 elegant for the night for a wedding 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.010
 for anything of these then nothing 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 I'm going to catch 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 the blue enamel to paint me first the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.550
 nail and then nothing we're going to do 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.379
 simply the base 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.480
 the base we know how to do all but 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.290
 Well, he explained it again never 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.830
 it's bad 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.600
 remember I have my base and I'm going to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.450
 start doing the day nails that are 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.510
 these two I leave here the enamel and I'm going 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.510
 to catch it look at this red for example 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.950
 and it's going to be a point that we're going to take a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.230
 point here for example 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.610
 another important point here that we have left 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.100
 bomb because we're going to make an effect 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.520
 3d and on the other flight I'm going to make the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.079
 setback for example here one is small 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.359
 and here a bigger one we take another color 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.860
 for example this dark blue that is going to 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:45.420
 stand out a lot 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.740
 and do the same thing here we put a point u 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.040
 another point on the other side 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.950
 a point here for example and I'm going to 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.810
 change color I will now take a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.479
 red that this one is very pretty very cheerful and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.049
 I put it in the center another fat man here in 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 the center change color takes me the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.759
 green 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.840
 and again I do the same a small dot to 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.500
 see has taken away from me a little bit that this one 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 have too much 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.400
 very well this point edito and one more 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.890
 big here we would have our 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.680
 first base to which we can add 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.210
 all the colors that we want I will give 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.540
 one more here because I think that here 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.540
 there is a gap 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.530
 we already have the other one just now 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.140
 would wait for it to dry and before 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.320
 dry I'll cross with this other 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.350
 color that would be glitter we can do 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.310
 some lines crossed to the sides what 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.670
 that would be like that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.319
 and so we continue on another side and what 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.890
 same without going over the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.140
 little bombs because if we do not spoil the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.260
 drawing and the last one so look once 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.189
 tissue here we already have a nail 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.450
 we pass to the other the same thing we go back to 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.390
 do just the same 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.959
 the brushes in case they are not very 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.430
 full so that we do not get emborrone 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.590
 everything then now that we have finished 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 our nails day spots we're going to 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.060
 start with our party nails 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.250
 cowboy or blujin let's go to it I'm going to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.590
 start with blue jean nails that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.160
 we have here or cowboy and like me 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.080
 I like the blue so much, I'm going to put it 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.580
 another cowboy but darker than the one 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440
 we have 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.800
 we return to do the same as in step 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.800
 previous 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.769
 as we want it to be bigger or more 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.580
 small then we put more or less or less 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.010
 we have put a sheet underneath that 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.450
 you have fixed us before it comes 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.150
 very well just in case we drop a little 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.549
 of enamel which is then very difficult very 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.650
 difficult to remove let's put one that 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.010
 stand out with the blue that is going to be the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.530
 white for example and then nothing we put 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.170
 a white painting here another one here by 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.730
 example now we take the red 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.670
 that red is also the color that 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.940
 it is very well highlights a lot about 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.500
 the blue 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.590
 and I put here two points another here and another 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 here we already have it like this we are going to take the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.980
 green that this is a very funny green 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 and we put it down here in the center a 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.530
 little bit too 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.710
 and then this first step we would have 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.039
 done let's move on to use again 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.349
 the glitter this is the glitter 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.180
 let's say we have and we're going to go back to 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.949
 cross if you want to the other side 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.139
 distinct clear the first two that 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.759
 we have done and we are going to cross from here 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.830
 here always keeping in mind that no 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.169
 it's dry and we have to have 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.070
 careful not to go over the 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:09.150
 little bombs not to load enamel 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.550
 and this last one is already followed well 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.880
 even very head here I'm going to put you 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.210
 here in this in the nail we do what 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.930
 we cross from here here we cross from 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.030
 the tip of the other side 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.150
 we are crossing through and around here 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.150
 as well 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.090
 and the last step that little corner 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.850
 we have 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.949
 we finished the second step the plugin 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.960
 day for nothing have we finished this 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.020
 last step and let's move on to the last 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.850
 nail that is going to be a fun style but 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.639
 more elegant for any event that 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.310
 let's have nothing, we're already with the 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.770
 last nail and now let's take the 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.680
 White 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.080
 and let's make three points we're going to 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.530
 make a point of a little corner 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.530
 small 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:08.110
 another point a little bit bigger I'm going to 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.110
 take a little more enamel 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.719
 as well as you can see bigger and then 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.270
 another one more chiquitito up here already 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:19.610
 we have the three so now we would have 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.830
 to throw the glitter but as is 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.650
 As it is still fresh, we can not 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.960
 then this would be as it is when 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.819
 It is completely dry and we throw a 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.370
 little dot of glitter in the center of 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.810
 every white dot we have made is 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.909
 very important is that the 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.009
 nails are followed but very well because if 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.620
 we do not let them dry they are going to mount us 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.210
 an incredible then please the 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.099
 we let dry we do not remove it with dryer 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.749
 or anything and we already have our nails 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.849
 to go on the march to go out there 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:50.229
 and to enjoy them that is what 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.229
 what it is about and be fun
