00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.260 
maybe it's just a coincidence anyways uh
it's<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.960> back<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:05.700> teddy<00:02:06.030> bear

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's right back here on this teddy bear

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.609 
it's right back here on this teddy bear
is<00:02:06.420> actually<00:02:06.780> where<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> need<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.170> turn<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.469> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is actually where you need to turn it in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.660 
is actually where you need to turn it in
uh<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.660> first<00:02:09.840> time<00:02:10.140> actually

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
uh this was my first time actually

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.080 
uh this was my first time actually
looking<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.090> turning<00:02:12.480> point

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
looking at the turning point

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
looking at the turning point
so<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.140> was<00:02:14.410> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> looking<00:02:14.769> for<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.280> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so I was kind of looking for like a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.430 
so I was kind of looking for like a
arrow<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.510> couldn't<00:02:16.750> find<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:17.290> away

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
arrow and I couldn't find it right away

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.270 
arrow and I couldn't find it right away
and<00:02:17.739> then<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.920> realize<00:02:18.220> oh<00:02:18.370> well<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and then I realize oh well there it is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.509 
and then I realize oh well there it is
so<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.819> one's<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> hidden<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:24.099> arrows

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
so this one's kind of hidden the arrows

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.490 
so this one's kind of hidden the arrows
a<00:02:24.550> lot<00:02:24.640> smaller<00:02:25.030> than<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.450> pass<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
a lot smaller than the pass to the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.180 
a lot smaller than the pass to the
