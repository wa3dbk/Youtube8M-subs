at<00:01:16.920> least<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.250> I've<00:01:17.340> seen<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
at least that I've seen is that when you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
at least that I've seen is that when you
hook<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.420> hooks

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hook this up into your your little hooks

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
hook this up into your your little hooks
here<00:01:21.869> under<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.259> seat<00:01:22.759> obviously<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> got

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here under your seat obviously you got

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
here under your seat obviously you got
to<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.150> sure<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:25.259> seat<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to make sure your your your seat is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
to make sure your your your seat is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
level but with the blankets not all you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
level but with the blankets not all you
do<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.009> push<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.880> seat<00:01:30.119> and

the<00:01:48.810> other<00:01:48.990> side<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> seat<00:01:49.829> there's<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the other side of the seat there's a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
the other side of the seat there's a
latch<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.030> basically<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> kind

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
latch where you basically have to kind

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.490 
latch where you basically have to kind
of<00:01:52.110> gauge<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:53.090> think<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:54.780> tie<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of gauge how think you I'll tie you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
of gauge how think you I'll tie you
think<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> should<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.130> loosen<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.090> off<00:01:57.210> tighten

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
think it should be loosen it off tighten

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.149 
think it should be loosen it off tighten
it<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:58.020> put<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it up then put it back on and see if it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
it up then put it back on and see if it
works<00:01:59.369> okay<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.360> car<00:02:00.600> seat<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
works okay and this car seat just so you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.830 
works okay and this car seat just so you
know<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> safety<00:02:02.520> 1st<00:02:02.790> alpha<00:02:03.030> omega

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
know this is the safety 1st alpha omega

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.620 
know this is the safety 1st alpha omega
elite<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.759> see<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.329> don't<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.570> if

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
elite and you can see I don't know if

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
elite and you can see I don't know if
you<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.810> notice<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> video<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> huge

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you can notice in the video but a huge

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
you can notice in the video but a huge
size<00:02:08.610> difference<00:02:08.640> between<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> two<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.170> well

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
size difference between the two as well

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
size difference between the two as well
we<00:02:10.950> had<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> one<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.610> our<00:02:11.700> Passat<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.660> a

we had this one in our Passat which is a
mid

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
mid

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.840 
mid
nice<00:02:13.390> car<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:14.980> borderline<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.640> bag

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
nice car and it was borderline to bag

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.210 
nice car and it was borderline to bag
it's<00:02:16.120> got<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.930> whole<00:02:17.170> space<00:02:17.530> basically

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it's got like the whole space basically

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.520 
it's got like the whole space basically
in<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.550> van<00:02:18.760> now<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.140> thing<00:02:20.290> about

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
in a van now and that's the thing about

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.560 
in a van now and that's the thing about
this<00:02:20.740> one<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.220> funny<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.880> 50<00:02:22.150> bucks<00:02:22.180> more

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
this one it's so funny for 50 bucks more

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.990 
this one it's so funny for 50 bucks more
you<00:02:22.630> get<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.870> seat<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.650> design<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.760> much

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you get a seat that is design so much

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.700 
you get a seat that is design so much
better<00:02:25.270> everything<00:02:25.780> every<00:02:26.320> single<00:02:26.530> thing

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
better everything every single thing

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.220 
better everything every single thing
about<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.400> better<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.720> only<00:02:28.870> 50

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
about it is better and it's only 50

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.220 
about it is better and it's only 50
bucks<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.430> say<00:02:31.120> spend<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.870> money<00:02:32.050> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
bucks more so I say spend the money and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.870 
bucks more so I say spend the money and
save<00:02:32.590> yourself<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> aggravation<00:02:33.040> there

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
save yourself the aggravation there

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880 
save yourself the aggravation there
really<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> think<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.570> 50<00:02:34.870> I'm<00:02:35.110> somewhere

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
really I think it was 50 I'm somewhere

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.060 
really I think it was 50 I'm somewhere
in<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.730> ballpark<00:02:37.000> range<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:38.290> yeah<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:39.040> a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
in that ballpark range but yeah not a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.060 
in that ballpark range but yeah not a
huge<00:02:39.460> difference<00:02:39.850> between<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.360> two<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.660> price

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
huge difference between the two in price

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.530 
huge difference between the two in price
and<00:02:42.070> then<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.370> other<00:02:42.490> one<00:02:42.700> what<00:02:43.300> about<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and then the other one what about the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.050 
and then the other one what about the
straps<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.070> basic<00:02:45.280> strap<00:02:45.820> set

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
straps so this is just a basic strap set

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.520 
straps so this is just a basic strap set
up<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.330> believe<00:02:46.480> well<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.380> your

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
up I believe well this is like your

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.350 
up I believe well this is like your
typical<00:02:47.830> strap<00:02:48.370> setup<00:02:48.730> whereas<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.240> have

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
typical strap setup whereas if you have

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000 
typical strap setup whereas if you have
to<00:02:49.510> change<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.990> well<00:02:50.140> actually<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.710> did<00:02:50.890> do

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
to change that well actually they did do

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.140 
to change that well actually they did do
a<00:02:51.040> good<00:02:51.250> job<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:51.820> where<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.060> just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
a good job on this one where you just

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.240 
a good job on this one where you just
pull<00:02:52.600> these<00:02:52.780> latches<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.680> lift<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.010> up<00:02:54.130> so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
pull these latches and you lift it up so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
pull these latches and you lift it up so
that<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:55.030> good<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.540> least<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.110> other

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
that that's good at least on the other

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.170 
that that's good at least on the other
one<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:57.070> even<00:02:57.400> easier<00:02:57.730> than<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.000> you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
one it's even easier than that you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.850 
one it's even easier than that you
literally<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.660> lift<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.050> up<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.380> pull<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> tab

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
literally just lift it up and pull a tab

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.370 
literally just lift it up and pull a tab
in<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.520> move<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.030> down<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
in it you can move it up and down so

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.030 
in it you can move it up and down so
that's<00:03:02.560> actually<00:03:03.100> not<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:03.520> bad<00:03:03.990> but<00:03:04.990> there<00:03:05.920> is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
that's actually not so bad but there is

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
that's actually not so bad but there is
a<00:03:06.070> difference<00:03:06.580> between<00:03:06.670> making<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
a difference between making it the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.470 
a difference between making it the
design<00:03:08.080> at<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.980> boat<00:03:09.160> recline<00:03:09.610> as<00:03:09.940> well<00:03:10.150> and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
design at the boat recline as well and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.390 
design at the boat recline as well and
any<00:03:11.260> differences<00:03:11.740> with<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.100> way<00:03:12.220> they

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
any differences with the way they

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.250 
any differences with the way they
require<00:03:12.730> well<00:03:12.940> yeah<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.540> one's<00:03:13.750> again

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
require well yeah like this one's again

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.449 
require well yeah like this one's again
the<00:03:14.470> design<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:16.110> kind<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.530> don't<00:03:18.370> know

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
the design is more kind of I don't know

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.460 
the design is more kind of I don't know
like<00:03:18.670> yeah<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:19.900> very<00:03:19.959> kind<00:03:20.350> of

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
like yeah it's a it's very kind of

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.220 
like yeah it's a it's very kind of
clunky<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.700> when<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.970> retire<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.660> recline<00:03:23.050> it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
clunky so when you retire you recline it

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.470 
clunky so when you retire you recline it
you<00:03:23.380> really<00:03:23.920> increase<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> space<00:03:24.700> like<00:03:24.910> this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
you really increase the space like this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.440 
you really increase the space like this
is<00:03:25.660> an<00:03:25.810> afford<00:03:26.140> Winstar<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.940> thank<00:03:27.940> god<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.300> is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
is an afford Winstar and thank god it is

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.630 
is an afford Winstar and thank god it is
like<00:03:28.660> we'd<00:03:28.810> like<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.080> legacy<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.650> reclined

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
like we'd like it legacy this reclined

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.170 
like we'd like it legacy this reclined
this<00:03:30.970> wasn't<00:03:31.360> going<00:03:31.570> into<00:03:31.720> posad<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:33.030> they<00:03:34.030> are

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
this wasn't going into posad so they are

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.580 
this wasn't going into posad so they are
without<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.780> know<00:03:34.870> we'd<00:03:35.020> have<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.320> have<00:03:35.350> a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
yeah that's that's that that's it so we

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.199 
yeah that's that's that that's it so we
went<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:43.989> video<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.410> let<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.430> hopefully

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
went to this video to let you hopefully

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.910 
went to this video to let you hopefully
watch<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.690> before<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.080> end<00:03:47.200> up<00:03:47.350> purchasing

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
watch this before you end up purchasing

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.590 
watch this before you end up purchasing
one<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.250> these<00:03:48.459> seats<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.150> say<00:03:49.270> it's<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> bad

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
one of these seats not to say it's a bad

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.830 
one of these seats not to say it's a bad
seat<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.500> safety<00:03:51.100> 1st<00:03:51.310> alpha<00:03:51.580> omega<00:03:51.850> but

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
seat the safety 1st alpha omega but

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.050 
seat the safety 1st alpha omega but
definitely<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.830> size<00:03:54.040> difference<00:03:54.550> is<00:03:54.820> huge

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
definitely the size difference is huge

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.990 
definitely the size difference is huge
so<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.570> we<00:03:55.690> had<00:03:55.780> only<00:03:55.959> bought<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.000> we

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
so if we had only bought this one and we

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.250 
so if we had only bought this one and we
just<00:03:58.239> would<00:03:58.360> have<00:03:58.480> been<00:03:58.600> very<00:03:58.750> unhappy<00:03:58.959> right

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
just would have been very unhappy right

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.620 
just would have been very unhappy right
if<00:03:59.830> we<00:03:59.980> only<00:04:00.100> had<00:04:00.250> one<00:04:00.280> car<00:04:00.459> we'd<00:04:01.270> have<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.510> make

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
if we only had one car we'd have to make

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.449 
if we only had one car we'd have to make
it<00:04:01.780> work<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.260> mid-sized<00:04:02.680> car<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.340> was

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459
