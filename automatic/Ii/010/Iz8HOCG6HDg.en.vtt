highly suggest for this game don't make
a<00:00:49.050> DJ<00:00:49.379> map<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.329> need<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> we

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
a DJ map because we don't need it we

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.369 
a DJ map because we don't need it we
have<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.980> perfect<00:00:53.370> d-day<00:00:54.120> map<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.199> da

have the perfect d-day map which is da

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
have the perfect d-day map which is da
designated<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.309> better<00:00:56.460> crisis<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
designated is all better crisis it is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.119 
designated is all better crisis it is
perfect<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> number<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.379> units<00:01:01.800> exceeds<00:01:03.110> XL

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
perfect the number of units exceeds XL

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
perfect the number of units exceeds XL
greatly<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> wouldn't<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.840> able<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> add

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
greatly so you wouldn't be able to add

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
greatly so you wouldn't be able to add
anything<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.770> by<00:01:08.070> adding<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.490> units<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
anything more by adding more units it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.160 
anything more by adding more units it
has<00:01:10.909> objective<00:01:11.909> based<00:01:12.119> gameplay<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
has objective based gameplay which is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
has objective based gameplay which is
really<00:01:13.380> cool<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:14.369> has<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:15.200> building

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
really cool which has a very building

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
really cool which has a very building
structure<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.189> first<00:01:17.520> find<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> beach

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
structure where you first find the beach

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
structure where you first find the beach
and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.509> actually<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.020> trenches<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and then actually on the trenches as you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
and then actually on the trenches as you
can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.560> old

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
can see this one only has to be old

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
can see this one only has to be old
usable<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> fucking<00:01:23.909> ugly<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:26.090> guess<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.450> only

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
usable the fucking ugly I guess the only

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.800 
usable the fucking ugly I guess the only
good<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:27.900> about<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:29.240> because<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.509> don't

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
good thing about this because I don't

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.530 
good thing about this because I don't
remember<00:01:31.040> okay<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.970> remember<00:01:33.150> how

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
remember okay that I don't remember how

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
remember okay that I don't remember how
many<00:01:33.570> turrets<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.439> bunkers<00:01:34.890> had<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
many turrets the bunkers had in the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.280 
many turrets the bunkers had in the
first<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:37.110> better<00:01:37.380> prices<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:40.020> least

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
first in all better prices but at least

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.889 
first in all better prices but at least
I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.829> each<00:01:41.280> bunker<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.329> which

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I think each bunker here is for which

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
I think each bunker here is for which
means<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.649> indeed<00:01:43.890> hold<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:45.030> all

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
means that if you indeed hold on to all

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.840 
means that if you indeed hold on to all
those<00:01:45.540> turrets<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:46.950> major

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
those turrets you can actually major

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.719 
those turrets you can actually major
damage<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.049> always<00:01:49.229> important<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
damage it is always important see the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.389 
damage it is always important see the
d-day<00:01:51.060> map<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.079> balanced<00:01:52.500> map<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.009> not

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
d-day map is not a balanced map it's not

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.929 
d-day map is not a balanced map it's not
meant<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:56.070> sure<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939

it's<00:03:40.250> pretty<00:03:40.459> cool<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.880> have<00:03:40.970> turrets

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
it's pretty cool that they have turrets

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.600 
it's pretty cool that they have turrets
also<00:03:41.660> over<00:03:41.930> there<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.860> they<00:03:43.010> can<00:03:43.040> also<00:03:43.310> attack

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
also over there so they can also attack

a beach in terms of turrets this map is

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.550 
a beach in terms of turrets this map is
doing<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> very<00:03:47.030> good<00:03:47.150> job<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.750> as<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.080> defending

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
doing a very good job and as a defending

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.160 
doing a very good job and as a defending
side<00:03:48.739> would<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:49.310> cool<00:03:49.520> i<00:03:52.390> guess<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.870> map<00:03:54.140> is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
side would be cool i guess this map is

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.930 
side would be cool i guess this map is
still<00:03:54.590> worth<00:03:54.800> checking<00:03:55.160> out<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:55.790> other

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
very cool i was actually thinking maybe

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.640 
very cool i was actually thinking maybe
i<00:05:12.610> should<00:05:12.849> do<00:05:12.970> like<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> top<00:05:13.509> 10<00:05:13.840> top<00:05:14.349> 10<00:05:14.410> is

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
i should do like a top 10 top 10 is

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.839 
i should do like a top 10 top 10 is
probably<00:05:14.949> difficult<00:05:15.250> because<00:05:15.520> i<00:05:15.669> couldn't

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
probably difficult because i couldn't

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
well probably i would be able to find 10

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
like and it doesn't necessarily have to

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.490 
like and it doesn't necessarily have to
be<00:05:41.500> Normandy<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:43.330> could<00:05:43.509> also<00:05:43.659> be<00:05:43.810> i<00:05:44.139> mean<00:05:44.169> in

the<00:05:44.860> Pacific<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.460> know<00:05:45.580> there<00:05:45.820> were<00:05:45.909> a<00:05:45.940> lot

the Pacific you know there were a lot
lots<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:46.840> details<00:05:47.139> because<00:05:47.380> they<00:05:48.039> they<00:05:48.250> would

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
lots of details because they they would

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.450 
lots of details because they they would
always<00:05:48.550> fight<00:05:49.000> on<00:05:49.409> Islands<00:05:50.409> so<00:05:50.979> they<00:05:51.190> had<00:05:51.340> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
always fight on Islands so they had to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.730 
always fight on Islands so they had to
reach<00:05:51.580> that<00:05:51.789> with<00:05:52.000> landing<00:05:52.300> craft<00:05:52.740> so

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
reach that with landing craft so

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.360 
reach that with landing craft so
something<00:05:54.070> like<00:05:54.099> rising<00:05:54.460> storm<00:05:54.940> could<00:05:55.240> also

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
something like rising storm could also

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.820 
something like rising storm could also
offer<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:58.120> experience<00:05:58.719> with<00:05:59.050> the<00:05:59.259> UO<00:05:59.409> Jima

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
offer that experience with the UO Jima

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.230 
offer that experience with the UO Jima
map<00:06:00.039> for<00:06:00.340> example

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.659 

anyway<00:06:04.319> so<00:06:05.319> yeah<00:06:05.469> it's<00:06:05.860> unfortunate<00:06:06.639> that

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
anyway so yeah it's unfortunate that

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.529 
anyway so yeah it's unfortunate that
this<00:06:06.909> this<00:06:07.629> map<00:06:08.169> has<00:06:08.439> to<00:06:08.740> weigh<00:06:09.370> up<00:06:09.520> until<00:06:09.849> onto

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
this this map has to weigh up until onto

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.619 
this this map has to weigh up until onto
that<00:06:10.719> Goliath<00:06:11.289> map<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:11.949> a<00:06:12.009> decimated<00:06:12.400> days<00:06:12.699> so

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:13.629 
that Goliath map of a decimated days so

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.570 
that Goliath map of a decimated days so
for<00:06:14.050> me<00:06:14.139> it's<00:06:14.259> not<00:06:14.289> really<00:06:14.590> recommended<00:06:14.830> still

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
for me it's not really recommended still
