underneath<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> weight<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
underneath the weight so there's a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
underneath the weight so there's a
straight<00:01:16.380> line<00:01:16.650> between<00:01:16.979> his<00:01:17.250> shoulders<00:01:17.670> he's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
straight line between his shoulders he's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.120

slowly<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.880> pair<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.990> bit

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
slowly and pair it up a little bit

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
slowly and pair it up a little bit
harder<00:01:22.470> each<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.310> that'll<00:01:23.610> come<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
harder each time and that'll come in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.830 
harder each time and that'll come in
handy<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.270> you've<00:01:24.420> got<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> heavier

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
handy when you've got the heavier

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.630 
handy when you've got the heavier
weights<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.280> drive<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
weights on because you really drive it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.859 
weights on because you really drive it
up<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:26.939> force<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> develop<00:01:27.720> some

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
up with some force and develop some

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.800 
up with some force and develop some
explosive<00:01:28.500> power<00:01:29.119> which<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.299> help<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.780> your

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
explosive power which will help in your

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
explosive power which will help in your
overall<00:01:31.170> development<00:01:31.549> our<00:01:32.549> next<00:01:32.880> chest

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
exercise and in my opinion the most

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
exercise and in my opinion the most
important<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.270> dumbbell<00:01:36.990> flyes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
important one of all is dumbbell flyes

about<00:01:48.930> his<00:01:49.200> movement<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> show<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
about his movement I'm going to show you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.100 
about his movement I'm going to show you
a<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:50.850> trick<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.149> he<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.930> make

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a little trick as he does them to make

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
a little trick as he does them to make
them<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.829> even<00:01:53.100> harder

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
them make them even harder

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
them make them even harder
we<00:01:53.970> often<00:01:54.119> say<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.600> muscle<00:01:54.960> TV<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.500> look<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
we often say on muscle TV don't look to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
we often say on muscle TV don't look to
make<00:01:55.920> an<00:01:56.040> exercise<00:01:56.250> easier<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> make<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
make an exercise easier look to make it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
make an exercise easier look to make it
harder<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.680> he's<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> nice<00:01:59.219> straight<00:01:59.520> line

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
harder now he's got a nice straight line

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.889 
harder now he's got a nice straight line
between<00:01:59.880> his<00:02:00.090> wrists<00:02:00.329> elbows<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> shoulders

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
between his wrists elbows and shoulders

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.499 
between his wrists elbows and shoulders
we<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:02.790> part<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
we know that that's a hard part and then

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
we know that that's a hard part and then
it's<00:02:03.750> easy<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.409> towards<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> top<00:02:05.070> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it's easy as you get towards the top so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.609 
it's easy as you get towards the top so
have<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.790> training<00:02:06.149> partner<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.780> half

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
have your training partner do this half

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.590 
have your training partner do this half
way<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:08.039> grab<00:02:08.819> his<00:02:09.000> hands<00:02:09.450> make<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.989> hard

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
way up grab his hands make it hard

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.720 
way up grab his hands make it hard
get<00:02:10.690> hard<00:02:10.900> make<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.530> hard<00:02:11.950> okay<00:02:12.280> back<00:02:12.490> we'll<00:02:12.640> go

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
get hard make it hard okay back we'll go

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.710 
get hard make it hard okay back we'll go
we'll<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.120> more<00:02:13.270> like<00:02:13.480> that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
we'll do one more like that

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.680 
we'll do one more like that
this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.530> forcing<00:02:14.980> hands<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.430> flex<00:02:15.700> what<00:02:16.450> would

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
this is forcing hands to flex what would

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.870 
this is forcing hands to flex what would
be<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.350> easier<00:02:17.740> part<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> movement<00:02:18.460> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
be the easier part of the movement and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.240 
be the easier part of the movement and
that'll<00:02:19.360> ensure<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.380> get<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.710> full<00:02:21.010> range

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that'll ensure that you get a full range

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.300 
that'll ensure that you get a full range
of<00:02:21.490> motion<00:02:21.670> build<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> whole<00:02:22.810> chest<00:02:23.140> up

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
of motion build the whole chest up

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.740 
of motion build the whole chest up
another<00:02:24.310> very<00:02:24.550> important<00:02:25.000> exercise<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.720> a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
another very important exercise is a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320 
another very important exercise is a
cable<00:02:26.230> fly<00:02:26.440> machine<00:02:26.830> or<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> picnic<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:28.180> we

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
cable fly machine or a picnic the way we

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.760 
cable fly machine or a picnic the way we
do<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.810> little<00:02:29.080> bit<00:02:29.170> unique<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.560> try

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
do this is a little bit unique we try

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.380 
do this is a little bit unique we try
and<00:02:29.890> mimic<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.280> dumbbell<00:02:30.640> fly<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.150> because

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
and mimic the dumbbell fly but because

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and mimic the dumbbell fly but because
we're<00:02:31.540> sitting<00:02:31.720> straight<00:02:31.990> up

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
we're sitting straight up
