so<00:00:24.680> there<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.980> camera<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.820> lined<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
so there my camera is lined up with the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
so there my camera is lined up with the
white<00:00:28.560> line<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> body<00:00:31.279> with<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> TV<00:00:32.820> on

the<00:00:33.750> mode<00:00:34.500> dial<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> shutter

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the mode dial so I'm now in a shutter

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
the mode dial so I'm now in a shutter
priority<00:00:37.520> mode<00:00:39.680> what<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
priority mode what I can do now is is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
priority mode what I can do now is is
manually<00:00:42.360> set<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> control<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> shutter

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
manually set and control the shutter

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
manually set and control the shutter
prior<00:00:44.390> setting<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.219> aperture<00:00:47.700> will

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
prior setting but the aperture will

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.959 
prior setting but the aperture will
automatically<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.920> be<00:00:49.920> set<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.399> compensate

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
automatically be be set to compensate

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.290 
automatically be be set to compensate
for<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.539> shutter<00:00:51.809> setting<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.760> if<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.910> hold<00:00:54.120> down

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
for my shutter setting so if I hold down

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.610 
for my shutter setting so if I hold down
the<00:00:54.750> shutter<00:00:55.110> button<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:56.930> can<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> main

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the shutter button I can use the main

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
the shutter button I can use the main
control<00:00:59.100> dial<00:00:59.539> to<00:01:00.890> increase<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.129> decrease<00:01:03.140> my

control dial to increase or decrease my
shutter<00:01:04.769> settings<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.580> I'm

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
shutter settings so right now I'm

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.200 
shutter settings so right now I'm
increasing<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.180> way

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
increasing it and I can go all the way

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.830 
increasing it and I can go all the way
to<00:01:09.439> four<00:01:10.439> thousand<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.970> four<00:01:12.240> thousandth<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to four thousand one four thousandth of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
to four thousand one four thousandth of
a<00:01:13.080> second<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.060> now

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
a second now you can see that right now

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.070 
a second now you can see that right now
my<00:01:16.159> aperture<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.400> blinking<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.180> means<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.510 

that's<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.670> enough<00:01:24.030> light<00:01:25.520> even

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that's going to be not enough light even

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
that's going to be not enough light even
at<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> even<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> widest<00:01:28.049> aperture<00:01:28.460> one

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
at the even at the widest aperture one

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
at the even at the widest aperture one
four<00:01:29.670> thousandth<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.299> second<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.720> really

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
four thousandth of a second is really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
four thousandth of a second is really
really<00:01:31.259> fast<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> need<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> scroll<00:01:33.299> back

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
really fast so I need to scroll back

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.710 
really fast so I need to scroll back
down<00:01:34.009> oops<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.180> scroll<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:36.689> down

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
down oops I need to scroll back down

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.399 
down oops I need to scroll back down
here<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> find<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.630> shutter<00:01:39.630> speed<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> will

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
here to find a shutter speed that will

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.819 
here to find a shutter speed that will
work<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.180> aperture<00:01:42.659> stops<00:01:43.500> blinking

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
work now the the aperture stops blinking

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.660 
work now the the aperture stops blinking
at<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:45.290> twelve<00:01:46.290> hundred<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.890> fiftieth<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
at one twelve hundred and fiftieth of a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
at one twelve hundred and fiftieth of a
second<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.070> looks<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.060> give

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
second and it looks like that will give

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050 
second and it looks like that will give
me<00:01:51.390> an<00:01:51.600> appropriate<00:01:52.140> exposure<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
me an appropriate exposure if I if I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.310 
me an appropriate exposure if I if I
wanted<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> scroll<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.259> other<00:01:55.290> way

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
wanted to scroll back down the other way

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.100 
wanted to scroll back down the other way
towards<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.649> bulb<00:01:58.950> setting<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.079> far

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
towards the bulb setting I can go so far

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
towards the bulb setting I can go so far
as<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.960> let's<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:07.009> it's<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.160> thirty

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
as to let's see here it's like thirty

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.719 
as to let's see here it's like thirty
seconds

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
seconds

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.990 
seconds
thirty<00:02:11.450> seconds<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.080> longest<00:02:13.000> shutter

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
thirty seconds is the longest shutter

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.820 
thirty seconds is the longest shutter
speed<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.600> can<00:02:14.690> manually<00:02:15.530> program<00:02:16.220> without

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
speed I can manually program without

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.490 
speed I can manually program without
putting<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.010> camera<00:02:19.310> into<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> bulb<00:02:20.000> mode<00:02:20.500> but

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
putting the camera into a bulb mode but

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.030 
putting the camera into a bulb mode but
you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.740> see<00:02:21.980> again<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:23.650> aperture<00:02:24.650> is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you can see again that the aperture is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.460 
you can see again that the aperture is
blinking<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.240> camera<00:02:26.630> letting<00:02:27.320> me<00:02:27.440> know

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
blinking on the camera letting me know

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.900 
blinking on the camera letting me know
that<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:31.220> exposure<00:02:31.730> with<00:02:32.630> 30<00:02:32.870> seconds<00:02:33.910> will

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that the exposure with 30 seconds will

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.870 
that the exposure with 30 seconds will
be<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.480> too<00:02:35.540> much<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.590> picture<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.700> this

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
be way too much the the picture in this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.490 
be way too much the the picture in this
case<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.270> just<00:02:38.480> gonna<00:02:38.630> be<00:02:38.750> totally<00:02:38.930> blown<00:02:39.290> out

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500

scroll back the other way
slow<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:44.060> let's<00:02:44.510> speed<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.650> shutter

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
slow it down let's speed up the shutter

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.630 
slow it down let's speed up the shutter
speed<00:02:46.070> here<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> little<00:02:46.640> bit<00:02:46.820> until<00:02:48.640> two

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
speed here a little bit until two

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.640 
speed here a little bit until two
seconds<00:02:50.530> two<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.680> half<00:02:51.800> seconds<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.500> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
seconds two and a half seconds and it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.340 
seconds two and a half seconds and it
looks<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:54.890> at<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.910> smallest<00:02:56.900> aperture

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
looks like at the smallest aperture

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.870 
looks like at the smallest aperture
two-and-a-half<00:02:57.920> seconds<00:02:58.250> will<00:02:58.400> give<00:02:58.519> me<00:02:58.670> an

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
two-and-a-half seconds will give me an

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.660 
two-and-a-half seconds will give me an
appropriate<00:02:59.540> exposure<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> again<00:03:03.670> shutter

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
appropriate exposure so again shutter

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.699 
appropriate exposure so again shutter
priority<00:03:04.850> mode<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.690> mainly<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.500> give<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
priority mode is mainly to give you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.350 
priority mode is mainly to give you
control<00:03:06.980> over<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.550> sharpness<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.209> your

control over the sharpness of your

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
control over the sharpness of your
picture<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:09.310> faster<00:03:10.310> shutter<00:03:10.489> speed<00:03:10.850> will<00:03:11.030> give

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
picture a faster shutter speed will give

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.790 
picture a faster shutter speed will give
you<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.300> sharper<00:03:11.690> image<00:03:11.720> as<00:03:12.140> slower<00:03:12.500> shutter

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
you a sharper image as slower shutter

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.340 
you a sharper image as slower shutter
speed<00:03:13.340> will<00:03:13.940> give<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.870> sense<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
speed will give you the sense of

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.400 
speed will give you the sense of
movement<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.799> sense<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.040> action<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.410> take

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
movement the sense of action so take

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.660 
movement the sense of action so take
some<00:03:18.590> time<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.860> mess<00:03:18.980> around<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.519> get

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
some time to mess around with it and get

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.799 
some time to mess around with it and get
some<00:03:19.910> experience<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.590> creative
