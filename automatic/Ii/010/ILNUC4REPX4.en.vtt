would<00:02:24.030> imagine<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.720> stage<00:02:25.110> we're

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
would imagine at this stage we're

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.160 
would imagine at this stage we're
hearing<00:02:25.620> from<00:02:26.580> Vietnam<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.330> they<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:28.110> they

Sea because as I said earlier they this
is<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.579> strong<00:03:02.850> indication<00:03:03.209> at<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.450> stage

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
is a strong indication at this stage

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.110 
is a strong indication at this stage
that<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.829> plate<00:03:05.100> might<00:03:05.670> have<00:03:05.820> have

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
that the the plate might have have

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.990 
that the the plate might have have
crashed<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.019> South<00:03:07.440> China<00:03:07.470> Sea<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.610> these
