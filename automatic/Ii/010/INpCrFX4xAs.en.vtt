00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
on this one but i think when i reviewed

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
on this one but i think when i reviewed
it<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.710> mentioned<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> switch<00:00:32.969> 11<00:00:33.420> would

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it i mentioned that the switch 11 would

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 
it i mentioned that the switch 11 would
be<00:00:33.930> quite<00:00:34.170> nice<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.370> would

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
be quite nice because it actually would

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
be quite nice because it actually would
address<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.390> little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.170> terms<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
address a little bit more in terms of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
address a little bit more in terms of
productivity<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> larger<00:00:38.730> screen<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
productivity with a larger screen and a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
productivity with a larger screen and a
bigger<00:00:40.020> keyboard<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.040> bigger

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
bigger keyboard and a bit of a bigger

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.470 
bigger keyboard and a bit of a bigger
battery<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:41.910> exactly<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.360> we've

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
battery and that's exactly what we've

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.110 
battery and that's exactly what we've
got<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> acer<00:00:43.350> switch<00:00:44.100> 11<00:00:44.850> there's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
got here is the acer switch 11 there's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
got here is the acer switch 11 there's
two<00:00:45.239> version<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:46.260> versions<00:00:46.649> there's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
two version of this two versions there's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.720 
two version of this two versions there's
a<00:00:46.860> 15<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.579> which<00:00:47.789> has<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> bay<00:00:48.690> trail-t

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
a 15 one which has got the bay trail-t

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.010 
a 15 one which has got the bay trail-t
inside<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> version<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
inside and then there's a version of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.340 
inside and then there's a version of
this<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.410> core<00:00:54.230> i3<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.320> i5<00:00:55.770> i<00:00:56.129> believe<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
this with core i3 and i5 i believe in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
this with core i3 and i5 i believe in
it's<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> same<00:00:58.680> 1366<00:00:59.430> x<00:00:59.640> 768<00:01:00.300> screen<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's got the same 1366 x 768 screen it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.219 
it's got the same 1366 x 768 screen it's
wide<00:01:01.289> angle<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.100> truly<00:01:02.940> IPS<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.110> my

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
wide angle but not truly IPS in my

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
wide angle but not truly IPS in my
opinion<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.519> bad<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.909> acceptable

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
opinion but it's not bad it's acceptable

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.870 
opinion but it's not bad it's acceptable
and<00:01:06.720> would<00:01:07.049> certainly<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.560> enough<00:01:07.710> for

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
and would certainly be good enough for

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
and would certainly be good enough for
video<00:01:08.880> viewing<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> keyboard<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> touch

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
video viewing the keyboard is a touch

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
video viewing the keyboard is a touch
bigger<00:01:12.600> than<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.229> switch<00:01:13.890> 11<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> same

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
bigger than the switch 11 but the same

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.609 
bigger than the switch 11 but the same
mechanics<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.350> good<00:01:16.590> news

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
mechanics which which is good news

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.570 
mechanics which which is good news
because<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.189> we'll<00:01:17.250> connect<00:01:17.549> quite<00:01:17.850> good

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
because then we'll connect quite good

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.100 
because then we'll connect quite good
thus<00:01:20.580> good<00:01:20.759> range<00:01:20.939> ports<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> side<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
thus good range ports on the side on the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
thus good range ports on the side on the
tablet<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> removable<00:01:23.250> tablet<00:01:23.640> part

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.240 
front facing which is nice and the sound
quality<00:01:54.920> should<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.070> pretty<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.850> sand

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
quality should be pretty good the sand

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.630 
quality should be pretty good the sand
on<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:58.090> switch<00:01:58.420> 11<00:01:58.810> switch<00:01:59.530> 10<00:01:59.980> rather<00:02:00.340> was

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
on the switch 11 switch 10 rather was

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.630 
on the switch 11 switch 10 rather was
quite<00:02:00.850> good<00:02:01.650> in<00:02:02.650> terms<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.070> weight<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.310> have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
quite good in terms of weight and have

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.870 
quite good in terms of weight and have
the<00:02:03.910> actual<00:02:05.130> specifications<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.250> front<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.760> me

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the actual specifications in front of me

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.390 
the actual specifications in front of me
but<00:02:08.369> 800<00:02:09.390> 850<00:02:10.390> grams<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.080> think<00:02:11.320> not<00:02:11.980> too<00:02:12.190> bad

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
but 800 850 grams I think not too bad

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.560 
but 800 850 grams I think not too bad
that's<00:02:12.550> actually<00:02:12.820> being<00:02:12.970> dragged<00:02:13.240> down<00:02:13.330> by<00:02:13.420> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
couple of cables on the right here but

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080 
couple of cables on the right here but
not<00:02:16.480> too<00:02:16.690> bad<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:16.900> an<00:02:17.110> 11.6<00:02:17.530> inch<00:02:17.980> screwing<00:02:18.970> at

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
not too bad for an 11.6 inch screwing at

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.240 
not too bad for an 11.6 inch screwing at
all<00:02:19.300> i<00:02:19.330> think<00:02:19.480> you'll<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.140> some<00:02:20.890> casual

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
all i think you'll have some some casual

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.460 
all i think you'll have some some casual
usage<00:02:21.580> about<00:02:21.760> with<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.080> certainly<00:02:23.320> not

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
usage about with that it's certainly not

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.240 
usage about with that it's certainly not
a<00:02:23.530> one-kilogram<00:02:24.459> plus<00:02:25.000> tablet<00:02:26.160> certainly<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
a one-kilogram plus tablet certainly the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.729 
a one-kilogram plus tablet certainly the
bay<00:02:27.340> trail-t<00:02:27.670> version<00:02:28.240> anyway<00:02:28.570> as<00:02:28.959> for<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
bay trail-t version anyway as for the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.160 
bay trail-t version anyway as for the
base<00:02:30.160> unit<00:02:30.459> where<00:02:30.730> i<00:02:30.760> think<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.180> one<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
base unit where i think this one is the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.240 
base unit where i think this one is the
one<00:02:32.290> without<00:02:32.530> any<00:02:32.800> any<00:02:33.610> hard<00:02:34.209> disk<00:02:34.540> or<00:02:35.250> battery

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
one without any any hard disk or battery

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.880 
one without any any hard disk or battery
inside<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:37.000> feels<00:02:37.030> quite<00:02:37.510> light<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.230> would

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
inside it feels quite light I would

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.400 
inside it feels quite light I would
imagine<00:02:39.000> I'm<00:02:40.000> not<00:02:40.300> sure<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.870> would<00:02:41.110> imagine

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
imagine I'm not sure I would imagine

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.740 
imagine I'm not sure I would imagine
that<00:02:41.860> there<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.520> be<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.940> hard<00:02:43.150> drive<00:02:43.420> option

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
that there would be a hard drive option

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.930 
that there would be a hard drive option
as<00:02:43.930> there<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> switch<00:02:44.920> 10<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.730> maybe

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
as there is on the switch 10 and maybe

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.920 
as there is on the switch 10 and maybe
an<00:02:46.420> external<00:02:46.959> battery<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:49.270> does<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
an external battery it does have the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.020 
an external battery it does have the
same<00:02:50.110> problem<00:02:50.320> as<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.709> switch<00:02:51.250> 10<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.940> if

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
same problem as the switch 10 in that if

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.850 
same problem as the switch 10 in that if
you<00:02:52.090> push<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.420> screen<00:02:52.660> back<00:02:52.810> too<00:02:53.020> far<00:02:53.050> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
you push the screen back too far the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.520 
you push the screen back too far the
tips<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.630> said<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> switch<00:02:56.200> 10<00:02:56.440> you

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
tips up as I said on the switch 10 you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.229 
tips up as I said on the switch 10 you
can<00:02:56.620> actually<00:02:56.709> open<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.070> base<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.550> just

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
can actually open that base up just

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.820 
can actually open that base up just
stick<00:02:58.420> some<00:02:58.450> putty<00:02:58.870> or<00:02:58.989> plasticine<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830
