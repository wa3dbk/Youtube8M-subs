00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.540
 the designers and designers of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 porsche are facing the challenge 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 to make a good one better 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 that 's the production of it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 popular worldwide respected porsche 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 356 to the end but the number 1 of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 porsche later becomes a legend 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.430
 which does not change that in 1964 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.430
 new model is in the starting blocks 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.410
 Well 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.890
 walter roehrl to the tax of the 911 gt3 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 his tests ensure that the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.560
 lightweight Elfer with 415 hp on and off 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.850
 the race track fast and manageable 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.980
 is the myth 911 lives when today 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.580
 Sell 911 and they want it 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 Driving a race then has to be quite a car 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 little parts are changed when they are 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.430
 any other car will take others 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.960
 marks you want to remember 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 80 percent of the parts replaced 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 So there you see how strong the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 The influence of motorsport was and is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.550
 is natural today 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.009
 retrospective 1969 bion walde guard wins 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.700
 with his Porsche 911 the Rallye Monte 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.880
 carlo 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.680
 the furious victory proves how reliable 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.300
 The sports car built for five years 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.110
 from stuttgart Zuffenhausen is 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.119
 15 years later in 1984 he creates in Metz 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.820
 the almost impossible and wins the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.140
 legendary desert rally paris-dakar 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.370

 324 times four distance 13.800 material 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.270
 murdering kilometers despite allrad this 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.930
 Hardly anyone would have won a sports car 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.630
 have expected 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.600
 the myth 911 stems from his 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.360
 everyday life reliability and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.850
 athletic characteristics of the elbe 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.549
 just like no other sports car combined 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.530
 He brings the space for the race 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:24.530
 track under a hat with the robustness 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.450
 of limousines or even suvs as 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.430
 historical racing equipment are suitable 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.799
 youngtimer from Zuffenhausen especially 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.850
 not too expensive relatively easy to clean 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.850
 and yet very fast 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.640
 Ignition key left 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.080
 just one of the typical nine 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.670
 features from 1963 to today more 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.319
 unchanged brand marks 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.480
 under the front hood sits a scarce 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.709
 but adequate for sports cars 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:01.360
 trunk at the very back of a six-cylinder 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.300
 Boxer in between two concessions two 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.069
 nottsitze the weight of the engine on the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.959
 drive shaft ensures that the new 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.989
 Elfer his power sovereign on the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.180
 asphalt brings that to or behind the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.190
 Rear axle sits as long as there is no 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.959
 has given the four wheel drive is the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.910
 hernerinnen advantageous draw from dirt 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.100
 that is quite something 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.620
 special but it was also the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.140
 something special that a car that the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.480
 or behind, one has another 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.560
 driving technique has demanded there is 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.810
 no discussion 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.530
 The car was in the hands of a client 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.319
 always superior in one's hands 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.300
 average driver her inferior because 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.150
 the car just in the border area something 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.260
 it was harder to drive than the cars 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.160
 the engine had front 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.940
 The new Elfer story begins in 1963 with 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.209
 a mistake 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.820
 the prototype travels 90 1 and celebrates 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.170
 the iaa must be world premiered in frankfurt 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.410
 but later from name-legal 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.459
 to be renamed the 911 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.910
 the first selling price 21,900 marc 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.930
 power 130 ps topspeed 210 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.930
 kilometer has drawn the 911 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.299
 the designer ferdinand alexander short fa 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.959
 porsche the timeless form is not 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.579
 coincidence 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.200
 The specifications are narrow 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:30.730
 challenge the young designer 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:32.600
 he masters the one of the specifications was 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.990
 from the beginning 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.200
 It should be the silhouette of the car for 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.410
 Everybody recognizes that it is one 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.420
 fascist and it was called a hatchback 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.870
 will of course be in a four-seated 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.690
 vehicle then the problem that the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.690
 hump therefore becomes larger accordingly 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.330
 The car is longer and I have 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.410
 always for the rear seat the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.250
 head height must be there and the higher 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.630
 I think the height is more difficult 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.630
 to make it the hatchback
