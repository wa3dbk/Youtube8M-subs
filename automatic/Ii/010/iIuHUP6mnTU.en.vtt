00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.930
 yes 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 We wanted to change the panorama a bit 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 that you saw in san fermin of t-shirts and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 it was our starting point three friends 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.930
 of which we were usually in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 We got together and decided to start 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 this adventure 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.840
 Our intentions were to make 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.899
 t-shirts make them good make them pretty 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.989
 and we went to towns that of tradition 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.840
 textile and we went door to door watching 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.270
 that they offered us and at what prices and 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 calculating with our knowledge 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.990
 who gave us the best option and to whom 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.880
 he was seen with less possibilities of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.000
 throw us 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.290
 in the first year we had the happy idea 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.350
 to make 5000 shirts 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.330
 and in addition to doing them quite late 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 stores had already made their supplies 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.020
 for San FermÃ­n they had already bought and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.990
 that we decided was after the cry of 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.210
 teasers shirts we go out to sell to the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.950
 Street 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.409
 the first store the truth that we 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.060
 we create it to experience everything 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.280
 what we did and that was not easy 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.479
 to dock in the world of stores 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.760
 multibrand that where usually 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.670
 we sell our product we do not live that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.800
 that way of distributing was very 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.920
 interesting and we started to open stores 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 own in more sites the sales in the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.630
 abroad that we do in this 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 moment they are on the one hand we have a 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 online store where we serve 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 us directly to the end customer 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.080
 On the other hand, the fact of licensing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.420
 our brand has opened many 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 doors to the international terrain that the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.380
 people understand the illustrations that 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.760
 we do even if the humor is not 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
 international and we have realized 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.440
 that in some places our our 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.700
 touches of humor because they do not understand us or 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.700
 they even misunderstand 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.200
 in our project nothing comes from a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.989
 professional form and a study of 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.260
 market everything arises from observation 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.719
 natural of the street market and the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.719
 intuition and that's how we started 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.980
 and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.860
 offers you entrepreneurs school
