00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.830
 From here we will tell you the weather news secretary 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:20.150
 Today are that it started snow or out rain in a wide East West area Wakena 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.960
 However, as a theme for today, I would like to introduce the latest view of snow after this. 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.790
 I will 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 There is a risk of snowfall in the Kanto region so let's take a closer look 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.579
 So now 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.780
 First, there is a place where snow also in Western Japan is falling because the want to take a closer look around the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 I'm sorry 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 First, in a current West of clouds 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.449
 It is a state of snow, but the place of rain is main in Kyushu, but there are reports of snow mainly in Hiroshima Prefecture 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.530
 Has arrived 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.100
 Furthermore this a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 It is the situation of snow, but spend some more time 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 It is around 3 o'clock even in Hiroshima Prefecture when I go back 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 Although it was a situation that was also rain of place 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.479
 It is the situation that it has been changed to snow at this time 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.869
 There is also a report that I intend to have more firmness. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.890
 If you look at the state of snowfall , even in the vicinity of Hiroshima City, where you will get reports about sizzling around Higashihiroshimase 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.520
 I received a report that it is piled up slightly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.159
 Like current rain clouds 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.759
 If you repeat the state of the sucker cloud, there is a low pressure centering on this south remodeling 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:37.149
 Then there are rain clouds and snow clouds spreading to the north side 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:41.540
 The peak perfume of snow and rain is seen to the extent of about combi 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:48.200
 In addition, the strength of the chill above the sky 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:54.170
 As it is, there is a risk that snow will continue until around 9 o'clock , mainly in Hiroshima Prefecture . 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:00.050
 Do such reason has been turned to snow from the rain by the course has been strengthened now But this 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.530
 Since the situation continues that it is easy to continue snowing in similar places after that, especially Hiroshima 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.670
 Coastal area where there is no 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.020
 But beware of snowfall and China Mountains and Shikoku Mountains 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.330
 Even in that area 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:16.980
 There is a place where snow is piled up and it is about 9 am after this 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.560
 As pond continues, we want to be careful about increase of snowfall 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.340
 It is next to the prefecture opposite area, but place of rain seems to become main in enlightenment area 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:32.350
 Here is where it is raining 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:36.820
 After this, even if the temperature drops a little, snow mixes in the city ​​area 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:43.660
 Rain seems to be the main thing about red 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.740
 Here also face state worse because there is also a place where snow that it is a lie snowing in along the mountain 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.850
 Please note 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.330
 Next is East Japan, but also Nagoya 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.750
 This is 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.250
 It feels like Osaka and there are likely to be more places where it will rain rather than go 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:07.900
 This is 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:12.970
 There is a possibility that the morning rain is mixed with the snow, but now it's raining, so the low pressure is also a little later 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.480
 As it approaches and the relationship between the sky becomes slightly weak, even if it snows 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.240
 We have seen in that it is not things like piles up 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 Well, it is Kanto to be useful, but it is Kanto region 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:30.830
 There is also a place where it is getting down well here 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.900
 It is a state of the present snow clouds rain clouds , but what is still hanging around that the south meeting place is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.730
 It's very weak 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.880
 Just making it many a place called snow is falling 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.880
 Current 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:50.460
 You take a look at the tree and because roughly rain and snow of the boundary line is that the yellow and green 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.930
 What a situation it is separated by it yellow and green is 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.930
 Green system 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.430
 It is this Saitama prefecture that is greenish 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.760
 The idea of ​​the fourth in the coastal area from the center of Tokyo 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:12.959
 There are more places here than snow. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.959
 There are many places in the center that are raining from within Chiba Prefecture 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:28.490
 It is the boundary of this rain and snow, but by the way the offensive is getting stronger 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 I like it inland is the temperature at the place of heaven now changes more gradually been slightly lower 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:37.410
 Especially in the morning as there is a possibility 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:42.690
 It is a runaway southern country or it is a foreign book , but it is good 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:46.880
 In areas other than this area, it may change from rain to snow 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.880
 It is still in the south meeting place of Kanto 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.440
 Like a cat 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:05:01.090
 There are a lot of perfume firm rain clouds and snow clouds, so this will heat up when you want to wear it 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:08.590
 Please be careful as there is a risk that the place of rain now will change to snow at the stage 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:15.580
 In just that this is a low pressure in the south hall will come closer to the day more and more people in the Kanto 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.540
 The situation that warm air from the south also flows into the area around Kanto when so coming 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.760
 Will be 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:25.500
 Around noon from the rain even around Kanto 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.920
 It is expected that it will change from snow to rain 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.580
 The morning is the peak of snow 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:40.980
 In particular, correct northern Kanto 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:46.340
 In the vicinity of Maebashi, the effect of warm air coming from the south of this low pressure has little effect 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:50.920
 Please be aware that it may be overdue on 1 day because it will 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:56.070
 Rain and snow are expected to be cured by night 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.070
 And although I think that I want to look at the elements of snow 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:13.570
 The element of snowfall in the Kanto region has been updated to look like this . 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:16.840
 There is a risk of snowfall on roads in the northwestern part of the city 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.550
 Around Otemachi or a coast of Tokyo 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.760
 It is along the coast of Tokyo hermitage around here 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.830
 It is expected to be a level snowfall on the grass 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:31.490
 However, the amount of snowfall is expected to increase as you go inland 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:36.620
 Approximately 2 to 5 centimeters around Saitama City 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.540
 There is a possibility that it will snow about 5 cm, so I would like to be careful 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:45.390
 And it is an update area 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:48.330
 The amount of snow is expected to increase as you go along the mountains in northern Kanto, so snow plows 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:55.200
 You may come up with things you need 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:59.650
 The road conditions will be very bad, so be sure to prepare your winter tires when driving a car 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:05.440
 I would like you to be able to drive safely and securely 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:06.040
 In the Tohoku area, there is a possibility that snow will be accumulated on the road as Erie on the northeast Pacific side 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.810
 I will 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:15.270
 Be careful of the deterioration of the road surface condition as this will be the peak of snow 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.270
 I would like you to be careful of the disturbance of transportation 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.600
 I mentioned the weather news secretary above
