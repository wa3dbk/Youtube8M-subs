00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 Well, no 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.230
 hi hello that such friends as are I 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.730
 I am alex zig zag abdomen dog 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.380
 dotcom and today I want 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.180
 talk about about 7 foods that 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.690
 They look healthy but in reality 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.690
 they are not 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.380
 that is because they sell them as 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.150
 vegetarian or vegan or because 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.280
 they disguise sugar-free foods because 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.750
 be for athletes or simply 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.640
 because they are popularly considered 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.070
 healthy these foods should we 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 stop consuming maybe sooner 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.129
 some will surprise you and I will not 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.129
 I would miss 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 12th mix of granola and fruit but 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.840
 your list of ingredients starts very 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.580
 well with walnuts fanny dried fruits very 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.530
 they commonly include peanuts with a lot of salt 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.210
 granola with excess sugar and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 unnecessary relationships like bits of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.710
 chocolate or peanut butter chips 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 for a healthier alternative woman 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.710
 when you buy these mixes are without 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.710
 salt or sugar aggregates 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 number 2 the vegan burgers do not 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.170
 all the gala burgers are 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 made the same and some of them are 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.740
 healthy alternatives to the hamburger 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 classical however the vast majority of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.910
 these meats are made with a lot 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.410
 of soy corn starch and gluten 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.600
 which reproduce the texture of the meat 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.640
 but they give you a lot of calories without 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 no nutrients if the main 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.150
 ingredient of your vegan burger does not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.450
 it's a better vegetable looking to buy another 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450
 brand 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.610
 number 3 the fat-free snacks there 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.860
 lots of healthy natural foods 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.870
 they have zero fats like fruits and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 the vegetables but worry when 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.440
 see things like cookies or ice cream 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.210
 fat-free to mention only 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.830
 Some often have the same 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.900
 amount of calories than your version that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.510
 If you have fat and are also saturated 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.800
 of sugars and sweeteners the calories and 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.810
 fats are what make you win 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.430
 weight the fat is not always the enemy 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.260
 some research is done 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.180
 current say that dairy products are 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.780
 better complete than fat-free 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780
 for giving you an example 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.509
 number 4 the potatoes ordered the most 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 of people are their popes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.860
 Baked with butter sour cream 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.930
 bacon cheese or chili a baked potato 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.239
 covered by high-fat dairy is not 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.190
 nothing healthy to finish the potatoes 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.840
 they have very high glycemic index more 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.209
 high that the table sugar and do not have 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 almost nutritional content tries 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.050
 substitute potatoes for sweet potatoes that do not 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 so much sugar in your blood and 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 They also have lots of vitamins 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.040
 number 5 drinks for after 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.650
 to do sport was always in a gatorade 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.540
 for after exercising certain then not 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.360
 Most drinks of this style 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.370
 they have around 125 calories and all 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.840
 come with refined sugar if it was a 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
 professional athlete who comes from running 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.080
 half marathon you probably need 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.819
 this sugar to recover what 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.650
 you lost but if you are a person who 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.450
 exercises normally a couple of glasses of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.450
 water will make you much better and a beats 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.069
 number 6 the energy bars some 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 energy bars are moderately 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.640
 good for your health but most 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 they are incredibly high 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.630
 sugar and calories which will end 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.910
 causing you an energetic downtime while 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.230
 after eating them remember always 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.790
 look at the list of ingredients when 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 buy an energy bar because 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.460
 You could end up eating something just like 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.040
 harmful who neither kers 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.960
 number 7 the yoghurt side this me 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.850
 It was quite surprised most 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.370
 frozen yogurts are not even yogurt 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.380
 but a sugary substitute for ice cream and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.450
 even the few who do use yogurt in their 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.280
 preparation is frequently processed 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.190
 in heat which kills the bacteria and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.390
 probiotics that give the yogurt benefit 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.240
 for a healthy and natural alternative 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 buy full Greek yogurt 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.270
 preferably naturally sweetened 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.660
 with fruits with honey and freeze it in the 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.660
 refrigerator 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.250
 always question before the things that you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.109
 sell like healthy and never forget 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.049

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.780
