00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
push the ends in so you don't see them

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.310 
push the ends in so you don't see them
there<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.840> look<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:41.190> got<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.520> arm

there you go now look you got one arm
that's<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.740> anywhere

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
that's not going anywhere

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
that's not going anywhere
it's<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.720> stiff<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.340> now

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it's as stiff as can be you can now

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
it's as stiff as can be you can now
repose<00:01:48.030> him<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.570> might<00:01:48.720> need<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.900> little<00:01:49.170> bit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
repose him you might need a little bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
repose him you might need a little bit
of<00:01:49.470> adjustment<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> make<00:01:50.880> sure<00:01:50.910> this

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of adjustment just to make sure this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.100 
of adjustment just to make sure this
tape<00:01:51.360> stays<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.900> place<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.660> you<00:01:54.720> go

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
tape stays in place but there you go

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.469 
tape stays in place but there you go
right<00:01:55.380> let's<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.369> same<00:01:56.400> on<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.240> leg

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
right let's now do the same on the leg

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
right let's now do the same on the leg
and<00:01:57.690> see<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.440> that<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.770> tighten<00:01:59.040> up

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and see if we can get that to tighten up

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 
and see if we can get that to tighten up
so<00:01:59.280> again<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.670> another<00:01:59.790> piece<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.320> PTFE<00:02:01.320> tape

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so again take another piece of PTFE tape

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.670 
so again take another piece of PTFE tape
and<00:02:01.860> wrap<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> into<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.810> joint<00:02:04.050> it's<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.500> bit

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and wrap it into the joint it's a bit

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.779 
and wrap it into the joint it's a bit
more<00:02:04.830> awkward<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> legs<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> these

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
more awkward on the legs of these

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.300 
more awkward on the legs of these
stormtroopers<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.830> quite

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
stormtroopers because the it's not quite

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.220 
stormtroopers because the it's not quite
so<00:02:08.340> easy<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:10.649> into<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.900> wrap<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
so easy to get get into just wrap the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.900 
so easy to get get into just wrap the
tape<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.100> that's<00:02:14.340> started

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
tape in right so that's that's started

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.240 
tape in right so that's that's started
take<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> longer<00:02:16.350> piece<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:16.980> keep

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
take a longer piece and just keep

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.120 
take a longer piece and just keep
wrapping<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.880> around<00:02:18.920> squeezing<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
wrapping it around squeezing it in

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.900 
wrapping it around squeezing it in
between<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.060> joint<00:02:24.530> keep<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.800> there

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.740

that<00:03:14.190> aren't<00:03:14.340> white<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.150> may<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> little

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that aren't white you may have a little

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.960 
that aren't white you may have a little
problem<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.320> tape<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.070> sort<00:03:17.910> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
problem that the tape is sort of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.240 
problem that the tape is sort of
viewable<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.290> joint<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.130> easily

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
viewable in the joint but you can easily

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.490 
viewable in the joint but you can easily
color<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.820> with<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> felt<00:03:21.269> pen<00:03:21.540> before<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.350> go

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
color it with a felt pen before you go

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.180 
color it with a felt pen before you go
wrapping<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.680> isn't<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.070> know

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
wrapping it in this isn't it you know

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.860 
wrapping it in this isn't it you know
not<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> perfect<00:03:26.880> fix<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.450> does<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> good<00:03:27.810> job

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
not a perfect fix but it does a good job

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.080 
not a perfect fix but it does a good job
and<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.410> will<00:03:28.500> make<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> figure<00:03:28.920> 2<00:03:29.459> too<00:03:29.850> floppy

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and it will make a figure 2 too floppy

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.830 
and it will make a figure 2 too floppy
to<00:03:30.420> display<00:03:30.780> back<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.920> being<00:03:32.130> displayable

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
to display back to being displayable

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.260 
to display back to being displayable
