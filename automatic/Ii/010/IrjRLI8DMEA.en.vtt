00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.699 
stuff but it's healing really well he's
got<00:02:10.970> some<00:02:11.000> still<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> redness<00:02:12.140> around<00:02:12.350> his

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
got some still like a redness around his

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.949 
got some still like a redness around his
eyes<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.910> obviously<00:02:14.330> from<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.690> big

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
eyes and all that obviously from the big

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.860 
eyes and all that obviously from the big
impact<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.700> think<00:02:17.030> he<00:02:17.239> has<00:02:17.330> got<00:02:17.510> some<00:02:17.660> cuts

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
impact and I think he has got some cuts

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.530 
impact and I think he has got some cuts
from<00:02:18.019> glass<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.560> things<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.920> too<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
from glass and things like that too and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.690 
from glass and things like that too and
his<00:02:20.540> ankle<00:02:20.989> also<00:02:21.320> we<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:21.739> hit<00:02:22.010> probably<00:02:22.459> on

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
his ankle also we think hit probably on

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.330 
his ankle also we think hit probably on
the<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.840> petals<00:02:24.170> either<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.130> clutch

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the one of the petals either the clutch

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.850 
the one of the petals either the clutch
pedal<00:02:25.700> or<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.420> brake<00:02:26.630> pedal<00:02:26.840> I'm<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.230> sure<00:02:27.440> he

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
pedal or the brake pedal I'm not sure he

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860 
pedal or the brake pedal I'm not sure he
got<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.100> pretty<00:02:28.310> good<00:02:28.459> pretty<00:02:28.850> big<00:02:29.120> gash<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.660> his

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
got a pretty good pretty big gash on his

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.140 
got a pretty good pretty big gash on his
ankle<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.319> his<00:02:31.160> ankle<00:02:31.430> bones<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.910> bruised
