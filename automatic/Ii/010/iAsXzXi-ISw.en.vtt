year<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.199> natural<00:05:14.410> body<00:05:14.710> was<00:05:14.949> just

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
year so the natural body was just

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.529 
year so the natural body was just
starting<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.340> get<00:05:15.490> recognized<00:05:15.910> more<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.389> got

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
starting to get recognized more so I got

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.600 
starting to get recognized more so I got
a<00:05:16.570> lot<00:05:16.780> of<00:05:16.810> on<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.139> line<00:05:17.349> so<00:05:17.979> there's<00:05:18.340> my

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
a lot of on the line so there's my

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.189 
a lot of on the line so there's my
strategy<00:05:19.030> why<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.270> hardest<00:05:19.690> person<00:05:19.870> said

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199
