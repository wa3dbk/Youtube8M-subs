00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.460 

the<00:00:02.879> monkey<00:00:03.270> climbing<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.899> mountain<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.410> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
the monkey climbing the mountain is a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.260 
the monkey climbing the mountain is a
simple<00:00:04.980> traditional<00:00:05.190> model<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.029> actually

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
simple traditional model it's actually

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.140 
simple traditional model it's actually
very<00:00:06.839> easy<00:00:07.140> you'll<00:00:08.099> need<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.550> pair<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.880> scissors

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
very easy you'll need a pair of scissors

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.970 
very easy you'll need a pair of scissors
so<00:00:09.570> it's<00:00:09.990> more<00:00:10.800> old-school<00:00:11.250> origami<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.980> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
so it's more old-school origami and you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
so it's more old-school origami and you
can<00:00:14.190> fold<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.670> nearly<00:00:15.030> everything<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
can fold it with nearly everything so I

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.349 
can fold it with nearly everything so I
think<00:00:16.410> smaller<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.460> thicker<00:00:17.760> paper<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
think smaller and thicker paper is a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.939 
think smaller and thicker paper is a
little<00:00:18.660> better<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> monkey<00:00:19.619> climbs

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
little better so the monkey climbs

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310 
little better so the monkey climbs
better<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.910> didn't<00:00:21.180> hit<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.539> video<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
better and I didn't hit this video to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.980 
better and I didn't hit this video to
Emma<00:00:22.529> who<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.519> recently<00:00:23.760> met<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> train<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
Emma who I recently met in a train and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.580 
Emma who I recently met in a train and
she<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.769> excited<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.820> model

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
she was really excited about this model

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.450 
she was really excited about this model
so<00:00:28.590> let's<00:00:29.400> start<00:00:30.410> if<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.859> dual<00:00:32.219> color

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so let's start if you have dual color

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
so let's start if you have dual color
paper<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.210> begin<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> white

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
paper like I do begin with the white

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.910 
paper like I do begin with the white
side<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.590> again<00:00:35.480> any<00:00:36.480> paper<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
side up again any paper will do the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.299 
side up again any paper will do the
trick<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.660> often<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.899> note<00:00:40.379> paper<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.160> put

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
trick I often use note paper we put

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.850 
trick I often use note paper we put
start<00:00:41.700> off<00:00:41.820> by<00:00:42.149> folding<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.020> half<00:00:43.079> both

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
start off by folding it in half both

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.690 
start off by folding it in half both
ways<00:00:45.379> make<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> neat<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> only

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ways make it neat because we you only

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.310 
ways make it neat because we you only
have<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> few<00:00:48.360> crazy<00:00:48.600> crazy<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> open<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> up

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
have a few crazy crazy then open it up

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
have a few crazy crazy then open it up
and<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:52.980> again<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.539> corners<00:00:59.090> post

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and do it again the corners post

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.959 
and do it again the corners post
whenever<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.840> need<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> open<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.489> turn

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
whenever you need to open it up and turn

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.130 
whenever you need to open it up and turn
it<00:01:03.059> around<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:04.909> triangle<00:01:05.909> wing<00:01:06.210> again<00:01:06.810> both

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it around now triangle wing again both

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.240 
it around now triangle wing again both
ways<00:01:08.750> align<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.049> edges<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.700> corners<00:01:12.170> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
ways align the edges and the corners and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
ways align the edges and the corners and
crease<00:01:14.250> again<00:01:14.900> very<00:01:15.900> simple<00:01:16.350> open<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.009> up

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
crease again very simple open it up

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.200 
crease again very simple open it up
rotate<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.049> do<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.409> again<00:01:28.650> sir<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.670> I'll<00:01:31.030> be

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
rotate and do it again sir and I'll be

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.929 
rotate and do it again sir and I'll be
up<00:01:31.450> again<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.990> fold<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.740> half<00:01:32.979> again<00:01:33.280> now

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
up again and fold it in half again now

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.380 
up again and fold it in half again now
what<00:01:34.330> we'll<00:01:34.509> do<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:35.640> bring<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.000> edges

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
what we'll do is bring the edges

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.410 
what we'll do is bring the edges
together<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.930> little<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.299> is

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
together a little like this and this is

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.170 
together a little like this and this is
called<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.810> preliminary<00:01:44.049> base<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.060> is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
called a preliminary base and this is

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.999 
called a preliminary base and this is
what<00:01:46.360> we'll<00:01:46.539> need<00:01:46.720> make<00:01:47.170> sure<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.740> open

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
what we'll need make sure that the open

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.779 
what we'll need make sure that the open
part<00:01:48.490> now<00:01:48.700> points<00:01:49.240> towards<00:01:49.570> yourself

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
part now points towards yourself

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.419 
part now points towards yourself
something<00:01:51.789> like<00:01:51.970> this<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:53.649> it's<00:01:53.860> time<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
something like this now it's time to

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.870 
something like this now it's time to
grab<00:01:55.119> your<00:01:55.210> scissors<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:55.929> cut<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.649> top

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
grab your scissors and cut off the top

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.570 
grab your scissors and cut off the top
like<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.509> finger<00:02:01.929> thick<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.800> little<00:02:05.580> this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
like one finger thick just a little this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460 
like one finger thick just a little this
small<00:02:06.850> piece<00:02:07.090> now<00:02:07.270> will<00:02:07.539> be<00:02:07.780> our<00:02:07.929> Mountain<00:02:08.350> key

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
small piece now will be our Mountain key

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.210 
small piece now will be our Mountain key
and<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.979> other<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.880> mount<00:02:10.799> take<00:02:11.799> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and the other one is the mount take the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
and the other one is the mount take the
mountain<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.060> fold<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.410> first<00:02:14.620> layer<00:02:14.950> up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
mountain and fold the first layer up

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.479 
mountain and fold the first layer up
like<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:17.319> mountain<00:02:17.620> top<00:02:17.830> turn<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
like this the mountain top turn it

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.750 
like this the mountain top turn it
around<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.540> same<00:02:19.569> thing<00:02:20.019> again<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
around and do the same thing again and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.819 
around and do the same thing again and
we'll<00:02:21.760> already<00:02:22.060> done<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> folding<00:02:23.200> now

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
we'll already done with the folding now

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.560 
we'll already done with the folding now
just<00:02:24.519> pick<00:02:25.030> your<00:02:25.209> monkey<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.840> put<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.040> like

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
just pick your monkey and put it in like

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.670 
just pick your monkey and put it in like
this<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.090> go<00:02:31.410> should<00:02:32.410> look<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.620> this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
this there you go should look like this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.550 
this there you go should look like this
now<00:02:36.239> also<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.660> already<00:02:38.049> looks<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
now also this already looks like a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.430 
now also this already looks like a
monkey<00:02:39.010> face<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.549> have<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.820> nose<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.510> here

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
monkey face you have the nose and here

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.970 
monkey face you have the nose and here
would<00:02:41.890> be<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> eyes<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:44.019> gets<00:02:44.410> better<00:02:44.620> as

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
would be the eyes but it gets better as

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.280 
would be the eyes but it gets better as
I<00:02:45.160> already<00:02:45.370> showed<00:02:45.579> you<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.600> monkey<00:02:47.049> can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I already showed you this monkey can
