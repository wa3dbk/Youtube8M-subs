questions that I have received when I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780

do<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.259> though<00:01:49.799> if

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
do I see that they can do even though if

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.170 
do I see that they can do even though if
they<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.189> select<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.700> exercises

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
they will select the right exercises

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
they will select the right exercises
that<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.689> 12<00:01:52.170> 13<00:01:52.680> 14<00:01:52.890> 15<00:01:53.250> repetitions<00:01:53.670> per

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that will do 12 13 14 15 repetitions per

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
that will do 12 13 14 15 repetitions per

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
set and and they do it and they tell me

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
set and and they do it and they tell me
yes<00:01:56.909> yes<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.350> I'll<00:01:58.530> do

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
yes yes I think that the more I'll do

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
yes yes I think that the more I'll do
the<00:01:58.890> better<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.340> well<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> reality

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the better it will be well the reality

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
the better it will be well the reality
is<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.380> able<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> perform<00:02:02.040> 12<00:02:02.670> 13

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
is that if you are able to perform 12 13

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
is that if you are able to perform 12 13
14<00:02:03.570> repetitions<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.680> way<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.040> simply<00:02:05.399> too

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
14 repetitions the way it is simply too

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
14 repetitions the way it is simply too
light<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.180> instead<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> working<00:02:07.049> on

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
light for you and instead of working on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.749 
light for you and instead of working on
the<00:02:07.469> strength<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> size<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> muscle

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the strength and the size of the muscle

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
the strength and the size of the muscle
you're<00:02:09.030> working<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.479> muscular<00:02:09.780> endurance<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you're working on muscular endurance and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.199 
you're working on muscular endurance and
this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.310> bad<00:02:11.550> thing<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:12.000> you're

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
this is a really bad thing if you're

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
this is a really bad thing if you're
trying<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.599> gain<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> maximum<00:02:13.020> Adamo

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
trying to gain the maximum Adamo

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
trying to gain the maximum Adamo
in<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.069> shortest<00:02:14.400> period<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.700> time<00:02:14.969> so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in the shortest period of time so

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.030 
in the shortest period of time so
instead<00:02:15.750> first<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.349> all<00:02:16.469> we<00:02:16.590> were<00:02:16.680> cheating<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
instead first of all we were cheating to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.300 
instead first of all we were cheating to
do<00:02:17.159> now<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.700> forget<00:02:18.420> about<00:02:18.450> everything<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
do now is forget about everything and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
do now is forget about everything and
first<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.489> all<00:02:20.609> discover<00:02:21.060> you'll<00:02:21.420> find<00:02:21.989> out

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
first of all discover you'll find out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.020 
first of all discover you'll find out
what<00:02:22.469> is<00:02:22.590> your<00:02:22.769> one<00:02:22.920> repetition<00:02:23.129> maximum<00:02:23.879> on

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
what is your one repetition maximum on

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.240 
what is your one repetition maximum on
specific<00:02:24.569> exercises<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.590> let's<00:02:25.799> focus<00:02:25.920> on

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
specific exercises so let's focus on

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.369 
specific exercises so let's focus on
bedrest<00:02:26.609> first<00:02:26.909> of<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:28.049> make<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
bedrest first of all so to make the

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.780 
bedrest first of all so to make the
maths<00:02:28.590> easy<00:02:28.859> let's<00:02:29.159> say<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.459> your<00:02:29.609> one

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
maths easy let's say that your one

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.170 
maths easy let's say that your one
repetition<00:02:30.030> maximum<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:31.040> 100<00:02:32.040> kilograms<00:02:32.549> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
repetition maximum is 100 kilograms so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.789 
repetition maximum is 100 kilograms so
in<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.450> case<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> would<00:02:34.049> need<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.349> work<00:02:34.379> from

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
in this case you would need to work from

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.910 
in this case you would need to work from
80<00:02:35.219> to<00:02:35.730> 85<00:02:36.150> intensity<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.989> get<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.439> maximum

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
80 to 85 intensity to get the maximum

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550 
80 to 85 intensity to get the maximum
muscle<00:02:38.219> stimulation<00:02:38.609> so<00:02:39.269> during<00:02:40.019> your<00:02:40.049> usual

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
muscle stimulation so during your usual

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.349 
muscle stimulation so during your usual
workouts<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.459> one<00:02:41.730> repetition<00:02:41.939> maximum

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
workouts if your one repetition maximum

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.379 
workouts if your one repetition maximum
is<00:02:42.870> hundred<00:02:43.349> kilograms<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:44.370> would<00:02:44.579> work<00:02:44.849> from

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
is hundred kilograms you would work from

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.710 
is hundred kilograms you would work from
75<00:02:46.169> to<00:02:46.470> 85<00:02:47.010> kilograms<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.730> by<00:02:48.120> doing<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:48.450> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
75 to 85 kilograms and by doing so you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.390 
75 to 85 kilograms and by doing so you
will<00:02:48.870> getting<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.680> maximum<00:02:49.889> muscle

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
will getting the maximum muscle

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.979 
will getting the maximum muscle
stimulation<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.419> wouldn't<00:02:51.689> be<00:02:51.780> able<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
stimulation and you wouldn't be able to

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.690 
stimulation and you wouldn't be able to
perform<00:02:52.439> that<00:02:52.530> many<00:02:52.859> amount<00:02:53.129> of<00:02:53.220> repetitions

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
perform that many amount of repetitions

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670 
perform that many amount of repetitions
you<00:02:53.849> would<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.269> three<00:02:54.659> four<00:02:55.019> five<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.439> six

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
you would do like three four five or six

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.890 
you would do like three four five or six
but<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> much<00:02:57.120> more<00:02:57.329> effective<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
but this is a much more effective and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.449 
but this is a much more effective and
efficient<00:02:58.290> way<00:02:58.409> for<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.889> increase<00:02:59.099> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
efficient way for you to increase the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.220 
efficient way for you to increase the
size<00:02:59.639> of<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.939> muscle<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.389> strengthen<00:03:01.139> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
size of the muscle and strengthen the

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.649 
guys do when trying to gain the maximum
maximum<00:03:11.159> out<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.549> muscle<00:03:11.879> on<00:03:12.030> their<00:03:12.239> chest<00:03:12.510> is

maximum out of muscle on their chest is

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.349 
maximum out of muscle on their chest is
that<00:03:13.260> they're<00:03:13.560> doing<00:03:14.040> they're<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.180> fun

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
that they're doing they're not fun

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.509 
that they're doing they're not fun
they're<00:03:15.599> doing<00:03:15.810> full-body<00:03:16.349> workouts<00:03:16.919> and<00:03:17.159> I'm

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
they're doing full-body workouts and I'm

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
they're doing full-body workouts and I'm
not<00:03:17.609> saying<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.879> full-body<00:03:18.329> workouts<00:03:18.780> are

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
not saying that full-body workouts are

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.420 
not saying that full-body workouts are
bad<00:03:19.109> but<00:03:19.349> in<00:03:19.470> my<00:03:19.590> opinion<00:03:19.979> if<00:03:20.099> you're<00:03:20.220> just

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
bad but in my opinion if you're just

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.740 
bad but in my opinion if you're just
starting<00:03:20.579> out<00:03:20.849> if<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.239> are<00:03:21.299> new<00:03:21.449> to<00:03:21.479> weight

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
starting out if you are new to weight

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.479 
starting out if you are new to weight
training<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.379> is<00:03:22.440> much<00:03:22.799> better<00:03:22.979> for<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.340> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
training it is much better for you to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.099 
training it is much better for you to
follow<00:03:23.669> your<00:03:23.849> body<00:03:24.000> split<00:03:24.329> for<00:03:24.510> Delta<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
follow your body split for Delta and

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.719 
follow your body split for Delta and
what<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.799> butter<00:03:25.949> split<00:03:26.190> workout<00:03:26.549> plan

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
what is that butter split workout plan

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.159 
what is that butter split workout plan
body<00:03:26.970> split<00:03:27.209> workout<00:03:27.569> plan<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:27.930> when<00:03:28.079> you

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
body split workout plan is when you

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.689 
body split workout plan is when you
don't<00:03:28.349> train<00:03:28.680> large<00:03:28.979> muscle<00:03:29.400> groups<00:03:29.609> like

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
don't train large muscle groups like

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.659 
don't train large muscle groups like
chest<00:03:30.470> shoulders<00:03:31.470> back<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:32.040> legs<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> same

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
day so yet again I've noticed that a lot

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.369 
day so yet again I've noticed that a lot
of<00:03:34.650> guys<00:03:34.939> this<00:03:35.939> is<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> big<00:03:36.389> big<00:03:36.599> mistake<00:03:36.629> they

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
of guys this is a big big mistake they

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.780 
of guys this is a big big mistake they
most<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.889> time<00:03:38.010> they<00:03:38.129> have<00:03:38.340> their

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
most of the time they have their

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.819 
most of the time they have their
shoulder<00:03:39.359> day<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.750> their<00:03:39.989> chest<00:03:40.229> day<00:03:40.409> that

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
shoulder day and their chest day that

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.860 
shoulder day and their chest day that
they<00:03:41.549> do<00:03:41.729> shoulders<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.269> chest<00:03:42.299> not<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.689> same

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
they do shoulders and chest not the same

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
they do shoulders and chest not the same
day<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.199> you<00:03:43.590> see<00:03:43.799> shoulder<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.759> chest

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
day and you see shoulder and chest

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
day and you see shoulder and chest
movements<00:03:45.449> are<00:03:45.540> very<00:03:45.569> similar<00:03:45.989> movements<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
movements are very similar movements and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.409 
movements are very similar movements and
basically<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.459> you'll<00:03:47.609> do<00:03:47.759> shoulders<00:03:48.150> first

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
basically if you'll do shoulders first

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.300 
basically if you'll do shoulders first
your<00:03:48.629> muscles<00:03:49.049> will<00:03:49.229> get<00:03:49.379> fatigued<00:03:49.829> elastic

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
your muscles will get fatigued elastic

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.039 
your muscles will get fatigued elastic
the<00:03:50.639> lactic<00:03:50.939> acid<00:03:51.239> will<00:03:51.389> build<00:03:51.599> up<00:03:51.720> and

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
the lactic acid will build up and

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.140 
the lactic acid will build up and
basically<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:53.009> won't<00:03:53.189> be<00:03:53.340> able<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.699> work<00:03:53.970> at

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
basically you won't be able to work at

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.149 
basically you won't be able to work at
maximum<00:03:54.359> intensity<00:03:54.959> for<00:03:55.259> your<00:03:55.379> chest<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.799> by

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
maximum intensity for your chest and by

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.249 
maximum intensity for your chest and by
doing<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.639> won't<00:03:56.909> get<00:03:57.060> bit<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.659> won't<00:03:57.930> be

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
doing so you won't get bit you won't be

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.499 
doing so you won't get bit you won't be
getting<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.709> lot<00:03:58.829> re<00:03:59.069> workouts<00:03:59.639> so<00:03:59.849> instead<00:04:00.359> you

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509 
getting a lot re workouts so instead you

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.360 
getting a lot re workouts so instead you
could<00:04:00.659> train<00:04:00.900> your<00:04:01.169> chest<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.769> triceps<00:04:02.189> on

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
could train your chest and triceps on

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670 
could train your chest and triceps on
Monday<00:04:02.759> your<00:04:03.329> legs<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.169> shoulders<00:04:04.319> on

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
workout so this we have covered some

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.520 
workout so this we have covered some
Theory<00:04:17.909> theoretical<00:04:18.780> things<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
Theory theoretical things in the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.319 
Theory theoretical things in the
previous<00:04:20.009> slides<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.459> now<00:04:20.789> let's<00:04:21.030> apply<00:04:21.150> this

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
previous slides and now let's apply this

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.029 
previous slides and now let's apply this
information<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:22.380> as<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.529> can<00:04:22.650> see<00:04:22.710> we<00:04:23.010> are

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
information so as you can see we are

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.920 
information so as you can see we are
only<00:04:23.279> doing<00:04:23.550> three<00:04:23.880> different<00:04:24.090> exercises<00:04:24.659> for

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
only doing three different exercises for

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.899 
only doing three different exercises for
our<00:04:25.050> chest<00:04:25.349> muscles<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.070> two<00:04:26.610> different

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
our chest muscles and two different

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.660 
our chest muscles and two different
exercises

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
exercises

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.060 
exercises
or<00:04:27.730> your<00:04:27.940> tricep<00:04:28.330> muscles<00:04:28.690> we're<00:04:29.110> doing<00:04:29.350> chest

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
or your tricep muscles we're doing chest

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.670 
or your tricep muscles we're doing chest
and<00:04:30.250> triceps<00:04:30.580> muscles<00:04:30.940> together<00:04:31.240> because

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and triceps muscles together because

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.960 
and triceps muscles together because
it's<00:04:32.680> very<00:04:32.800> effective<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.280> train<00:04:33.580> these<00:04:33.760> two

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
it's very effective to train these two

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.490 
it's very effective to train these two
muscle<00:04:34.270> groups<00:04:34.480> together<00:04:34.690> simply<00:04:35.170> because

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
muscle groups together simply because

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.800 
muscle groups together simply because
when<00:04:35.740> you're<00:04:35.890> doing<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.280> lot<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.760> lot<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.090> when

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
when you're doing a lot a lot of when

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.660 
when you're doing a lot a lot of when
you're<00:04:37.930> performing<00:04:38.170> chest<00:04:38.470> exercises<00:04:38.980> most

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
you're performing chest exercises most

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.640 
you're performing chest exercises most
of<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.940> time<00:04:40.120> your<00:04:40.300> tricep<00:04:40.690> muscles<00:04:41.110> muscle

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
of the time your tricep muscles muscle

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.740 
of the time your tricep muscles muscle
works<00:04:42.010> really<00:04:42.310> hard<00:04:42.640> too<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.090> it's<00:04:43.390> simply<00:04:43.690> an

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
works really hard too so it's simply an

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.690 
works really hard too so it's simply an
efficient<00:04:44.110> way<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.260> train<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.740> these<00:04:45.310> muscle

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
efficient way to train this these muscle

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.370 
efficient way to train this these muscle
groups<00:04:45.730> together<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.690> yet<00:04:46.810> again<00:04:46.930> we're

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
groups together so yet again we're

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.110 
groups together so yet again we're
starting<00:04:47.800> off<00:04:47.920> with<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.220> good<00:04:48.430> basic<00:04:48.880> flat

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
starting off with the good basic flat

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.460 
starting off with the good basic flat
barbell<00:04:49.450> bench<00:04:49.720> press<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.170> we're<00:04:50.320> doing

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
barbell bench press and we're doing

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.710 
barbell bench press and we're doing
forces<00:04:51.070> six<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.580> eight<00:04:51.640> repetitions<00:04:51.940> then

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
forces six to eight repetitions then

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.660 
forces six to eight repetitions then
we're<00:04:52.870> moving<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.710> incline<00:04:54.520> dumbbell

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
we're moving on to incline dumbbell

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.600 
we're moving on to incline dumbbell
press<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.690> like<00:04:55.870> them<00:04:56.250> actually<00:04:57.250> like<00:04:57.580> a

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
press and I like them actually like a

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.790 
press and I like them actually like a
lot<00:04:57.850> dumbbell<00:04:58.270> presses<00:04:58.510> because<00:04:58.800> dumbbell

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
lot dumbbell presses because dumbbell

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.130 
lot dumbbell presses because dumbbell
presses<00:05:00.040> make<00:05:00.760> your<00:05:00.940> stabilizing<00:05:01.540> muscles

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
presses make your stabilizing muscles

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.770 
presses make your stabilizing muscles
work<00:05:02.710> much<00:05:02.980> harder<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.550> also<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
work much harder and also on the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.270 
work much harder and also on the
negative<00:05:05.170> of<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.410> movement<00:05:05.770> when<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.070> lower

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
negative of the movement when you lower

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.770 
negative of the movement when you lower
the<00:05:06.430> weight<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.180> get<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> much<00:05:07.600> better

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
the weight you can get a much better

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.930 
the weight you can get a much better
stretch<00:05:08.140> which<00:05:08.350> allows<00:05:08.680> more<00:05:09.100> blood<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.730> flow

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
stretch which allows more blood to flow

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.240 
stretch which allows more blood to flow
into<00:05:10.180> your<00:05:10.360> muscle<00:05:10.690> group<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.320> for<00:05:11.830> England

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
into your muscle group so for England

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.160 
into your muscle group so for England
the<00:05:12.370> more<00:05:12.520> press<00:05:12.730> we<00:05:12.880> do<00:05:13.030> four<00:05:13.270> sets<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.720> yet

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
the more press we do four sets and yet

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.170 
the more press we do four sets and yet
again<00:05:14.260> six<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.740> eight<00:05:14.830> repetitions<00:05:15.010> then<00:05:15.880> for

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
again six to eight repetitions then for

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.120 
again six to eight repetitions then for
incline<00:05:16.630> dumbbell<00:05:16.780> flyes<00:05:17.170> we<00:05:17.380> do<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:17.740> three

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
incline dumbbell flyes we do see three

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.040 
incline dumbbell flyes we do see three
sets<00:05:18.400> but<00:05:18.670> 10<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.180> 12<00:05:19.480> repetitions<00:05:19.630> because

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
sets but 10 to 12 repetitions because

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.380 
sets but 10 to 12 repetitions because
throw<00:05:20.680> 12<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.250> 10<00:05:21.400> repetitions<00:05:21.580> because<00:05:22.210> this

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
throw 12 to 10 repetitions because this

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.780 
throw 12 to 10 repetitions because this
is<00:05:22.570> more<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:23.050> isolation<00:05:23.920> movement<00:05:24.250> so<00:05:24.670> and

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
is more of a isolation movement so and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.610 
is more of a isolation movement so and
then<00:05:24.970> we're<00:05:25.150> moving<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.810> school<00:05:26.200> crushers

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
then we're moving on to school crushers

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.090 
then we're moving on to school crushers
and<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.980> is<00:05:27.130> basically<00:05:28.560> triceps<00:05:29.560> extensions

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
and this is basically triceps extensions

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.010 
and this is basically triceps extensions
and<00:05:30.490> we<00:05:30.910> do<00:05:31.030> four<00:05:31.270> sets<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.600> eight<00:05:31.720> repetitions

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
and we do four sets of eight repetitions

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.320 
and we do four sets of eight repetitions
and<00:05:32.530> finally<00:05:32.950> we<00:05:33.070> do<00:05:33.190> triceps<00:05:33.640> push<00:05:33.850> down<00:05:34.060> with

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
and finally we do triceps push down with

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.380 
and finally we do triceps push down with
three<00:05:35.170> sets<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.650> twelve<00:05:36.430> repetitions<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:37.210> yet

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
three sets of twelve repetitions and yet

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.760 
three sets of twelve repetitions and yet
again<00:05:37.510> we<00:05:37.720> do<00:05:37.840> more<00:05:38.020> repetitions<00:05:38.230> because

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
again we do more repetitions because

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.190 
again we do more repetitions because
it's<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.310> more<00:05:39.820> obey<00:05:40.180> isolated<00:05:40.840> tricep

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
it's a more obey isolated tricep

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.930 
it's a more obey isolated tricep
movement<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:42.070> now<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.280> finish<00:05:42.580> off<00:05:42.820> this

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
movement so now to finish off this

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.330 
movement so now to finish off this
