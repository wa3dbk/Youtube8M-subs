that's<00:01:57.230> one<00:01:57.560> rep<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.090> every<00:01:59.480> repetition

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
that's one rep so for every repetition

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.220 
that's one rep so for every repetition
we're<00:02:01.190> really<00:02:01.460> getting<00:02:01.640> two<00:02:02.000> repetitions<00:02:02.780> in

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
we're really getting two repetitions in

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.320 
we're really getting two repetitions in
the<00:02:03.440> lower<00:02:03.590> portion<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.250> area<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:05.060> once

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
the lower portion of the area now once

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.240 
the lower portion of the area now once
you<00:02:05.480> drop<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.750> low<00:02:05.990> parallel<00:02:06.530> that's<00:02:07.010> when

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
you drop a low parallel that's when

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.800 
you drop a low parallel that's when
you're<00:02:07.400> activating<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:08.030> glute<00:02:08.210> hamstrings

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you're activating the glute hamstrings

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.650 
you're activating the glute hamstrings
high<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.040> specifically<00:02:10.760> very

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
high in so that is specifically very

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.060

in<00:03:21.570> we're<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.709> high<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.400> wide

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
in we're going very high and very wide

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
of the motion what I mean by that we're

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.000 
of the motion what I mean by that we're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to stand very slowly there you go

of the way don't lock out that keeps the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.040 
of the way don't lock out that keeps the
muscle<00:03:37.769> fibers<00:03:38.130> firing<00:03:38.690> keeps<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> nerve

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
muscle fibers firing keeps the nerve

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.130 
muscle fibers firing keeps the nerve
endings<00:03:40.470> firing<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.540> will<00:03:42.540> eventually<00:03:43.019> hit

that hole got tendon reflex threshold
for<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.420> muscle<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> shuts<00:03:46.140> down<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.890> this

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
for the muscle just shuts down so this

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.800 
for the muscle just shuts down so this
is<00:03:47.250> great<00:03:47.489> keeping<00:03:47.850> constant<00:03:48.120> tension<00:03:48.570> on

is great keeping constant tension on

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.590 
is great keeping constant tension on
there<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.380> string<00:03:49.739> client<00:03:50.220> area<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:51.030> if
