of confuse me but yet anyone else think

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
of confuse me but yet anyone else think
that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.320> maybe<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:47.059> misheard

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that I don't know maybe I just misheard

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
that I don't know maybe I just misheard
something<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.899> misread<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.500> guess<00:00:49.620> into

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
something or misread some I guess into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
something or misread some I guess into
subtitles<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.120> anyway<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.750> door<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
subtitles but anyway this door was

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
subtitles but anyway this door was
actually<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> cool<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
actually kind of cool we see this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually kind of cool we see this
persona<00:00:54.800> archetype<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.670> Larry

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
persona archetype which is what Larry

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.900 
persona archetype which is what Larry
uses<00:00:57.360> evidently<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.530> CCC<00:00:59.219> archetype<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
uses evidently and the CCC archetype I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
uses evidently and the CCC archetype I
guess<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> goes<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> different<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
guess that goes with a different I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840 
guess that goes with a different I
mentioned<00:01:01.260> demons<00:01:01.590> since<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.609> they're

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
mentioned demons since I think they're

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
mentioned demons since I think they're
supposed<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.149> brothers<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
supposed to be brothers on there so it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
supposed to be brothers on there so it
kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> makes<00:01:04.949> sense<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.339> guess<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> won't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
kind of makes sense I guess I won't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.370 
kind of makes sense I guess I won't
learn<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.659> sucked<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
learn more about sucked up to it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
learn more about sucked up to it
actually<00:01:07.650> looked<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> cool<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.670> fusions

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
actually looked kind of cool use fusions

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually looked kind of cool use fusions
maybe<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> uses<00:01:10.470> exceeds<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> synchronous

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
maybe it uses exceeds and synchronous

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
maybe it uses exceeds and synchronous
stuff<00:01:11.700> too<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:11.909> their<00:01:12.240> dimension<00:01:12.659> archetype

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
stuff too like their dimension archetype

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310 
stuff too like their dimension archetype
or<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.990> course<00:01:16.200> we

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
or or what I don't know and of course we

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.789 
or or what I don't know and of course we
got<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> aqua<00:01:16.920> actress<00:01:17.810> evidently<00:01:18.810> archetype

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
got the aqua actress evidently archetype

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
got the aqua actress evidently archetype
as<00:01:20.009> well<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:20.580> looked<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.180> interesting

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
as well which looked kind of interesting

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.690 
as well which looked kind of interesting
I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.680> know<00:01:22.799> more

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I don't know it's kind of you know more

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
I don't know it's kind of you know more
of<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.020> cartoonish<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.770> since<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
of a cartoonish kind of you know since I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
of a cartoonish kind of you know since I
guess<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> shouldn't<00:01:27.210> she's<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> younger

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
guess it is shouldn't she's the younger

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
guess it is shouldn't she's the younger
character<00:01:28.140> has<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.040> doesn't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
character has more of a it doesn't

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
character has more of a it doesn't
really<00:01:29.460> seem<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.820> strong<00:01:30.090> our<00:01:30.329> tab<00:01:30.570> maples<00:01:30.960> two

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
really seem as strong our tab maples two

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330 
really seem as strong our tab maples two
more<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> future<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.130> might<00:01:32.310> think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
more in the future now and I might think

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
more in the future now and I might think
differently<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.299> know<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.630> only<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> guess

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
differently I don't know I only I guess

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.899 
differently I don't know I only I guess
saw<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.920> three<00:01:35.130> monsters<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
saw like three monsters so for the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
saw like three monsters so for the
archetype<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.840> anyway<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
archetype in anyway it was just kind of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
archetype in anyway it was just kind of
a<00:01:38.340> basically<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.360> regular<00:01:39.750> dual<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> guess

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
a basically just regular dual I guess

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
a basically just regular dual I guess
we're<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.829> leading<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.430> seeing<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we're kind of leading up seeing this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
we're kind of leading up seeing this
character<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.360> hoping<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.930> maybe<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
character I'm hoping that maybe one of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
character I'm hoping that maybe one of
the<00:01:44.369> other<00:01:44.490> kids<00:01:44.729> finally<00:01:45.060> defeats<00:01:45.390> lay

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the other kids finally defeats lay

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
the other kids finally defeats lay
around<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.070> guess<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
around that because I don't guess you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
around that because I don't guess you
you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.240> against<00:01:48.600> him<00:01:48.689> since<00:01:48.930> he's<00:01:49.049> like

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you can go against him since he's like

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
you can go against him since he's like
in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> lower<00:01:49.950> class<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> part<00:01:51.119> of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
don't know I'm hoping that there is or

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.809 
don't know I'm hoping that there is or
at<00:02:14.769> least<00:02:14.799> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.099> future<00:02:15.400> we're<00:02:15.519> gonna<00:02:15.579> see

at least in the future we're gonna see

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.339 
at least in the future we're gonna see
more<00:02:16.329> to<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.659> and<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.900> instead<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.290> just

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
more to this and that instead of just

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.800 
more to this and that instead of just
one<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.769> whole<00:02:17.860> time<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
one the whole time and back to that you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.259 
one the whole time and back to that you
can't<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.110> some<00:02:20.260> foreshadowing<00:02:20.829> of<00:02:21.269> saw

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
can't see some foreshadowing of saw

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.839 
can't see some foreshadowing of saw
reverses<00:02:22.900> soon<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:23.950> that's<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> one<00:02:24.670> I'm

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
reverses soon so that's the one I'm

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.910 
reverses soon so that's the one I'm
really<00:02:25.090> excited<00:02:25.390> about<00:02:25.540> next<00:02:25.930> episode<00:02:26.379> no<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
really excited about next episode no I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.649 
really excited about next episode no I
want<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:27.670> sounds<00:02:27.909> awesome<00:02:28.030> but

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
want to see that that sounds awesome but

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:29.430 
want to see that that sounds awesome but
the<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:28.900> after<00:02:29.079> it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the one after it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600 
the one after it
I<00:02:29.560> guess<00:02:29.829> would<00:02:29.920> be<00:02:29.980> after<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.310> enough<00:02:30.489> this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I guess would be after have enough this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.059 
I guess would be after have enough this
give<00:02:30.790> me<00:02:30.849> trips<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.209> duel<00:02:31.420> with<00:02:31.750> my<00:02:32.440> girl<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> I

give me trips of duel with my girl and I

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.880 
give me trips of duel with my girl and I
use<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.280> or<00:02:33.519> not<00:02:33.549> but<00:02:34.349> I'm<00:02:35.349> ready<00:02:35.560> for<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> next

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.940 
series you know or one of the bad guys I
guess<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.659> or<00:02:43.930> what's<00:02:44.440> gonna<00:02:44.530> happen<00:02:44.859> on

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.720 
guess really or what's gonna happen on
there's<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.190> lot<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.400> different<00:02:45.609> theories

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
there's a lot of different theories

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.130 
there's a lot of different theories
around<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.569> really<00:02:46.690> think<00:02:46.750> he's<00:02:46.989> gonna

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
around I don't really think he's gonna

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.630 
around I don't really think he's gonna
be<00:02:47.349> for<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.950> kind<00:02:48.159> of<00:02:48.190> wonder<00:02:48.430> there's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
be for I kind of wonder there's

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.089 
be for I kind of wonder there's
something<00:02:49.000> else<00:02:49.150> going<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.709> maybe<00:02:50.709> he'll<00:02:50.920> be

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
something else going on maybe he'll be

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.379 
something else going on maybe he'll be
you<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:51.609> he<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.790> supposed<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.329> an

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
you know like he was supposed to be an

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.390 
you know like he was supposed to be an
evil<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.019> then<00:02:53.139> he<00:02:53.230> has<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.409> change<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.799> heart<00:02:53.859> I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
evil but then he has a change of heart I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.369 
evil but then he has a change of heart I
don't<00:02:54.549> know<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.760> hope<00:02:55.239> he's<00:02:55.420> not<00:02:55.450> evil<00:02:55.959> because

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
don't know I hope he's not evil because

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.629 
don't know I hope he's not evil because
I<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.859> characters<00:02:57.220> probably<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.579> my

and<00:03:13.959> if<00:03:14.019> your<00:03:14.139> animals<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.440> I'm<00:03:14.590> kind<00:03:14.739> of

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
and if your animals and I'm kind of

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.379 
and if your animals and I'm kind of
wondering<00:03:14.920> if<00:03:15.069> he<00:03:15.159> does<00:03:15.340> turn<00:03:15.579> evil<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.180> you

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
wondering if he does turn evil or you

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.819 
wondering if he does turn evil or you
know<00:03:16.480> something<00:03:16.750> does<00:03:17.019> happen<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.500> if

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
know something does happen like that if

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.920 
know something does happen like that if
maybe<00:03:18.370> he<00:03:18.549> what<00:03:18.699> do<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.849> should<00:03:19.060> alter<00:03:19.540> or

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
maybe he what do you should alter or

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.270 
maybe he what do you should alter or
something<00:03:20.349> else<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.709> guess<00:03:20.859> something<00:03:21.129> else

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
something else I guess something else

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.710 
something else I guess something else
that<00:03:21.519> could<00:03:21.639> involve<00:03:21.849> fusions<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.449> future

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
that could involve fusions in the future

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.470 
that could involve fusions in the future
too<00:03:22.870> who<00:03:23.079> knows<00:03:23.230> maybe<00:03:23.470> introverts<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.489> don't

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480

can't<00:04:33.670> wait<00:04:33.790> until<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.000> see<00:04:34.210> another<00:04:34.480> version

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720

can't wait until we see another version
of<00:04:34.900> odd-eyes<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.500> wonder<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:35.830> there's<00:04:35.980> gonna<00:04:36.100> be

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
of odd-eyes I wonder if there's gonna be

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.220 
of odd-eyes I wonder if there's gonna be
another<00:04:36.430> fusion<00:04:36.850> or<00:04:37.300> if<00:04:37.810> there's<00:04:37.990> actually

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
another fusion or if there's actually

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.720 
another fusion or if there's actually
gonna<00:04:38.320> be<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.500> synchro<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.220> they<00:04:39.280> see<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.670> and

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
gonna be a synchro and they see you and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.860 
gonna be a synchro and they see you and
all<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.880> two<00:04:40.030> cos<00:04:40.180> supposedly<00:04:40.540> there<00:04:40.690> will<00:04:40.840> be

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
all the two cos supposedly there will be

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.030 
all the two cos supposedly there will be
I<00:04:41.080> mean<00:04:41.260> that's<00:04:41.470> kind<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.680> what<00:04:41.830> we're<00:04:41.950> all

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
I mean that's kind of what we're all

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.420 
I mean that's kind of what we're all
thinking

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
thinking

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.220 
thinking
so<00:04:42.850> that's<00:04:43.030> what<00:04:43.150> I'm<00:04:43.240> most<00:04:43.270> excited<00:04:43.510> about<00:04:43.720> so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
so that's what I'm most excited about so

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.020 
so that's what I'm most excited about so
that'll<00:04:44.980> be<00:04:45.040> probably<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.370> ways<00:04:45.580> off<00:04:45.790> though

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that'll be probably a ways off though

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.280 
that'll be probably a ways off though
because<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.360> didn't<00:04:46.540> heard<00:04:46.660> anything<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.050> the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
because I didn't heard anything in the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
actual usually we hear something the car

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.850 
actual usually we hear something the car
