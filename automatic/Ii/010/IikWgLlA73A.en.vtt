00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.200
 Hi, guys, how are you?

 find them very well by the na'vi in 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.220
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.550
 Trends different options 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.160
 black dresses whether for occasions 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.860
 specials or for more occasions 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 simple as a Sunday or a day of 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 family and dinner 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.699
 etc. here I am presenting this 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 option is a super nice super dress 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.579
 comfortable super light accessories 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.839
 also calm can be color 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 silver gold color this is a dress 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.320
 especially if we are a little bit 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.239
 Weights are super comfortable for me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.780
 it's a short hand for him 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.430
 hose on the waist has an elastic 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.289
 that if you do not define the waist is not 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.210
 not tight at all and a dress very 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.960
 comfortable is a little bit above the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 super comfortable waist to get out in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 family or sundays another option that I 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.770
 I can give you is this beautiful dress is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.640
 a maxi dress if you realize it has 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.570
 a neck that has a beautiful sleeve 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.180
 at the elbows and at the waist it has 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.210
 like a double in size that starts from 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.210
 the lower part of the bust to a 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.550
 little below the waist this 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.920
 type of dress should not be worn in 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 carving has to be the measure 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.170
 perfect that is the perfect size and I do not know 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.200
 It must be not tight at all because 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.150
 then yes it will be to mark the figure of 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.369
 a way that we do not want to take in 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.250
 this case a long dress but it is not 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.560
 so long you see the shoe you see the heel 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.229
 we should never already drag the dress 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.119
 because we can have accidents then 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.920
 should always be a measure so 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.959
 completely sees the shoe 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.770
 walk very comfortable this a dress that 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.750
 it falls and it's beautiful 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:25.380
 another option that I have is this dress 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.980
 It is a beautiful lace dress is a 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 divine and is in trend right now all 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.050
 what is lace on blouses in skirts and 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 in dresses is a dress that does not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.690
 It needs a lot of adornment since the lace 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.050
 It takes all the halo the ornament in this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.570
 case sleeves logically sleeves 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.180
 transparent is also a neck in ve 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.250
 the neck favors me very much when 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.490
 We are a little bit weighed because we 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.280
 lengthens the neck and face too 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.980
 they continued to be an accessory a symptom 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.890
 a belt this either to the height 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.040
 under the bust or at the waist never 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.010
 see tighten or is it an accessory more 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.170
 makes a loop but very subtly that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.540
 drop this cloth almost always singing are 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.150
 very nice fabrics to wear 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.870
 skirts should not be skirts in carvings 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.080
 in this case it is a beautiful style skirt 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.909
 that is to say that it goes a little bit like that to the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.480
 measure of the body and from the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.760
 hip falls falls and opens then they are given 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.170
 count the height a little bit lower 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.319
 of the knee and a very elegant dress 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.349
 another option could make this precious 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.720
 dress that only has this adornment 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.110
 of lace on the bust part and the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.120
 sleeves and the other the other part of the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.860
 dress is from a regular fabric 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.950
 logically it has to be a fabric that 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.440
 fall in this case to the height of 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.260
 knees but if you notice the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.420
 dress you saw this bazaar now yes that 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.690
 worth the redundancy dresses by itself 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.819
 I do not know if you need a lot of accessories 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.420
 because with this beautiful lace in the 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.010
 part of forward taste is already 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.579
 helping to wear this dress a 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.410
 super elegant way and already with enough 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.450
 ornament between each are the sleeves are 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.090
 three quarters 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.550
 It is a very beautiful dress, very beautiful, very 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.270
 elegant and super comfortable which is what 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.270
 important 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.960
 another option would be this beautiful dress 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.760
 it's a cross dress and it's a little 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.280
 asymmetric in the front is a 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.440
 a little shorter than the back 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.750
 the front part go exactly to the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.500
 knee and the back is going to mean 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.160
 leg the sleeves are three fourths this 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.600
 it's a very, very, very special dress 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.540
 I consider it for people who 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.330
 We are a little overweight because 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.300
 it's a dress that the sleeve covers us 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.930
 arms the neck in vÃ©lez uses 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.740
 a skirt at the waist of elegance and in 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.539
 this case a fabric that falls you 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 gently figure and logically that 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.490
 not in a size that is not tight for 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.319
 nothing above all the comfort and what 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.080
 We can accompany with accessories and 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.270
 the shoes with a little super heel 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.770
 super important that the shoe has a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.069
 little touch we can say a heel 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.190
 super high but yes that has taconcito 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:30.550
 another would be this lovely dress is a 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.949
 dress the sleeve like bat style 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.650
 but it is not a long sleeve or anything is 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.740
 a sleeve like the elbows a little 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.860
 above but it's a very comfortable dress 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.539
 to carry and the main accessory is the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.840
 wearing belt in this case is like 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.260
 an elastic belt 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.730
 of 34 fingers and logically we are 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.070
 weight patients we had never 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.550
 put on the belt at the waist 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.270
 because it makes us a not very comfortable figure 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.540
 it should always be placed under the bust and 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.100
 always wear super nice heels this 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.090
 dress is a presented a dress 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.850
 beautiful beautiful daring elegant what 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.449
 more I can tell you this the neckline goes 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.770
 as a half shoulder and from there it falls with a 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.310
 three quarter sleeve 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.759
 a beautiful dress the neck with a 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:28.479
 Open-neck skirt is a skirt 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:33.190
 style that falls with this creamy fabric 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:35.289
 that these fabrics that fall beautiful is a 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.970
 super comfortable dress and they realize if 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.479
 let's go anywhere is this dress 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.550
 not only are we going to feel comfortable 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.590
 we 're going to feel elegant we're going to 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.479
 call a lot of attention is a 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.780
 dress that alone if they realize 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.759
 it is black a super elegant color in this 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.460
 case wears sedative shoes that are 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.490
 some slippers that the heel is very very 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.289
 very small but it is a heel that 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.090
 understand then we do not need it because 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.380
 are not used to tampons up 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.729
 now yes later they would be with high 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.949
 much better because you're going to see 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.150
 much more stylized but also if not 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.099
 we will be comfortable because the 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.020
 community before all chewing gum I hope that 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:13.900
 have you liked these small options 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.729
 of this little video tutorial in photos 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.949
 and we are seeing each other in the next 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:21.000
 thanks for watching the video that is very 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.000
