00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.289
 well you'll call me the iris I'm from here 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.289
 Guadalajara Jalisco 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.919
 I'm going to run next April 6 here 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.109
 in the metropolitan park with 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.109
 ultramarathon that are 50 km 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.449
 I'm going to run it first by goal 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.910
 staff that I proposed and trained 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.850
 for that and also because I promised to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.550
 many people that I will do as 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.649
 and sacrifice for all people 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.109
 ill especially by my grandmother who 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.870
 she is sick and therefore for many people 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:57.500
 who have been with me in all that 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.390
 they trust me and they know it does not matter 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.600
 the time I 'm going to do but I'm going to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 do 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.860
 It is an awesome challenge but I admire 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.090
 we were all given to everyone so that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.090
 know that we are aware 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.140
 if they need something 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.140
 of the team 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.220
 when time but the games 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.430
 the most important thing in this script career 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.430
 many people will come to support me 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 apart from the state 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.409
 it's the most basic thing that they'll be there 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.630
 with me and my dad is going to run this 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.850
 some accounts with me my husband 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.549
 correct of the ultramarathon with me 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.459
 also from you a few laps my 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.709
 twin and then many people go to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 run with me from my team and friends and 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.709
 everything that they are from 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.709
 also that they love to run 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.280
 apart I already like I put a chip in my 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.190
 head since I decided to run it and said 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.460
 I'm going to put up with 50 and tell everyone 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.190
 those who come to support me that 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.070
 I'm going to finish it exactly because 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.420
 I want to set an exact time but 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.420
 I'm going to finish it 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.110
 I always tell all people 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.080
 who know me that when you get to the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 goal you have to reach with the arms of 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.660
 up and smiling although I do whatever 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.420
 this is something that you are how to achieve 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.819
 something like this is 5 out of 10 or whatever 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.130
 Well, you are accomplishing what you said 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:26.010
 what were you going to do then you have 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.010
 who will celebrate with tears
