like<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.890> watch<00:01:59.040> us<00:01:59.369> sign<00:02:00.299> valve<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.280> or

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
like to watch us sign valve you know or

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.330 
like to watch us sign valve you know or
I<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> 32<00:02:04.500> 32<00:02:05.280> gig<00:02:05.670> card<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:06.509> well<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.469> there

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I have a 32 32 gig card as well in there

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.410 
I have a 32 32 gig card as well in there
and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:10.319> use<00:02:10.979> psychic<00:02:11.550> for<00:02:11.790> navigation

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and then I use psychic for navigation

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
and then I use psychic for navigation
because<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> uses<00:02:13.080> offline<00:02:13.560> maps<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.940> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
because it uses offline maps so you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
because it uses offline maps so you
don't<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.720> online<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.770> works

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
don't have to be online and it works

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.790 
don't have to be online and it works
really<00:02:20.220> good<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.629> just<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.650> know

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
really good so you would just you know

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.809 
really good so you would just you know
basically<00:02:23.069> navigate<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.150> where<00:02:25.050> you're<00:02:25.230> going

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
basically navigate to where you're going

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.940 
basically navigate to where you're going
drive<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.840> done<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.440> going<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> let

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
drive to and done and it's going to let

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
drive to and done and it's going to let
you<00:02:32.099> navigate<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.110> very<00:02:34.610> tactile<00:02:35.610> works

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you navigate so it's very tactile works

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
you navigate so it's very tactile works
good<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.620> anyway<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.190> you're<00:02:38.340> ever<00:02:38.610> thinking

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
good so anyway if you're ever thinking
