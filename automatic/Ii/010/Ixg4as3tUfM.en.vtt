00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
multiply and divide you know and all the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
multiply and divide you know and all the
steps<00:01:47.840> reducing<00:01:48.840> fractions<00:01:49.110> finding<00:01:49.829> least

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
steps reducing fractions finding least

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.740 
steps reducing fractions finding least
common<00:01:50.310> denominator<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> stuff<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.689> he

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
common denominator all that stuff but he

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
common denominator all that stuff but he
has<00:01:51.930> trouble<00:01:52.200> memorizing<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.070> fact<00:01:53.399> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
has trouble memorizing the fact that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550 
has trouble memorizing the fact that
simple<00:01:53.880> math<00:01:54.060> facts<00:01:54.450> okay<00:01:54.869> he<00:01:54.960> forgets<00:01:55.320> them

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
simple math facts okay he forgets them

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.760 
simple math facts okay he forgets them
so<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.100> drill<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> every<00:01:56.880> day<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.649> much

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so we drill that every day but how much

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.950 
so we drill that every day but how much
easier<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.969> those<00:02:00.149> processes<00:02:00.780> when

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
easier is it to do those processes when

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
easier is it to do those processes when
you<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.259> those<00:02:01.439> math<00:02:01.710> facts<00:02:02.040> committed<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you have those math facts committed to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
you have those math facts committed to
memory<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.540> understand<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> seven

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
memory well we understand that seven

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.760 
memory well we understand that seven
times<00:02:04.860> nine<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.960> count<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> seven<00:02:07.619> nine

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
times nine is you count to seven nine

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130 
times nine is you count to seven nine
times<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.310> count<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> nine<00:02:08.789> seven<00:02:09.569> times<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.050> we

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
times or count to nine seven times so we

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.400 
times or count to nine seven times so we
get<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.410> 63<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.670> memorize

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
get to 63 but to just memorize

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.210 
get to 63 but to just memorize
at<00:02:12.590> 63<00:02:13.310> how<00:02:13.850> much<00:02:14.000> easier<00:02:14.300> does<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.630> make<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.230> to

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
at 63 how much easier does it make it to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.100 
at 63 how much easier does it make it to
do<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:17.240> know<00:02:17.330> what<00:02:17.480> you're<00:02:17.630> doing

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
do you know what you're doing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.280 
do you know what you're doing
the<00:02:18.950> same<00:02:19.160> thing<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.610> music<00:02:20.150> here<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the same thing in music here we want to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.470 
the same thing in music here we want to
start<00:02:21.590> committing<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.520> circle<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.970> fifths<00:02:23.120> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
start committing the circle of fifths to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.360 
start committing the circle of fifths to
memory<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.200> said<00:02:24.380> start<00:02:24.830> committing<00:02:25.130> you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
memory and I said start committing you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
memory and I said start committing you
know<00:02:25.460> if<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.640> have<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.210> little<00:02:26.750> slow<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.140> some

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
know if you have a little slow on some

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.350 
know if you have a little slow on some
of<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.860> fine<00:02:28.100> but<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:29.000> need<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.210> start

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
of it that's fine but we need to start

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
of it that's fine but we need to start
memorizing<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.960> little<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.260> a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
memorizing we have a little bit of a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.400 
memorizing we have a little bit of a
test<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:30.980> we're<00:02:31.130> gonna<00:02:31.250> start<00:02:31.580> learning

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
test and then we're gonna start learning

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.910 
test and then we're gonna start learning
inversions<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.500> course<00:02:33.740> because<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.100> did

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
inversions of course because we did

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
inversions of course because we did
learn<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.100> chords<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.610> different<00:02:37.910> keys<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
learn the chords and different keys you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.090 
learn the chords and different keys you
know<00:02:38.960> see<00:02:39.170> I'm<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.830> key<00:02:40.010> of

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
know see I'm just going to do the key of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.370 
know see I'm just going to do the key of
C<00:02:40.310> for<00:02:40.580> ease<00:02:40.820> okay<00:02:41.180> c<00:02:41.930> e<00:02:41.960> g<00:02:42.140> DF<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:43.040> maybe<00:02:43.850> FAC

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
C for ease okay c e g DF a maybe FAC

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
C for ease okay c e g DF a maybe FAC
Jimmy<00:02:45.380> D<00:02:45.760> alright<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.300> all<00:02:47.420> live<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.630> chord

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
Jimmy D alright we can all live a chord

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.340 
Jimmy D alright we can all live a chord
that<00:02:48.050> way<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.660> called<00:02:50.990> root<00:02:51.170> position

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
that way and that's called root position

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.680 
that way and that's called root position
but<00:02:52.190> there<00:02:52.370> are<00:02:52.430> other<00:02:52.610> ways<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> cord<00:02:53.510> can

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
but there are other ways that a cord can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.260 
but there are other ways that a cord can
be<00:02:53.750> played<00:02:54.200> okay<00:02:54.920> first<00:02:55.280> inversion<00:02:55.640> second

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
be played okay first inversion second

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.020 
be played okay first inversion second
inversion<00:02:56.800> for<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.830> three<00:02:58.070> note<00:02:58.250> chord<00:02:58.550> that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
inversion for a three note chord that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.180 
inversion for a three note chord that
means<00:02:59.270> mixing<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> notes<00:03:00.170> around<00:03:00.410> alright

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
means mixing the notes around alright

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.890 
means mixing the notes around alright
and<00:03:01.370> sometimes<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.270> some<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.660> letters

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and sometimes that some of the letters

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.960 
and sometimes that some of the letters
will<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.200> double<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:03.950> you'll<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.850> know

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
will be double so you'll have you know

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.900 
will be double so you'll have you know
five<00:03:05.150> six<00:03:05.210> seven<00:03:05.810> eight<00:03:06.280> notes<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.490> one<00:03:07.640> time

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
five six seven eight notes at one time

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.310 
five six seven eight notes at one time
do<00:03:08.090> what<00:03:08.330> chord<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.050> don't<00:03:09.140> know

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
do what chord is that I don't know

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.050 
do what chord is that I don't know
because<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> notes<00:03:09.830> are<00:03:10.010> all<00:03:10.100> mixed<00:03:10.490> up<00:03:10.610> well

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
because the notes are all mixed up well

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.640 
because the notes are all mixed up well
I'm<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.360> show<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.600> how<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> unmix<00:03:12.470> them

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I'm going to show you how to unmix them

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.980 
I'm going to show you how to unmix them
and<00:03:13.100> how<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.370> see<00:03:14.060> what<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.630> name<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
and how to see what the name of the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.270 
and how to see what the name of the
chord<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.560> when<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.770> have<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> bunch<00:03:16.190> of

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
chord is in when you have a bunch of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.250 
chord is in when you have a bunch of
notes<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.640> they're<00:03:16.760> all<00:03:16.940> mixed<00:03:17.180> up<00:03:17.450> we're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
notes and they're all mixed up we're

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.000 
notes and they're all mixed up we're
going<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.470> learn<00:03:18.560> different<00:03:18.860> inversions

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
going to learn different inversions

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
going to learn different inversions
we're<00:03:19.250> gonna<00:03:19.340> learn<00:03:19.459> how<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.730> finger<00:03:20.030> those

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
we're gonna learn how to finger those

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.660 
we're gonna learn how to finger those
inversions<00:03:21.140> how<00:03:21.320> which<00:03:21.800> fingers<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.370> use<00:03:22.490> on

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
inversions how which fingers to use on

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.580 
inversions how which fingers to use on
those<00:03:22.820> that'll<00:03:23.390> feel<00:03:23.630> nice<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:23.900> comfortable

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
those that'll feel nice and comfortable
