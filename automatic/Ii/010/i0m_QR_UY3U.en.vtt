them in this colorway I'm guessing with

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.160 
them in this colorway I'm guessing with
the<00:00:31.890> bloody<00:00:32.189> teeth<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:34.040> yeah<00:00:35.719> see<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.989> one

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the bloody teeth and yeah see this one
