Boba Fett and the Carbonite of Han Solo

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
Boba Fett and the Carbonite of Han Solo
and<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:51.059> 165<00:00:51.899> pieces<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.920> green<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and it's 165 pieces it's green but I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.479 
and it's 165 pieces it's green but I
decided<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.079> grey<00:00:55.680> instead<00:00:55.949> because

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
decided to go with grey instead because

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
decided to go with grey instead because
the<00:00:59.489> slave<00:00:59.879> 1<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:01.109> gray<00:01:01.559> than

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the slave 1 is actually more gray than

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
the slave 1 is actually more gray than
it<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> green<00:01:03.140> because<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.400> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it is green because if we see here this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.920 
it is green because if we see here this
is<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> new<00:01:06.810> slave<00:01:07.140> 1<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.590> 2006<00:01:08.930> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is the new slave 1 from 2006 it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.000 
is the new slave 1 from 2006 it's
actually<00:01:10.320> more<00:01:10.590> gray<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> green<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:13.010> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
actually more gray than it is green so I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.350 
actually more gray than it is green so I
decided<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:14.939> grey<00:01:16.640> anyway<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:18.330> my

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

Carbonite goes into the storage

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.880 
Carbonite goes into the storage
compartment<00:02:10.720> right<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:13.040> cargo<00:02:13.490> hold

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.180 

like<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.950> said<00:02:28.190> earlier<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.910> did<00:02:29.240> add<00:02:29.450> some<00:02:29.870> new

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
modifications and I did change some
things<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.810> one<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.459> chained<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.850> of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
things for this one I chained and of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.930 
things for this one I chained and of
changed<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.630> because<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.890> original<00:02:40.550> ones<00:02:40.760> are

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
changed it because the original ones are

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.190 
changed it because the original ones are
supposed<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.600> turn<00:02:42.670> turn<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.570> wings<00:02:44.840> do

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
supposed to turn turn like the wings do

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.790 
supposed to turn turn like the wings do
like<00:02:46.190> if<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.490> turn<00:02:46.940> if<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.690> pick<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.440> slave

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
like if I turn if I pick up the slave

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.680 
like if I turn if I pick up the slave
one<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.580> wings<00:02:49.850> actually<00:02:50.300> turn<00:02:50.690> with<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
one the wings actually turn with the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.440 
one the wings actually turn with the
this<00:02:53.690> ship<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.670> supposed<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.209> do<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
this ship and it's supposed to do that

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.040 
this ship and it's supposed to do that
with<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.900> turrets<00:03:00.350> as<00:03:00.560> well<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.150> didn't

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
