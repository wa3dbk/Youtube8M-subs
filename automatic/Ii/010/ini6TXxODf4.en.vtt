00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
think he doesn't want to fight you and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.410 
think he doesn't want to fight you and
that's<00:02:34.100> why<00:02:34.220> he's<00:02:34.580> trying<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.120> these

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that's why he's trying to these
