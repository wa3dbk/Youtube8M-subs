ten thousand gems 25,000 gems and you
may<00:02:14.590> ask<00:02:14.769> why<00:02:15.310> should<00:02:15.370> i<00:02:16.200> generate<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.230> code

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
may ask why should i generate the code

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.009 
may ask why should i generate the code
for<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.069> month<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:19.269> generate<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.750> code

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
for one month when I can generate a code

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.190 
for one month when I can generate a code
for<00:02:20.260> six<00:02:20.470> month<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.310> code<00:02:21.549> for<00:02:21.880> one<00:02:22.599> month<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
for six month the code for one month and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.420 
for six month the code for one month and
for<00:02:23.709> example<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.400> 4000<00:02:25.209> gent<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:26.430> take

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
for example for 4000 gent they take

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.940 
for example for 4000 gent they take
almost<00:02:28.000> no<00:02:28.269> time<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.780> generate<00:02:28.989> maybe<00:02:29.530> five

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
almost no time to generate maybe five

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.430 
almost no time to generate maybe five
seconds<00:02:30.400> which<00:02:30.640> which<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.420> will<00:02:31.630> show<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.870> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
the code for six months membership or

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.390 
the code for six months membership or
for<00:02:36.340> twenty<00:02:36.730> five<00:02:37.000> thousand<00:02:37.870> gems<00:02:38.680> take

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
for twenty five thousand gems take

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.970 
for twenty five thousand gems take
approximate<00:02:40.329> two<00:02:40.540> hours<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.440> generate

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
approximate two hours to generate

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.330 
approximate two hours to generate
because<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.870> much<00:02:44.109> harder<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.560> bypass<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
because it is much harder to bypass the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.150 
because it is much harder to bypass the
security<00:02:45.489> measures<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.239> those<00:02:46.630> codes<00:02:46.989> but<00:02:47.799> I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
security measures for those codes but I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.900 
security measures for those codes but I
guess<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:49.209> could<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.480> generate<00:02:50.370> 12<00:02:51.370> codes

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
guess you could just generate 12 codes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.660 
guess you could just generate 12 codes
for<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.329> month<00:02:52.600> membership<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.459> can

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
for one month membership and you can

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.259 
for one month membership and you can
generate<00:02:55.090> them<00:02:55.389> in<00:02:55.420> no<00:02:56.019> time<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.269> just

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
generate them in no time and just

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.840 
generate them in no time and just
activate<00:02:58.840> them<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.290> you<00:03:00.190> will<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.549> more

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
activate them and you will have more

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.699 
activate them and you will have more
than<00:03:00.910> if<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.420> generate<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.500> have

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
than if you generate this but we have

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.610 
than if you generate this but we have
just<00:03:02.980> implemented<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.959> people<00:03:05.440> if

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
just implemented this for you people if

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.080 
just implemented this for you people if
you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.890 
you
at<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.870> time<00:03:07.110> for<00:03:07.410> waiting<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.099> long<00:03:08.900> it's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
at the time for waiting that long it's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.680 
at the time for waiting that long it's
the<00:03:10.020> same<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.860> gems<00:03:11.130> section<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.510> could

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the same in the gems section you could

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.580 
the same in the gems section you could
just<00:03:12.989> generate<00:03:13.730> five<00:03:14.870> four<00:03:15.870> thousand<00:03:16.380> gems

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
just generate five four thousand gems

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.460 
just generate five four thousand gems
and<00:03:16.860> in<00:03:17.580> one<00:03:18.150> minute<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.870> would<00:03:19.260> have

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
and in one minute and you would have

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.440 
and in one minute and you would have
almost<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.160> same<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.550> here<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.090> generate

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
almost the same as here you can generate

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.210 
almost the same as here you can generate
as<00:03:21.660> much<00:03:21.810> as<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.349> I'm<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:23.099> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
as much as you want I'm going to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.630 
as much as you want I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.420> one<00:03:24.750> month<00:03:25.019> membership

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
demonstrate it with one month membership

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.370 
demonstrate it with one month membership
you<00:03:26.640> can<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.090> generator<00:03:27.540> status<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.170> off

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you can see the generator status is off

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.860 
you can see the generator status is off
and<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.340> click<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.819> generate<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.420> code<00:03:30.630> it

and if I click on generate your code it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.089

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
see see the code here I'm going to

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.650 
see see the code here I'm going to
redeem<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.620> online<00:04:01.830> too<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.459> will<00:04:03.330> copy<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:05.660> you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
redeem it online too I will copy it you

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.620 
redeem it online too I will copy it you
can<00:04:06.900> see<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.530> will<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.160> same<00:04:08.459> code

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
yeah my my player login is new because I

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:34.470 
yeah my my player login is new because I
don't<00:04:15.540> play<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:15.959> game<00:04:16.200> at<00:04:16.350> all

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.420 

okay<00:04:35.480> um<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:36.410> connecting<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> server

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
okay um it's connecting to the server

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.790 
okay um it's connecting to the server
it's<00:04:38.240> taking<00:04:38.660> some<00:04:38.870> time<00:04:39.110> now<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.350> can<00:04:39.620> see

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
it's taking some time now you can see

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.520 
it's taking some time now you can see
the<00:04:39.950> coach<00:04:40.160> yeah<00:04:43.090> yeah<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.540> generate<00:04:45.350> as

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
the coach yeah yeah you can generate as

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.090 
the coach yeah yeah you can generate as
much<00:04:45.740> codes<00:04:46.100> as<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.580> want<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:47.840> works<00:04:48.380> for

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
much codes as you want it works for

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.580 
much codes as you want it works for
everyone<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.330> can<00:04:50.510> see<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.810> can't<00:04:51.050> get<00:04:51.290> pets

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590
