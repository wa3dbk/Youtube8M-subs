00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
guys this basically is a weapon that has

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
guys this basically is a weapon that has
a<00:01:13.890> brain<00:01:14.310> onto<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.299> spikes<00:01:15.600> hanging

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a brain onto it and two spikes hanging

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380 
a brain onto it and two spikes hanging
off<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> side<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> brain<00:01:18.090> comes

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
off the side and then the brain comes

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899 
off the side and then the brain comes
here<00:01:18.810> connects<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.460> goes

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
here connects to here then this goes

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.300 
here connects to here then this goes
back<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> foot<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> foot<00:01:22.770> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
back into a foot and the foot just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
back into a foot and the foot just
randomly<00:01:24.000> covers<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
randomly covers up the back and then I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
randomly covers up the back and then I
thought<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.210> pretty<00:01:27.509> cool<00:01:27.689> weapon<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thought this is pretty cool weapon so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
thought this is pretty cool weapon so
yeah<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> show<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> hero<00:01:30.210> core

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
yeah and then to show that the hero core

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.399 
yeah and then to show that the hero core
was<00:01:31.320> basically<00:01:31.890> gone<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.840> gone<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
was basically gone it's not gone but

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
was basically gone it's not gone but
like<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.549> grew<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.270> stuff<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
like it just grew this stuff around it I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
like it just grew this stuff around it I
couldn't<00:01:37.290> actually<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> hero<00:01:38.040> core<00:01:38.310> there

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
couldn't actually put a hero core there

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
couldn't actually put a hero core there
cuz<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.240> wouldn't<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.570> able<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.049> on

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
cuz I wouldn't be able to put these on

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.069 
cuz I wouldn't be able to put these on
but<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.430> grew<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:42.030> spikes<00:01:42.509> around<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
but it just grew these spikes around it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.090 
but it just grew these spikes around it
where<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:44.670> won't<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.000> able<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.439> like<00:01:46.439> function

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
where it won't be able to like function

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.730 
where it won't be able to like function
anymore<00:01:47.280> he's<00:01:47.579> zombified<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> changed

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
anymore he's zombified then I changed

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.429 
anymore he's zombified then I changed
Ferno<00:01:50.490> brain<00:01:50.850> attack<00:01:51.000> said<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> changed<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
Ferno brain attack said I changed the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.940 
Ferno brain attack said I changed the
inside<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> turned<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> green<00:01:54.950> once

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
inside of it I turned it green once

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
inside of it I turned it green once
again<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.520> him<00:01:56.640> look<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> he's<00:01:57.149> like

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
been brain defied I took these to make

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
been brain defied I took these to make
it<00:02:02.490> look<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.939> toxic<00:02:03.450> waste<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.869> oozing<00:02:04.140> out

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it look like toxic waste was oozing out

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.139 
it look like toxic waste was oozing out

done changing this weapon I had to take
some<00:02:29.879> time<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.269> design<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.920> had<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.790> take<00:02:33.599> a

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
some time to design I had to take a

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.649 
some time to design I had to take a
toxic-waste<00:02:34.500> looking<00:02:35.129> sword<00:02:35.610> put<00:02:36.090> some<00:02:36.329> fire

toxic-waste looking sword put some fire

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.020 
toxic-waste looking sword put some fire
around<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.319> then<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> had<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> take<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> new

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
around it then I had to take this new

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.670 
around it then I had to take this new
piece<00:02:39.269> right<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.440> mash

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
piece right here and just kind of mash

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.550 
piece right here and just kind of mash
it<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.010> took<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.849> silver<00:02:42.269> hand<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.319> added

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it in took this silver hand and I added

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.000 
it in took this silver hand and I added
a<00:02:43.860> red<00:02:44.010> spike<00:02:44.370> at<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.379> may

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
a red spike at the back and then you may

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.680 
a red spike at the back and then you may
notice<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.239> arms<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.670> armour<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.849> these

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
notice that the arms the armour on these

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
notice that the arms the armour on these
two<00:02:51.959> things<00:02:52.230> are<00:02:52.470> somewhat<00:02:53.430> different

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
two things are somewhat different

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.180 
two things are somewhat different
because<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.959> switched<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.560> armor<00:02:55.890> different

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
because I switched the armor different

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.740 
because I switched the armor different
ways<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.579> probably<00:02:56.849> can't<00:02:57.060> tell<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.450> well

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
ways you probably can't tell that well

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.460 
ways you probably can't tell that well
though<00:02:59.450> there<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.569> no<00:03:00.750> coverage<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> legs

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
though there is no coverage on the legs

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.949 
though there is no coverage on the legs
it's<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> hardest<00:03:02.579> thing<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.359> not

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
it's the hardest thing to do I'm not

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.920 
it's the hardest thing to do I'm not
sure<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.440> I've<00:03:04.560> seen<00:03:04.799> anyone<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:06.450> just
