 tablets since the start stopped 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.659

 go to skates and I'm not very comfortable for society 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.540
 from 2 3% to 2 3 points that was fast enough to put on 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.360
 this has a sound a little 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 hence a little less obvious what makes them more to aja help his costs 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.260

 port changed but here it is to share a little more time 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.470
 result in term of the first round the coulaines sarthe team to polluters 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.220
 find themselves in a small squad fighting for fifth place at a 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 thirty seconds of the top trio 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 the hours go by the winged renaissance scene and in this area 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.830
 each team to his very special tactics for lens this is where 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.920
 each group aims by techniques the detour of a series 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.640
 the taxi that is bearing fruit since it fell from the night the communes and 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.689
 is third with only two laps behind both 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.980
 teams of head grazing Mediterranean provence 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.270
 and office bontemps 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.870
 but the striker is fiercely about this third 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.830
 square 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.250
 even liked 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.570
 if we did not work well all year 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.840

 - 27 sections 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.980
 in the morning the positions seem frozen in the lead too much their 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.970
 mediterranean provence an advanced tour to the fronton of the group 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.060
 coulaines sarthe for the time is third with 6 laps behind but 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 in a pinch for the very many years crying 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.869
 the last hours of racing seems difficult every hour sparing 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.610
 person and some 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.610
 almost seems to be standing still 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.909

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.790
 chauny's one track is taking shape in the exact order of the top rpm ranking in 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.290
 head in front of bontemps office coulaines sarthe to give them rs 37 years 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.829
 Thieving generations 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.629
 a caterpillar that unfortunately will fall apart in the last lap 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.719
 provoking the disorderly hilarity of local conflicts during Provence 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.460
 Mediterranean 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.350

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.379
 menadi participants at sea 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.639
 we have been homogeneous in the summer and a super soldier so for that it's a pleasure 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.819
 to be able to gain stability of the stables that are in front 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.489
 it's at a level 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.059
 far above the others 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.349
 a consolation 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.719
 to them they are paid to vaccinate we are used to skate 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.089
 the difference is there 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.759
 we are not so far from knowing what the buzz on the rise in business and 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.979
 that we have no more towers at all 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.869
