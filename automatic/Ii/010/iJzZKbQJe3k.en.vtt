00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you want to make sure that when you're

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
you want to make sure that when you're
walking<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.500> tend<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.009> on<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.160> back

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and then you draw it out when you need

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120 
and then you draw it out when you need
it<00:00:27.509> because<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.289> can't<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.650> run<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.009> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

sort of down slash and if you follow it
up<00:00:34.410> afterwards<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:35.100> you'll<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> secondary

enough damage to them and then after

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.069 
enough damage to them and then after
that<00:00:44.730> you've<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.719> your

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that you've got a which is just your

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
that you've got a which is just your
standard<00:00:46.320> horizontal<00:00:47.010> attack<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.359> linking

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
standard horizontal attack now linking

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.180 
standard horizontal attack now linking
these<00:00:48.899> together<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.440> standard<00:00:49.770> combo<00:00:50.039> would

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
these together your standard combo would

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.970 
these together your standard combo would
be<00:00:50.340> X<00:00:50.579> ax<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> basically<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:52.199> standard

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
be X ax so you basically do standard

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
be X ax so you basically do standard
down<00:00:53.219> slash<00:00:53.519> then<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.420> swing

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
down slash then you do a to swing

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
down slash then you do a to swing
sideways<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.160> press<00:00:56.280> X<00:00:56.489> again

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
sideways and then you can press X again

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
sideways and then you can press X again
to<00:00:56.879> follow<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.289> alternatively<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> better

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to follow up alternatively the better

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
to follow up alternatively the better
way<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> press<00:01:00.120> X<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
way to do it if you press X and a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
way to do it if you press X and a
together<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.699> upward<00:01:03.030> swing<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
together you do an upward swing and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
together you do an upward swing and
that's<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> combo<00:01:05.100> combo<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that's really what the combo combo you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
that's really what the combo combo you
kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.180> would<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.540> X<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.980> then<00:01:08.220> X<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
kind of one would be X a and then X a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.010 
kind of one would be X a and then X a
together<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.930> what

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
together so that way you can see what

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.440 
together so that way you can see what
I'm<00:01:10.080> doing<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:11.160> swing<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.910> swing

there'll<00:01:43.260> be<00:01:43.290> three<00:01:43.530> flashes<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there'll be three flashes and when it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
there'll be three flashes and when it
does<00:01:44.760> when<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.240> does<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.480> third<00:01:45.630> flash<00:01:45.870> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
does when it does in the third flash and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.300 
does when it does in the third flash and
it<00:01:46.050> flashes<00:01:46.320> blue<00:01:46.410> that's<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.160> want<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it flashes blue that's when you want to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.130 
it flashes blue that's when you want to
let<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.750> when<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.050> get

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
let it go because that's when you get

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.750 
let it go because that's when you get
the<00:01:49.230> most<00:01:49.380> power<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:50.220> hold<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.490> too<00:01:50.610> long

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
the most power if you hold it too long

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.250 
the most power if you hold it too long
and<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> goes<00:01:51.090> past<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.080> get<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
and it goes past that then you get a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.740 
and it goes past that then you get a
level<00:01:52.440> one<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.070> charge<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.090> that's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
level one kind of charge so that's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.090 
level one kind of charge so that's
really<00:01:54.990> good<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.500> enemies<00:01:55.740> been<00:01:55.830> stunned

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
really good if an enemies been stunned

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.680 
really good if an enemies been stunned
or<00:01:56.370> if<00:01:56.580> they're<00:01:56.700> trapped<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.510> want<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
or if they're trapped and you want to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.760 
or if they're trapped and you want to
land<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.870> lot<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.050> damage<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.470> can<00:01:58.590> sort<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
land a lot of damage you can sort of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
land a lot of damage you can sort of
stand<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.220> charge<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.360> hit<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:01.170> from

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
make sure you do if you like or you want

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.990 
make sure you do if you like or you want
to<00:02:06.390> use<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.570> weapon<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.380> dr.<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.759> kind

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to use this weapon it is dr. what kind

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.960 
to use this weapon it is dr. what kind
of<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.509> call<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> hit<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.140> run<00:02:10.170> strategy

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
of what I call a hit and run strategy

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.339 
of what I call a hit and run strategy
because<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> said<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.629> quite<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> slow<00:02:12.989> weapon

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
because I said it's quite a slow weapon

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.800 
because I said it's quite a slow weapon
you<00:02:13.920> can't<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.760> know<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.540> want<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you can't you know you you don't want to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.240 
you can't you know you you don't want to
walk<00:02:15.900> around<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.409> run<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.859> so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
walk around with it or run with it so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.440 
walk around with it or run with it so
typically<00:02:17.609> what<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.849> do<00:02:17.939> is<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> ramp<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
typically what you do is you ramp to the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.190 
typically what you do is you ramp to the
enemy

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
enemy

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.890 
enemy
you<00:02:19.739> do<00:02:20.459> your<00:02:20.610> damage<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.720> when<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you do your damage and then when the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.089 
you do your damage and then when the
enemy<00:02:21.989> moves<00:02:22.290> out<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.440> range<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
enemy moves out of range you put the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.790 
enemy moves out of range you put the
sword<00:02:23.280> away<00:02:23.340> put<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.060> your<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.800> run

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sword away put it on your back run

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.580 
sword away put it on your back run
around<00:02:25.890> again<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.170> when<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.319> close

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
around again and then when you get close

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.920 
around again and then when you get close
you<00:02:28.890> draw<00:02:29.459> your<00:02:29.610> sword<00:02:29.819> out<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.180> combo<00:02:30.840> again

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you draw your sword out and combo again

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.070 
you draw your sword out and combo again
because<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.610> said<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.030> really<00:02:33.569> slow<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
because as I said it's really slow and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.910 
because as I said it's really slow and
you<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.590> want<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.830> walking

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you really don't want to be walking

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
you really don't want to be walking
around<00:02:35.129> with<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.660> are<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
around with it because you are going to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
around with it because you are going to
get<00:02:37.080> hit<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.550> you're<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
get hit and you're not really going to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.089 
get hit and you're not really going to
be<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.300> mobile<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.680> that's<00:02:40.860> something<00:02:41.010> you

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
be very mobile so that's something you

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.830 
be very mobile so that's something you
need<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> bear<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.849> mind<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.269> mean<00:02:42.660> that's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
need to bear in mind I mean that's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.120 
need to bear in mind I mean that's
something<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.260> kind<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:43.620> with<00:02:43.800> most

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
something you can kind of do with most

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.650 
something you can kind of do with most
weapons<00:02:44.280> anyway<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.060> tend<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.299> put<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.569> away

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
weapons anyway you tend to put it away

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930 
weapons anyway you tend to put it away
because<00:02:46.080> if<00:02:46.890> they're<00:02:47.130> out<00:02:47.250> then<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.549> can't<00:02:47.760> do

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
because if they're out then you can't do

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.410 
because if they're out then you can't do
a<00:02:48.209> die<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.930> anyway<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.400> still<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
a die of anyway but it's still it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.490 
a die of anyway but it's still it's
something<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.780> especially<00:02:52.140> applicable

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
something that's especially applicable

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.460 
something that's especially applicable
in<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.120> anyway<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.599> was<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> quick<00:02:55.290> overview

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
in this anyway that was a quick overview

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.380 
in this anyway that was a quick overview
