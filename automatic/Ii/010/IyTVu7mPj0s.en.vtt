00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.550
 the decalogue of planetary happiness not 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.550
 is written by men but if they have 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.340
 to find out and Jupiter laughs because 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.970
 his idiosyncrasies without questions 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.339
 answers he simply knows that he is the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.270
 largest planet and its knowledge no 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:24.400
 is imposed by demands of the sgae 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.100
 that eagerness for research and that 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.750
 insatiable curiosity are drunkenness of 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.810
 miracles on the moon 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.970
 that's why the trees are not white but 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.700
 we can paint each branch with graffiti 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.910
 ecological and kaleidoscopic colors 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.430
 stroke and the enchanted tree and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 squirrels in their wonderland ' and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
 the owl thanks us for having us 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.010
 reinvented to each tree branch with 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.010
 very careful 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.949
 From the root to the tips, those who cry 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.820
 they invented the new formula of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.630
 pantene and is that in his house they shout 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.239
 invoking negativity 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.590
 If the tree is not knocked down, it is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.409
 balanced conjunction of life 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.409
 firm and self-confident branches 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 that's why two symbols fall into the lithosphere 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.870
 that synthesize stories but not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.479
 carbon molecules and each necklace carries 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.060
 the signature of other winds and all this 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.060
 the inexorable passage of time 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.360
 I look at you and I know the face of vertigo 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 I demand patience and the just reward 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 for the last time and I demand a carpet 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 flying because we are infinite and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 are untying the knots we have been able to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 scream fuck me like it's the end of the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.200
 world and engaged in prior aid to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200
 exile 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.380
 although it has not changed the abrupt 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.060
 axis of the earth science assures us 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 that with the movement of the galaxy 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.130
 ideas are also moving 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.460
 agreement and leave reflected the list of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.020
 keys to the planetary happiness of 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.450
 Love writes free and smiles at fear 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.760
 fairies work badly 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.790
 its light heals more than any of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.580
 our medicines and beauty possess 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 an impossible force to tear down with 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.550
 weapons and with the fire that you invented jce 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.130
 each proposition is more beautiful than the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.019
 previous and quantis and monkeys matter what 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
 what do we do 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.190
 success exists therefore pride of 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.019
 human invented competitive in the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.370
 rungs up I do not know what dicks 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.590
 summit the excuses are the muses of 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 who does not assume his own neighborhood 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.730
 so no complaints and enjoy the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.000
 decision as if there was no 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 television look at what 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.430
 who lives with my arms 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.470
 enthusiasm and good sense to each one of 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.270
 our saints yes it is important deserves 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.270
 sacrifices and yes no 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.549
 classify the dreams that serve to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.060
 something that ingenuity I do not do or do with 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.280
 the rusty metal because the trees do not 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.530
 traffic with oxygen 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.560
 the essence of the stars is the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.840
 trust and the sun is the only judge of 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.940
 the only law that you have to obey though 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.040
 it is not condemning the drought 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.379
 the law of energy 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.680
 the one of the only system we have for 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.069
 sure the solar system with its 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.200
 famous dark side 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.719
 and speaking of fame for happiness 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.920
 planetary justin bieber 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.560
 peaches 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.690
 he and his representatives magnates 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.020
 choreographers makeup artists set designers and 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.840
 even the runners fuck impossible that 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.580
 live well even if they win in a day what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.739
 I took a while to spend a life with 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.130
 empty fridge has reached my ears 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.270
 its existence as an insipid 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.760
 consequence of keeping alert to the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.590
 profession but we always prefer that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 be another one that eat the shit and that 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.040
 is to carry the dead and that is to elude 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.440
 responsibilities 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.330
 I say it because in every conversation and in 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.660
 each reflection of each book follow 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:26.030
 cowards taking center stage if 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.449
 for this you have brought me pick up my 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.479
 panties and I piro 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.969
 but if there is a minimum chance of 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.849
 that what we love we do from a 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.069
 universal sense 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.830
 grabbed the desire of so many years doubting 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.349
 of the necessary truth greeting the era 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.580
 of aquarium and he left my life for the 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.580
 planetary happiness 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.200
 no no 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.069
 the
