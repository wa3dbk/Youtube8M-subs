and let me show you in my boat what they
look<00:01:34.619> like

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
look like

on my boat very easy actually I just did
the<00:01:40.230> hole<00:01:40.380> saw<00:01:40.620> right<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:40.980> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> top<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> my

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the hole saw right here on the top of my

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
the hole saw right here on the top of my
ranger<00:01:41.820> z520<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:43.140> both<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> port<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.890> the

ranger z520 on both the port and the
starboard<00:01:44.430> live<00:01:44.610> wells<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.120> installed<00:01:45.900> this

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
starboard live wells and installed this

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.800 
starboard live wells and installed this
in<00:01:46.320> four<00:01:46.560> stainless<00:01:46.860> steel<00:01:47.160> screws<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
in four stainless steel screws and and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
in four stainless steel screws and and
it's<00:01:48.960> flush<00:01:49.260> mounted<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.190> it's<00:01:50.640> you're<00:01:50.910> not

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
gonna trip over it it's not going to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.480 
gonna trip over it it's not going to
tear<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.500> basically<00:01:55.680> dispensed<00:01:56.310> right

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
tear up and it basically dispensed right

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.430 
tear up and it basically dispensed right
through<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:56.820> lid<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> now<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.900> great<00:01:58.260> thing

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
about this is that this baffle system

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.880 
about this is that this baffle system
right<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.660> prevents<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.380> water<00:02:01.650> from

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
right here prevents any water from

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
right here prevents any water from
spilling<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.370> so<00:02:02.550> if<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.700> run<00:02:02.820> down<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.120> lake

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
spilling out so if you run down the lake

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.610 
spilling out so if you run down the lake
on<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> rough<00:02:03.690> day<00:02:03.870> you're<00:02:04.050> not<00:02:04.140> gonna<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.470> any

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
on a rough day you're not gonna get any

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.469 
on a rough day you're not gonna get any
spills<00:02:04.979> come<00:02:05.190> out<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.400> your<00:02:05.520> live<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:05.940> so

spills come out of your live well so

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
spills come out of your live well so
that<00:02:06.600> baffle<00:02:06.990> system<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.440> great<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that baffle system is great and it's a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.699 
that baffle system is great and it's a
very<00:02:09.000> clean<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.540> slick<00:02:09.780> system<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.500> here's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
very clean and slick system but here's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.410 
very clean and slick system but here's

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
lake it's forcing fresh air through this

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.250 
lake it's forcing fresh air through this
top<00:02:20.010> part<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.520> lid<00:02:20.760> into<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.750> live<00:02:21.959> well

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
which then is gonna better oxygenate

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.960 
which then is gonna better oxygenate
your<00:02:24.930> water<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.830> gonna<00:02:26.040> keep<00:02:26.400> your<00:02:26.640> water
