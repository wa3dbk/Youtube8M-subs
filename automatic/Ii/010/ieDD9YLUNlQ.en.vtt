00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
wasn't directly connected to the game so

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.549 
wasn't directly connected to the game so
when<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.160> comes<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> horror<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.239> movies<00:00:49.200> and

when it comes to horror in movies and
video<00:00:49.829> games<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:51.360> works<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
video games it just works you can make a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
video games it just works you can make a
really<00:00:52.649> good<00:00:52.770> movie<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> horror<00:00:53.579> game
