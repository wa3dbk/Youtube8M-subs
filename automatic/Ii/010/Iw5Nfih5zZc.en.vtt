00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.480
 Hello friends 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.830
 today we will make a demonstration optimizing 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.339
 Our Brazilians are different. 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.189
 aiko, for this we need a 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:34.750
 nonstick skillet and blame a 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.750
 common frying pan and two glasses of milk 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.300
 we put the frying pans over medium heat 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.380
 pour the milk into the frying pan 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.000
 we expect milk to dry completely until 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 burn and then remove the liner 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.890
 after the milk has burned the residue already 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.610
 We would try in for the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.610
 common frying pan 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.400
 we will see that it is very difficult almost 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.400
 impossible 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.789
 now let's try to do the same with 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.789
 our non-stick frying pan the team 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
 I think it's easier to use your hands 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 so what we can observe we can see 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.840
 which is very efficient and healthy because 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 because we do not need to add 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 fat or oil to food to act 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.539
 as anti-adherent 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.539
 so we eat less fat 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.319
 this is a simple demonstration of the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.390
 our non-stick frying pan leave 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.409
 and remember with something you cook with 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.409
 more health live better
