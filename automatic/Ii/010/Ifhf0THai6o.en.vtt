00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.929
 I did it myself when I was in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.840

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.519

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 i had free time in td so for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 to make a tag 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.019

 that it is from me that I will put the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.270
 questions to hambach 9 years here I hope 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920

 my favorite equipment color I like 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.480
 many green the green apple the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 Belgian headband that I like 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 pretty simple colors actually 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 and apart from the green only here and 20 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.739
 after all that is pretty sober class 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.899
 the black all that I like well after 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 I had a little of everything 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 time that it goes well with the horse and that its 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.080
 life is a crush bat jacques 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 twists second question you prefer them 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 late and finally salt 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.150
 I'll give you appears to have since 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.460
 I find it prettier than those who have the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 form of the third question scene 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
 for grooming and you rather I go to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 the essential thing is to say and ribbon 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920
 on foot or rather to that for that I 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 I will not take it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 bam it depends we mean that when I 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.350
 go to a store of both 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 I do not immediately want to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 take all and sometimes I'm 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 hurry to riding bah I'm going to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.680
 the essential in general it will be and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.720
 standing ribbon when I'm in a hurry 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 4 you go back to his favorite shop 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.640
 to what rich teddy right now 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 down to 220 the equitation2 it seems 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.710
 logical and I will first look at everything 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.939
 which is 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.810
 the products the new products that 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.909
 have just come out 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.780
 then I'm going to watch some protections 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.450
 halter everywhere even though I already have everything 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.579
 I always have better to watch 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.259
 5 then ravages or black leather then 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.969
 paravan if there are any who do not know 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.269
 I hear brown like the one that is 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.489
 there as my son and bassam al sol 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.019
 since I both downstream I love the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.519
 brown leather for me black cabbage leather 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.110
 it's not too natural actually 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.549
 I like it I do not like it so much 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.989
 pure havana question 6 crazy like that and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:30.049
 who loves you norton and norton hb polo or 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.579
 scapa for debt because it's not 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.989
 super expensive and who loves you because it's 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 beautiful and not super expensive 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.840
 afterwards in terms of playing for the 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.000
 risk is not I agree these are 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.220
 super beautiful carpet beautiful sounded 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.170
 but put 100 euros in a carpet 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.620
 before gas jelly to this case no 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.060
 25th place unless I have to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.230
 sparkling water but no because I find 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.819
 it's super expensive they'll you for a 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.420
 carpet question this damper in sheep 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.849
 or a gel 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.220
 I have read in several studies that 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.590
 angele dampers like they have no 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.550
 gutters and this is often the case kind 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.739
 as guarding it including same 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.090
 the back of the horse and it's not good and I 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.430
 therefore preferred the sheep because it is 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.170
 the more solid the gel breaks and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.330
 frankly the sheep is super sweet 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.930
 it's super nice for the horse and 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.769
 in addition it is beautiful 8 gaiters firm is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.209
 open to polo tapes I want to do 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.190
 my gaiters open because it's more 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.209
 periguous aesthetic to close and I like 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.230
 well polo sales since she 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.480
 will come in many colors and that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.790
 this case question number 9 when you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.260
 do a set you go to where it's 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.780
 to say leggings you have people blow 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.930
 really good in general I take the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.330
 carpets and be there the halter not often 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.470
 because yes like I can I will do this 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.870
 that I find it beautiful and everything but I 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.690
 already lincoln leather then in general 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.040
 to use the uses his time after 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.239
 the cover does not eat there is no 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.170
 other covers raemdonck 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.380
 not even if it pleases issue halters 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.910
 foods a good ps nicole leather i would say 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.470
 more indie leather collar simply 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.940
 because I find it more classy 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.820
 certainly it's more expensive but it's more 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.600
 solid 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.400
 after lily cole pink cheeks at mulhouse 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.630
 I love them the colors 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.760
 Too beautiful like you for 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.380
 realize the red carpet there is too much 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.690
 short a question 11 to carry 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.680
 your gear you have a crash box or 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.390
 a bag I have the 2 is currently 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.000
 I use a grooming bag because I 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.220
 find that it's bulky me actually 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.990
 than the box that super rigid and we can 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.720
 not pack the day all two years 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 after it's big and everything but and I 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.419
 think that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.879
 there with the greens I'll rather take 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.340
 a box of grooming because food 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.319
 lactating haddock 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.970
 if I ever get to rain at the pub at 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:56.770
 least I can close it and it remains to 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:58.000
 dry 12 who are treating 8 seaweed and I 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.190
 water that I do not know what I have 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.080
 did anything and I came out I 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
 I'm sorry that usually I actually 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.780
 could always marketed worries one 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:14.050
 was telling me you size and joe to welcome 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:18.539
 right in the time the pod and 16 goethe 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.750
 with darts breier I size of 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.300

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:29.319
 I could you are gay who is I'm going 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.830
 tagged and who you fans but that 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.789
 would surprise me that she is watching the video 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.789
 then in addition to coffee no video 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.360
 I attack then this force and look at the 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.740
 fixed video and at worst you prune yourself 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.539
 all alone if I ever told you 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.430
