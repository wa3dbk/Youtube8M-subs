00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.750
 Kathrin Lauer is worried about the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 nutrition of your children the mother bought 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:19.949
 consciously as an animal lands with her 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:21.539
 no longer in the shopping cart fast 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.539
 be bred and with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.599
 be stuffed with drugs 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.949
 I just do not want to eat this anymore 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 but can she even care 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 supposedly renounce the many 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 hide meatless foods 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 Often animal ingredients are funny-fresh 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.450
 potato chips of the sort hungarian 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 included eg wild, however, that stands 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.390
 notebook why should I know 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 that Hungarian means meat 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.460
 Extracts in there are that he knows 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 none 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.550
 but since you feel then quite 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.430
 beautiful misguided 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.470
 So what's in the product fish? 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.810
 beef and wild are hiding as 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.409
 enzymes or extracts in this 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.729
 brand fanny fischer potato chips 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.930
 Shellac is an animal product 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.670
 are the hearted ones 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.490
 excretions of the Asian lag 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.259
 Shield laos these are from the branch 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.420
 scratched and colored differently 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.190
 Shellac processed as over 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.470
 Zugsmittel lends it furniture 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.470
 but also chocolate a noble gloss 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 another sign laos art the way 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.979
 said cuddle is dried too 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 a red dye processed on 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.700
 ingredient lists the animal camouflages itself 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.700
 dye as a real fireplace 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.100
 the house bubble is the bubble 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.100
 the trouble with it wine is clarified 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.710
 also with pigskin gelatin and 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.229
 Bone fruit juices are made clear 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.819
 that hardly anyone knows gelatin 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.429
 also in the more fruit juices of 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.719
 valensina and high c as a carrier 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.090
 for vitamin supplements why is asking passers 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.229
 Do you have any idea what animals are in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.229
 which product is stuck 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.510
 So there is now even without gelatin 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.170
 but what's to come now are banks 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.170
 perhaps 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.069
 there is definitely dyes in there as well 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 there could also be many in the country 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.390
 through excretions galaxy at louse 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.200
 So I can not care about that at all 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.610
 imagine that coach can be 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.830
 seven out of nine passers-by could 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.519
 maximum one product of the ingredients 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.319
 assign 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.480
 because not all animal ingredients 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.319
 stand on the label how to find the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.319
 consumer that 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.060
 bush 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.400
 chocolate on my furniture if you like 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.560
 vegetarian is one wants that completely 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:07.170
 does not determine animal ingredients 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120
 only have to be specified as an ingredient 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.159
 if you are a substantial part 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.989
 of the product or as 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.799
 Allergy risk applies as for example 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.510
 Fish protein must have the ingredients 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.640
 not be marked if it is 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.440
 so-called processing aids 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.329
 which does not stay in the product 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.019
 or only in the smallest amounts in it 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.019
 available 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.640
 Kathrin Bauer knows the problem and 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.239
 try it on your shopping too 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.209
 circumnavigate 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.980
 But can you use animal ingredients 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.109
 Avoid if you alone the labels 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.090
 the manufacturer can trust yourself 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.220
 vegetarian according to your ideas 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.220
 feed meatless or purely vegetable 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.070
 Trust is good, control is better 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.720
 in fact, two-thirds include 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.820
 to set their true animal 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.350
 only a third is apparently free of it 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.310
 at least if you have the manufacturer information 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.200
 So I think so 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.660
 no chance so now if I'm more pure 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.220
 I'm a vegetarian and I just want to 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.750
 do not eat meat 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.410
 then I'm duped 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.360
 it still meat clarity on the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.390
 Label therefore requires consumers 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.580
 organization foodwatch 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.290
 So it is a pity that people are 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.120
 just want to eat meat-free 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.860
 for religious reasons 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.870
 certain animals want to avoid them 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.180
 Do not recognize by the packaging 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.770
 can if there is an animal product 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.230
 is included we want that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.450
 Manufacturers are obliged to 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.340
 write where animal is in there must be too 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.850
 animal just stand on it 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.740
 Declaration obligation exists in 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.600
 Germany not on the homepage of 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.610
 Although knight sport is that the dark 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.590
 milk chocolate shellac is eliminated 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.270
 insured on our request 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.990
 manufacturer that no decorative products 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.990
 be used 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.690
 different with the multivitamin juice of high c 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.240
 there is nothing of animal stock 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.450
 only on demand we learn that the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.400
 juice contains gelatin at the 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.950
 Declaration of animal ingredients is 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.420
 us Britain has far ahead there 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.920
 the food industry is on the 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.550
 Growing vegetarian community 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.620
 adjusted 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.110
 voluntarily without legal regulations 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.790
 As in the Munich delicatessen British 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.370
 source stands on appropriate 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.250
 products cheers from the budget aliens so 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.050
 suitable for vegetarians big 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.510
 Supermarkets that really have extreme 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.340
 rich for where it does not matter above 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.680
 really a sign suitable for vegetarians 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.120
 and you too the newspaper on it 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.810
 that really one does not feel 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.220
 completed 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.870
 You can still be a normal citizen 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.510
 go and we look at the goods 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.280
 Everything really characterizes who 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.960
 on the safe side in this country 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.840
 I want to either pay attention to that 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.700
 Volunteer vegetarian logo or avoids 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.200
 industrially produced foods 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.200
 as far as it goes
