look this is a Primrose jasmine
and<00:00:13.389> it's<00:00:13.660> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.840 

there's<00:00:17.199> these<00:00:17.529> big<00:00:18.070> long<00:00:18.340> branches

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
there's these big long branches

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.870 
there's these big long branches
everywhere<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.890> whether<00:00:21.279> they<00:00:21.460> touch<00:00:21.670> the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
everywhere and whether they touch the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.960 
everywhere and whether they touch the
ground<00:00:21.910> I'll<00:00:22.689> put<00:00:22.869> down<00:00:22.900> roots<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:24.520> course<00:00:24.790> you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
ground I'll put down roots of course you

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.700 
ground I'll put down roots of course you
can<00:00:25.119> help<00:00:25.270> them<00:00:25.570> by<00:00:25.630> putting<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.320> bit<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.470> dirt

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
can help them by putting a bit of dirt

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.370 
can help them by putting a bit of dirt
on<00:00:27.009> the<00:00:27.340> UM<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.759> bit<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.450> soil<00:00:28.750> where<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.080> touches

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
on the UM a bit of soil where it touches

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.259 
on the UM a bit of soil where it touches
the<00:00:29.560> ground<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:32.019> they<00:00:32.710> just<00:00:33.059> multiply<00:00:34.059> so

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
the ground but they just multiply so

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.799 
the ground but they just multiply so
easily<00:00:34.449> by<00:00:34.720> themselves<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:36.670> see<00:00:36.910> where

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
easily by themselves you can see where

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.650 
easily by themselves you can see where

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.600 

and<00:02:11.900> Primrose<00:02:12.380> jasmine<00:02:12.410> flowers<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.490> very

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and Primrose jasmine flowers are very

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.460 
and Primrose jasmine flowers are very
nice<00:02:14.890> yeah

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470

Pompey<00:02:18.520> Wow<00:02:20.410> yes<00:02:21.410> beautiful<00:02:22.340> flowers<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
Pompey Wow yes beautiful flowers and the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.150 
Pompey Wow yes beautiful flowers and the
shrub<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.800> quite<00:02:25.040> drought<00:02:25.280> resistant<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
shrub is quite drought resistant and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.100 
shrub is quite drought resistant and
very<00:02:28.160> easy<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.460> multiply<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:29.690> way<00:02:29.840> by<00:02:30.080> just

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
very easy to multiply that way by just

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.450 
very easy to multiply that way by just
digging<00:02:30.500> them<00:02:30.740> up<00:02:30.830> from<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.280> call

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
digging them up from what they call

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.210 
digging them up from what they call
layers<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.060> think<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.840> think<00:02:33.470> horticulturalist

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
layers I think I think horticulturalist

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.590 
layers I think I think horticulturalist
call<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.580> layering<00:02:34.820> when<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.270> grow<00:02:35.420> them

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
call that layering when you grow them

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.330 
call that layering when you grow them
like<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.110> they<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.130> by

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
like that but they just do it by

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.830 
like that but they just do it by
themselves<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.240> may<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.480> well<00:02:38.570> take

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
themselves so you may as well take

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.500 
themselves so you may as well take
advantage<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.250> here's<00:02:43.700> another<00:02:43.880> prima

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
advantage of it and here's another prima

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.740 
advantage of it and here's another prima
as<00:02:44.570> jasmine<00:02:45.550> I've<00:02:46.550> got<00:02:46.760> several<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.300> them<00:02:47.600> all

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
as jasmine I've got several of them all

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.630 
as jasmine I've got several of them all
multiplied<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.440> same<00:02:48.650> way<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.130> by<00:02:49.310> digging

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
multiplied the same way just by digging
