large maps there's a lot of buildings

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530 
large maps there's a lot of buildings
and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> maps<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.189> played<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.700> far<00:01:53.729> um<00:01:54.240> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and the maps that played so far um I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.469 
and the maps that played so far um I
mean<00:01:55.170> its<00:01:55.610> overall<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.969> probably<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
mean its overall this is probably the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.819 
mean its overall this is probably the
best<00:01:57.630> Call<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> Duty<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> came<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
best Call of Duty I came and do it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.350 
best Call of Duty I came and do it
thinking<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.790> know<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> be

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thinking you know it's going to be

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
thinking you know it's going to be
called<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.380> probably<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
called it's probably gonna get all the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
called it's probably gonna get all the
sales<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> best<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.750> I

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
