that so even though you put it into
expert<00:02:07.829> mode<00:02:08.069> say<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.729> find<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
expert mode say you find that the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.250 
expert mode say you find that the
it's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:11.239> abrupt<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.959> slow

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
it's a little too abrupt you can slow

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.729 
it's a little too abrupt you can slow
that<00:02:13.470> down<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.540> much<00:02:15.750> thought<00:02:16.230> has<00:02:16.709> been

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
that down so so much thought has been

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.140 
that down so so much thought has been
put<00:02:16.980> into<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.610> development<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.930> little

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
put into the development of this little

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.449 
put into the development of this little
multicopter<00:02:21.150> multi<00:02:21.569> rotor<00:02:21.810> copter<00:02:22.409> that<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
multicopter multi rotor copter that I

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.179 
multicopter multi rotor copter that I
was<00:02:23.879> totally<00:02:24.329> shocked<00:02:24.629> for<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> pricing<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
was totally shocked for the pricing it

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.089 
was totally shocked for the pricing it
is<00:02:26.689> way<00:02:27.689> beyond<00:02:28.109> what<00:02:28.470> you're<00:02:28.799> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> end

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
is way beyond what you're going to end

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.089 
is way beyond what you're going to end
up<00:02:29.189> paying<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.030> quality<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:31.260> allows<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:32.069> to

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
up paying in in quality it allows you to

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.970 
up paying in in quality it allows you to
take<00:02:32.790> moderate<00:02:33.599> hits<00:02:34.319> what<00:02:34.620> you're<00:02:34.769> going<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
take moderate hits what you're going to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.530 
take moderate hits what you're going to
do<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.459> you're<00:02:35.640> beginning<00:02:36.180> even<00:02:36.359> when

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
do when you're beginning even when

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660 
do when you're beginning even when
you're<00:02:36.750> advanced<00:02:37.109> there's<00:02:37.769> little<00:02:38.159> areas

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you're advanced there's little areas

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.509 
you're advanced there's little areas
here<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.269> they<00:02:40.260> design<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.980> hard<00:02:41.189> to<00:02:41.310> see

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
here that they design it's hard to see

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.360 
here that they design it's hard to see
from<00:02:41.549> here<00:02:41.819> but<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.769> developed<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:43.950> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
from here but they developed it so that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.899 
from here but they developed it so that
it<00:02:44.700> will<00:02:44.879> snap<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.859> won't<00:02:47.099> break<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.609> what

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
it will snap and it won't break and what

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.629 
it will snap and it won't break and what
all<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.389> have<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.629> do<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.200> snap<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.190> put

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
all you have to do is just snap it put

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.339 
all you have to do is just snap it put
it<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.909> into<00:02:51.120> place<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.659> you're<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.200> go

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
it back into place and you're good to go

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.720 
it back into place and you're good to go
the<00:02:53.040> props<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.329> pull<00:02:55.109> off<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.700> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to tell people give it a little bit of a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.539 
to tell people give it a little bit of a
throttle<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.120> what<00:03:09.870> happens<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.680> prop<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
throttle and what happens the prop that

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.449 
throttle and what happens the prop that
stuck<00:03:12.030> will<00:03:12.510> fall<00:03:12.810> off<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.470> hopefully<00:03:14.310> it

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
stuck will fall off and hopefully it

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.610 
stuck will fall off and hopefully it
will<00:03:14.579> tumble<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.720> catch<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.199> or<00:03:16.319> it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
will tumble and you can catch it or it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.920 
will tumble and you can catch it or it
will<00:03:16.769> land<00:03:16.949> on<00:03:17.160> something<00:03:17.459> soft<00:03:17.760> but<00:03:18.419> getting

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
will land on something soft but getting

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.640 
will land on something soft but getting
back<00:03:19.199> to<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.790> hubsan<00:03:21.060> x4<00:03:23.989> products<00:03:24.989> they're

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
back to the hubsan x4 products they're

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.099 
back to the hubsan x4 products they're
they're<00:03:26.250> great<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.780> take

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.110 
they're great and I think if you take
the<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.799> look<00:03:28.980> at<00:03:29.159> them<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.609> have<00:03:29.909> and
