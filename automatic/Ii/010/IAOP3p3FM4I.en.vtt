00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
from the dinosaur times I don't know why

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
from the dinosaur times I don't know why
they<00:00:34.079> call<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> delicious

right here so this helps soften it up
right<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.579> does<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
right here so it does have that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.840 
right here so it does have that
chewiness<00:00:48.620> another<00:00:49.620> option<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.340> taking

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
chewiness another option is just taking

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470 
chewiness another option is just taking
some<00:00:51.600> spinach<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.469> arugula<00:00:53.120> cornet<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
some spinach or arugula cornet so this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
veggies more we're gonna start with a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.289 
veggies more we're gonna start with a
base<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.229> dressing<00:01:07.740> stay<00:01:08.430> low<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> oils

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
base for dressing stay low on the oils

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.200 
base for dressing stay low on the oils
although<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.229> oils<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> healthy

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
although some oils have a lot of healthy

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
although some oils have a lot of healthy
benefits<00:01:12.390> they're<00:01:12.810> very<00:01:12.990> caloric<00:01:13.470> dense<00:01:13.740> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
benefits they're very caloric dense so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
benefits they're very caloric dense so
in<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> case<00:01:14.820> we're<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> use<00:01:15.210> very

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
in this case we're going to use very

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170

limited<00:01:16.650> oils<00:01:17.009> keep<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.880> healthy

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
limited oils keep it really healthy

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
limited oils keep it really healthy
we're<00:01:18.750> using<00:01:18.869> Bragg's<00:01:19.409> raw<00:01:20.040> apple<00:01:20.549> cider

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it's going to be our base for a blessing

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.359 
it's going to be our base for a blessing
right<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.330> usually<00:01:27.869> poor<00:01:28.280> maybe<00:01:29.280> a

here going to take that out shake it up
a<00:04:49.580> little<00:04:49.700> bit<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.210> then<00:04:50.810> we're<00:04:50.930> going<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.110> put

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
a little bit and then we're going to put

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:01.279 
a little bit and then we're going to put
on<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> little<00:04:51.590> blender

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.929

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
again is great for natural digestive

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.350 
again is great for natural digestive
enzymes<00:05:32.469> and<00:05:32.710> really<00:05:32.979> helps<00:05:33.279> you<00:05:33.460> break<00:05:34.150> down

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
the rest of your food most of the foods

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.279 
the rest of your food most of the foods
we<00:05:36.279> there<00:05:36.639> are<00:05:36.729> processed<00:05:37.330> lack<00:05:38.050> those

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
we there are processed lack those

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.899 
we there are processed lack those
enzymatic<00:05:38.680> properties<00:05:39.279> that<00:05:39.400> we<00:05:39.490> need<00:05:39.699> to

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
enzymatic properties that we need to

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.969 
enzymatic properties that we need to
absorb<00:05:40.210> them<00:05:40.449> properly<00:05:40.889> therefore<00:05:41.889> it's

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
absorb them properly therefore it's

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.510 
absorb them properly therefore it's
robbing<00:05:42.550> your<00:05:42.819> body<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.529> energy<00:05:44.529> that<00:05:45.310> could

robbing your body of energy that could

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.820 
robbing your body of energy that could
be<00:05:45.639> elsewhere<00:05:46.000> for<00:05:46.330> recovery<00:05:47.020> or<00:05:47.229> brain

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
be elsewhere for recovery or brain
