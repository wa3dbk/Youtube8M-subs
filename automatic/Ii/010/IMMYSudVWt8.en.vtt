00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone, I have received a parcel today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.359
 I ordered a skete and a portable 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.139
 built-in speaker system 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.530
 battery and flash drive with fm radio for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.760
 bike open now let's see what 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.760
 there is doing here 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.790
 because as a caster 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:38.410
 there are two of them there 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.100
 from batteries around 8 10 hours and with 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.100
 headphones 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.890
 That's how they look 1 Looks like this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.550
 try the meek ones exactly the same 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.290
 should be black but black here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:02.500
 so here is such an interesting 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.019
 the thing here is micro sd 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 card headphone jack 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.630
 it also serves as a line input and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.590
 charging and also syncing with 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.740
 by computer 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.070
 that is, you can move back and forth 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:23.560
 so open the second immediately see there 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.990
 completeness 2 looks like this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.979
 looks like even prettier 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 than just black well, functions are all one and 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.590
 the same is just the body different now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 let's see the package bundle 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:46.130
 bike carrier instruction on 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 Chinese and English have headphones 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 I will not even check their headphones 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.080
 I understand what quality cable they are 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.790
 charging usb micro usb strap for 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.200
 mounts on the bike and the second strap 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:09.420
 too for bike carrying bag on 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.500
 The hand is such a cable for a linear 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.720
 I basically read the entrance right now 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.760
 instructions and tell you how it all 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.519
 works but generally figured out this 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.350
 pretty cool thing and 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.260
 interesting you can take with you even to the sea 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.720
 take and always me out in principle even 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.080
 go to work we turn on the play button 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.280
 pause long hold it is responsible for 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.600
 on off 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.120
 m switch radio modes mp3 player and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.410
 line input and buttons well I understand 3 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 play mp3 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.120
 forward back tracks of debt and retention 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.810
 it adjusts the volume 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 all include 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.680
 But there already inserted a micro sd card 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.680
 plays here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.500
 playing pretty not bad for such 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.459
 small dynamics of clarity something is not 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.700
 gives but 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.700
 as a marching option a great thing 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.730
 now turn on checked this radio here 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 plays radio headphones serve as an antenna 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.670
 everywhere as a principle everywhere mobile 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.170
 the phone reception is pretty steady 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.590
 normal but don't know what else to say 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.209
 play button long hold starts 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.050
 auto search all radio stations are remembered 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:51.360
 in memory and with the buttons left and right then 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.040
 choose all stations in order of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.760
 In principle, a good thing I will order 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.000
