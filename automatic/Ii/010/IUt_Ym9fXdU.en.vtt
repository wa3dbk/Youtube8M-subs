00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
realize there's no support in there so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870 
realize there's no support in there so
if<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:45.170> go<00:01:45.320> down<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.009> real<00:01:46.310> easy<00:01:46.579> for<00:01:46.610> your

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
definitely don't want that to happen so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.830 
definitely don't want that to happen so
and<00:02:49.310> that's<00:02:49.730> another<00:02:49.970> drawback<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.510> riding<00:02:50.780> in

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.410 
definitely need your laces tucked away
this<00:02:54.859> is<00:02:55.010> gonna<00:02:55.129> keep<00:02:55.640> them<00:02:55.819> protected<00:02:55.970> also

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
this is gonna keep them protected also

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.059 
this is gonna keep them protected also
keeps<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:56.930> sleek<00:02:57.290> looking<00:02:57.590> nice<00:02:57.890> and

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
keeps it really sleek looking nice and

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.770 
keeps it really sleek looking nice and
low-profile<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:59.120> do<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.390> little<00:02:59.569> bit<00:02:59.750> of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
low-profile you do have a little bit of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.690 
low-profile you do have a little bit of
perforation<00:03:00.230> through<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.769> tongue<00:03:00.950> here<00:03:01.519> and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
perforation through the tongue here and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.420 
perforation through the tongue here and
a<00:03:02.030> little<00:03:02.299> bit<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.810> fabric<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.980> back<00:03:04.129> here

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
a little bit of fabric on the back here

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.819 
a little bit of fabric on the back here
so<00:03:04.609> I<00:03:04.640> imagine<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.510> breathability<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.349> gonna

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
so I imagine that breathability is gonna

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.140 
so I imagine that breathability is gonna
be<00:03:06.980> fairly<00:03:07.220> good<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.579> these<00:03:07.700> as<00:03:07.910> well<00:03:08.090> so

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
be fairly good on these as well so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.199 
be fairly good on these as well so
