00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.810

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
well I felt good about and that was

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.659 
well I felt good about and that was
unprecedented<00:05:15.890> in<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.789> many<00:05:16.970> ways<00:05:18.070> but<00:05:19.070> but<00:05:19.460> I

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
unprecedented in so many ways but but I

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.670 
unprecedented in so many ways but but I
won't<00:05:19.940> be<00:05:20.060> really<00:05:20.330> clear<00:05:20.570> we<00:05:20.750> never<00:05:21.289> single

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
won't be really clear we never single

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.469 
won't be really clear we never single
out<00:05:21.890> any<00:05:22.130> individual<00:05:22.640> people<00:05:23.090> say<00:05:23.240> why<00:05:23.419> did

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
you take coach Paterno those records

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.810 
you take coach Paterno those records
away<00:05:25.820> from<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.180> we<00:05:26.300> did<00:05:26.830> we<00:05:27.830> vacated<00:05:28.729> the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
away from it we did we vacated the

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.000 
away from it we did we vacated the
universities<00:05:29.360> we<00:05:29.930> didn't<00:05:30.140> vacate<00:05:30.260> yours<00:05:30.830> we

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
universities we didn't vacate yours we

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.719 
universities we didn't vacate yours we
didn't<00:05:31.220> well<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.580> were<00:05:31.669> not<00:05:32.150> yes<00:05:32.600> but<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:36.729> 1972

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
didn't well you were not yes but in 1972

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.760 
didn't well you were not yes but in 1972
but<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.650> guess<00:05:39.650> my<00:05:39.860> question<00:05:40.370> was<00:05:41.200> how<00:05:42.200> did<00:05:42.260> you

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
but I guess my question was how did you

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.060 
but I guess my question was how did you
or<00:05:43.190> your<00:05:43.220> board<00:05:43.729> come<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.390> determination

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
or your board come to that determination

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.130 
or your board come to that determination
that<00:05:46.070> don't<00:05:46.700> return<00:05:47.000> or<00:05:47.479> whether<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.990> was

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
that don't return or whether it was

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.090 
that don't return or whether it was
guilty<00:05:48.590> when<00:05:49.490> those<00:05:50.330> two<00:05:50.630> in<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.740> know<00:05:51.860> those

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
guilty when those two in you know those

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.690 
guilty when those two in you know those
two<00:05:52.340> circumstances<00:05:53.270> in<00:05:53.530> 1998<00:05:54.550> denied<00:05:55.550> either

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
two circumstances in 1998 denied either

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.680 
two circumstances in 1998 denied either
involved<00:05:56.330> Penn<00:05:56.600> State<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:57.550> 2001<00:05:58.550> with<00:05:59.450> the

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
involved Penn State and 2001 with the

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.500 
involved Penn State and 2001 with the
jury<00:06:00.169> found<00:06:00.650> that<00:06:00.919> there<00:06:01.280> was<00:06:01.400> not<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.970> sexual

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
jury found that there was not a sexual

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.740 
jury found that there was not a sexual
assault<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.090> guess<00:06:05.300> that's<00:06:05.510> my

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
assault and and so I guess that's my

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.719 
assault and and so I guess that's my
question<00:06:05.810> in<00:06:06.440> yeah<00:06:06.590> yeah

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
question in yeah yeah

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.159 
question in yeah yeah
make<00:06:08.849> sure<00:06:08.999> to<00:06:09.210> do<00:06:09.330> all<00:06:09.389> the<00:06:09.509> senate<00:06:09.779> time<00:06:09.960> how

long to get to others that the short

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.749 
long to get to others that the short
answer<00:06:12.870> is<00:06:12.900> that<00:06:13.139> we<00:06:13.770> relied<00:06:14.279> heavily<00:06:14.309> upon

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
answer is that we relied heavily upon

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.629 
answer is that we relied heavily upon
