wait<00:00:14.000> black<00:00:15.000> paper<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> work<00:00:16.230> well<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.369> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
wait black paper as I work well if you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
wait black paper as I work well if you
took<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.730> physics<00:00:18.270> class<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.779> will<00:00:18.869> know<00:00:19.050> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
took a physics class you will know that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
took a physics class you will know that
color<00:00:20.189> black<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:21.859> actually<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.130> lack<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> color

because it absorbs all of the color now

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.990 
because it absorbs all of the color now
with<00:00:27.750> enough<00:00:28.320> sheet<00:00:28.619> energy<00:00:29.099> produced<00:00:29.820> from

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
with enough sheet energy produced from

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.299 
with enough sheet energy produced from
your<00:00:30.269> fingers<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.710> able<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.980> release

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
your fingers you will be able to release

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
your fingers you will be able to release
the<00:00:32.489> colors<00:00:32.790> absorbed<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> black<00:00:34.200> paper

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the colors absorbed from the black paper

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.720 
the colors absorbed from the black paper
right<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:34.890> okay<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.210> step<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> to

of<00:00:45.300> ninja<00:00:45.420> stars<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.050> appear<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:47.039> vary

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of ninja stars I will appear will vary

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
of ninja stars I will appear will vary
on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> size<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> paper<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.860> hold

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
on the size of paper you use so you hold

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
on the size of paper you use so you hold
two<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.789> each<00:00:51.030> hand<00:00:51.360> each<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.559> will

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
two of them in each hand each one will

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.850 
two of them in each hand each one will
produce<00:00:52.829> three<00:00:53.370> paper<00:00:54.149> ninja<00:00:54.390> stars<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.350> need

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
produce three paper ninja stars now need

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
produce three paper ninja stars now need
to<00:00:56.010> focus<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:57.030> sheet<00:00:57.300> energy<00:00:57.780> released<00:00:58.289> from

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to focus your sheet energy released from

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.279 
to focus your sheet energy released from
your<00:00:58.590> hands<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.000> black<00:01:00.210> paper<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
your hands into the black paper so that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
your hands into the black paper so that
the<00:01:01.559> paper<00:01:01.770> releases<00:01:02.699> every<00:01:03.239> color<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the paper releases every color that it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
the paper releases every color that it
has<00:01:03.930> absorbed<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.369> black<00:01:05.640> after

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
has absorbed because it's black after

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
has absorbed because it's black after
holding<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> paper<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.590> 30<00:01:07.830> seconds<00:01:08.310> need<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
holding the paper for 30 seconds need to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
holding the paper for 30 seconds need to
understand<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:10.500> slowly<00:01:10.740> start<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
understand that it will slowly start to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
understand that it will slowly start to
change<00:01:11.700> color<00:01:12.030> however<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.380> able<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
change color however you all be able to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.060 
change color however you all be able to
see<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> colors

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
see this because because all the colors

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.179 
see this because because all the colors
will<00:01:17.189> still<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.670> within<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.210> black<00:01:18.450> paper

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
will still be within this black paper

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.300 
will still be within this black paper
which<00:01:20.189> means<00:01:21.110> they<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.259> also<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.040> even

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
which means they will also be there even

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
which means they will also be there even
though<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.759> has<00:01:23.939> been<00:01:24.150> released<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:25.049> its
