00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.570
 salam aleikoum to all this and gas and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.420
 damn what a long time ago 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.600
 we do not do by tarpaulins think that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.869
 it's been about three months 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 finally in a little hungry is two big 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.460
 Last month I made you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 it was late June seems to me on xbox 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 true it's been a long time just 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 web here is the gameplay you watch 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.510
 This is a pseudo word ap / Here blackops 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.550
 I did a series of 24 that he alarm 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.320
 I did two kills with mick and with 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 the helicopter I believe but in total I was 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 arrived at 26 or 27 0 so I have 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.079
 earned 7 in quotes moab on black 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 ops 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 then you are surely wondering 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 why it's been two and a half months 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 I did not ask you this video 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.219
 I will be frank with you I gave 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 explanation because you are entitled 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.600
 already 7 and holidays then me too 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 or maybe you too early 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 vacation I thought it would be 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.679
 the opportunity precisely to chain 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.329
 videos and everything but you have some 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.159
 thing had something else in mind actually 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.390
 because I personally do the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 it's part of my rhythm 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.939
 school 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380
 finally during the school year and where I 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.750
 go home I make myself a little 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 call of and all and then time in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 time I comment a video because it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.599
 makes me happy and it's nice to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.830
 please subscribers etc. 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.990
 but during the holidays you have 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.819
 really something else to think about that call 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.599
 of late end it depends some of between 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.149
 you it is 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's your hobby to doumé 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 personally it's not my trip to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.119
 do this during the holidays I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 really enjoyed spending time with 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.250
 my mates and everything is stalled in really 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.220
 close the cap 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.810
 so I stopped playing 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.550
 maybe 10 hours 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.350
 on the holidays more early I have 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.020
 really played only in lancet end of august 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.200
 that I understood I started playing again 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.850
 so here is now announce the return 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100
 from school and that allows me to make you 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.260
 this little video 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.200
 gold it was also a lack of envied 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.950
 obviously duo holidays that I'm going 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 not lie to you 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.840
 but now the fact that I do 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.790
 a ba it will revive a little machine 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.740
 if you know what I mean because 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.310
 that when I have moments where I have not 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.470
 I want to redo a video finally Ben 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.260
 it's a little slap it 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.390
 it had to me it gives me the thing and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 so it gives me courage at the end of 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.840
 courage is not really the word the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.540
 appropriate term but good and more 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.770
 finally because I have not played you go 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 tell me I still have gameplay in 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.670
 reserve it's true but the videos are 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.290
 no my life there are guys who think 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.690
 than that to make videos etc 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.100
 but if I force myself to make videos 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.830
 for sure you will find by the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.019
 nobody to find a guy who alas 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.120
 force yourself to make videos just not 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.310
 by principle 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.180
 while 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.909
 I think if you want to watch c 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.319
 surely for not you the gameplay to 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.840
 100% but that was a bit zero in front 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.840
 but hey if you want to watch it's 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.109
 also for me person and that of nico 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.389
 of course I think so much so wait 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.730
 better quality than quantity 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.439
 comedy 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.209
 in addition I have nettle problems so 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.709
 this video for example the rendering will only be 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.889
 not easy my computer i'm going to send it to 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.650
 nico for who publishes it tonight so 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.750
 today we are 6 nico elsewhere 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.489
 who is in my class this year at the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.700
 back in steyer and we are in the same 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.519
 class so that's funny I'm 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.709
 past will change a lot for you 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.730
 personally it's good for you 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.879
 point out because it's a 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.769
 little anecdote so today it's 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.100
 officially the first day of our 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.950
 two weeks 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.780
 with one video a day actually two 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.340
 levels had already started but as 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.410
 yesterday I did it saw that I was supposed 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.440
 to make a video that is not made on 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.790
 officially begins today this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.560
 kind of event it's not going to be all the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.750
 time we made it a sole 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.860
 we will do it two weeks now 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.540
 I do not think maybe during 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.160
 the year we will redo it is because 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.980
 it's still nice it depends on the 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.360
 back we're going to get but do not you 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.240
 do not wait if we are really a lot 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.310
 because it takes a lot of time 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.170
 more this year we are in the equivalent 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.890
 of the terminale in France so in rhéto 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.630
 in Belgium the 6th what will then be 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.890
 surely a little work anyway 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.720
 we will have less in 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.020
 even if I do not know if that's what will 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.210
 take me the most personal time I have 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 extracurricular sports activities and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.419
 all 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.680
 so this year I intend to invest 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.610
 even more in there I think that 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.690
 I did not say I think surely 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.259
 to isolate these kinds of things that 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.970
 get upset because people do that 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.340
 but I would probably have less 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.560
 time but still I will give myself 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.599
 thoroughly and you go out very videos 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.250
 regularly try to maintain this 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.080
 average of videos every three days 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.990
 two or three days so here is enjoy 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.090
 many of those two weeks I know the 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.229
 start now and I think we're going 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.159
 have a lot of fun together 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.039
 today it's still a video 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.360
 short but I hope to offer you 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:40.520
 long videos 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.629
 it's never then last thing of which 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.270
 I wanted to talk to you when was it 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:47.360
 even the fact that we soon reach 5000 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 subscribers so it's really super nice 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.430
 good 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.920
 we still have maybe 500 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.320
 active subscribers it's true that it's 5000 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.910
 subscribers does not mean much but 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.370
 despite all that remains a number one 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.900
 symbolic number rather I held 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.250
 really to thank you but you 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.750
 will see videos will be there will be at 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.950
 meet you to thank you that's okay 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.780
 to be of the high level 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.040
 so that's already the end of this 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.580
 video guys I hope you go 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.120
 kiffer put a little green thumb and 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.120
 here
