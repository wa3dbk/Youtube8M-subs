00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
recommend that you made it and you can

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.359 
recommend that you made it and you can
see<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> safe<00:01:25.799> spot<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.220> here

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
see that I have a safe spot over here

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
see that I have a safe spot over here
now<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> old<00:01:27.119> method<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.509> people<00:01:27.600> were

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
now the old method that people were

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
now the old method that people were
using<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.500> you'd<00:01:28.650> bring<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> partner

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
using was that you'd bring a partner

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.649 
using was that you'd bring a partner
with<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.000> stand<00:01:30.240> between<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
with you and it would stand between you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
with you and it would stand between you
and<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> boss<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.439> you'd<00:01:31.740> basically<00:01:31.890> just

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and the boss and you'd basically just

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.560 
and the boss and you'd basically just
far<00:01:32.340> cast<00:01:32.610> over<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> you'd<00:01:33.180> beat<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> boss

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
far cast over and you'd beat the boss

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.760 
far cast over and you'd beat the boss
pretty<00:01:33.840> quickly<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:34.650> your

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
pretty quickly and then when your

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.140 
pretty quickly and then when your
friends<00:01:35.040> turned<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> finish<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> boss<00:01:35.909> came

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
friends turned to finish the boss came

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
friends turned to finish the boss came
up<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.689> would<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> same<00:01:37.020> thing<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.409> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
up you would do the same thing for them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
up you would do the same thing for them
Jagex<00:01:38.460> actually<00:01:38.759> patched<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.150> recently<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
Jagex actually patched that recently so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
Jagex actually patched that recently so
you<00:01:39.630> can't<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.170> anymore<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:40.920> just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you can't do that anymore so I'm just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
you can't do that anymore so I'm just
showing<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.430> clip<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
showing you this clip how you can do it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.639 
showing you this clip how you can do it
without<00:01:42.360> taking<00:01:42.659> any<00:01:42.869> damage<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
without taking any damage now I was a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
without taking any damage now I was a
little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:43.950> sloppy<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.579> knew<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> had

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
little bit sloppy because I knew I had

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
little bit sloppy because I knew I had
enough<00:01:45.149> HP<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.659> enough<00:01:45.840> food<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.649> you're

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
enough HP and enough food but if you're

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.410 
enough HP and enough food but if you're
a<00:01:46.829> pure<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.280> almost<00:01:47.549> no<00:01:47.729> HP<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.270> could

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
a pure with almost no HP you could

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
a pure with almost no HP you could
probably<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.049> easily<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.130> next

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
probably do this pretty easily the next

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.590 
probably do this pretty easily the next

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750

stronghold and started doing some
agility<00:01:57.960> over<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.820> before<00:01:59.820> doing<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
actually looked up some quests that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
actually looked up some quests that
would<00:02:01.409> give<00:02:01.530> agility<00:02:01.710> experience<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.700> there

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
would give agility experience and there

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
would give agility experience and there
wasn't<00:02:03.060> anything<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.450> major<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.229> least

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
wasn't anything really major or at least

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.719 
wasn't anything really major or at least
anything<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.950> had<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> requirements<00:02:05.640> for

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
anything that I had the requirements for

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459 
anything that I had the requirements for
yet<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> decided<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
yet so I decided to do it over here and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.589 
yet so I decided to do it over here and
I<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.220> requirement<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.729> only<00:02:08.789> 25<00:02:09.360> levels

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
I know the requirement is only 25 levels

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.729 
I know the requirement is only 25 levels
but<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> way<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> 30

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
but I got it all the way up to 30

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
but I got it all the way up to 30
because<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.099> figured<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.430> after<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> agility

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
because I figured that after the agility

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.170 
because I figured that after the agility
reward<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.900> would

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
reward I would

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.520 
reward I would
from<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.390> grand<00:02:13.629> tree<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.200> would<00:02:14.349> probably

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
from the grand tree it would probably

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.559 
from the grand tree it would probably
take<00:02:14.799> me<00:02:14.829> up<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.069> 35<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.939> right<00:02:16.090> after<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.450> I'd

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
take me up to 35 so right after that I'd

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.940 
take me up to 35 so right after that I'd
be<00:02:16.659> able<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.900> hop<00:02:17.079> into<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.349> barbarian

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
be able to hop into the barbarian

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.009 
be able to hop into the barbarian

now<00:02:24.459> when<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> use<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.879> quest<00:02:25.120> before<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.480> used

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
now when I use the quest before I used

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390 
now when I use the quest before I used
to<00:02:25.810> read<00:02:25.989> all<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.439> dialogue<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.310> know

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.920 
to read all the dialogue and you know
get<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:27.909> into<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> quest<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.599> can<00:02:28.750> kind

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
get really into the quest so I can kind

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.330 
get really into the quest so I can kind
of<00:02:28.959> appreciate<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.590> storyline<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.129> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
of appreciate the storyline and the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.220 
of appreciate the storyline and the
experience<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.540> along<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.870> desert

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
experience so this along with desert

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.149 
experience so this along with desert
treasure<00:02:32.439> were<00:02:32.560> probably<00:02:32.769> two<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.069> my

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
treasure were probably two of my

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.380 
treasure were probably two of my
favorites<00:02:33.609> I<00:02:33.670> don't<00:02:33.819> know<00:02:33.879> why<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.269> one

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
favorites I don't know why this one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.970 
favorites I don't know why this one
stuck<00:02:34.599> with<00:02:34.720> me<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:34.900> particular<00:02:35.049> but<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.799> like

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
stuck with me in particular but I like

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.130 
stuck with me in particular but I like
it<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.159> lot<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.609> the<00:02:37.329> if<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.599> look<00:02:37.720> up<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.870> quest

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
it a lot so the if you look up a quest

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.300 
it a lot so the if you look up a quest
guide<00:02:38.349> it<00:02:38.500> actually<00:02:38.799> says<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.159> is<00:02:39.250> a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
guide it actually says that this is a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.619 
guide it actually says that this is a
long<00:02:39.489> quest<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:39.909> I<00:02:39.970> probably<00:02:40.209> did<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.510> in

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
long quest but I probably did this in

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.789 
long quest but I probably did this in
under<00:02:40.780> 30<00:02:41.049> minutes<00:02:41.140> since<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.590> remember

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
experience right now this is pretty

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.830 
experience right now this is pretty
surprising<00:03:39.699> considering<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.629> I<00:03:40.690> was

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
surprising considering that I was

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.330 
surprising considering that I was
expecting<00:03:41.319> cooking<00:03:41.590> or<00:03:41.709> fletching<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.159> be<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
expecting cooking or fletching to be the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.979 
expecting cooking or fletching to be the
first<00:03:42.519> 99<00:03:42.909> because<00:03:43.269> there's<00:03:43.479> they're

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
first 99 because there's they're

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.199 
first 99 because there's they're
arguably<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> fastest<00:03:45.069> skills<00:03:45.310> but<00:03:45.909> as<00:03:46.090> you

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
arguably the fastest skills but as you

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.159 
arguably the fastest skills but as you
can<00:03:46.329> see<00:03:46.479> I'm<00:03:46.540> going<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.690> go<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.840> fletching

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
can see I'm going to go to fletching

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.469 
can see I'm going to go to fletching
over<00:03:47.319> here<00:03:47.440> first<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.400> somebody<00:03:48.639> at<00:03:48.819> 97

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
over here first we have somebody at 97

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.479 
over here first we have somebody at 97
and<00:03:49.659> as<00:03:49.810> far<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.079> cooking<00:03:50.650> let<00:03:50.859> me<00:03:50.949> scroll<00:03:51.280> to

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
and as far as cooking let me scroll to

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.909 
and as far as cooking let me scroll to
that<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:52.180> right<00:03:53.139> over<00:03:53.260> there<00:03:53.440> we<00:03:53.889> owe

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
that and right over there we owe

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.099 
that and right over there we owe
somebody<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.609> got<00:03:54.760> 99<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.659> recently

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
somebody just got 99 just recently

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.899 
somebody just got 99 just recently
apparently<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.680> would<00:03:57.310> have<00:03:57.400> expected<00:03:57.609> them<00:03:57.879> to

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
apparently I would have expected them to

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.399 
apparently I would have expected them to
to<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.299> at<00:03:58.389> first<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.019> reason<00:03:59.260> why<00:03:59.349> it

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
to get at first but the reason why it

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.899 
to get at first but the reason why it
makes<00:03:59.739> sense<00:03:59.919> that<00:04:00.010> thieving<00:04:00.310> would<00:04:00.549> be<00:04:00.669> first

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
makes sense that thieving would be first

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.280 
makes sense that thieving would be first
is<00:04:01.060> because<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.419> doesn't<00:04:01.659> rely<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:01.870> people

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
is because it doesn't rely on people

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.770 
is because it doesn't rely on people
bringing<00:04:02.590> supplies<00:04:02.769> into<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.310> game<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.780> yeah

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
bringing supplies into the game so yeah

bringing supplies into the game so yeah

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719 
could see that I did gain a quite a few

agility<00:04:26.080> levels

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
agility levels

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.159 
agility levels
my<00:04:26.979> magic<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.460> think<00:04:27.669> was<00:04:27.850> six<00:04:28.419> last<00:04:28.720> time<00:04:28.960> and

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
my magic I think was six last time and

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.840 
my magic I think was six last time and
now<00:04:29.229> it's<00:04:29.440> all<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> way<00:04:29.710> up<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.040> twenty<00:04:30.759> five

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
now it's all the way up to twenty five

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.370 
now it's all the way up to twenty five
so<00:04:31.090> that's<00:04:31.180> pretty<00:04:31.389> good<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.840> also<00:04:31.870> got<00:04:32.259> up

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
so that's pretty good and I also got up

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.520 
so that's pretty good and I also got up
to<00:04:32.470> forty<00:04:32.710> two<00:04:32.830> attack<00:04:33.639> so<00:04:34.259> nothing<00:04:35.259> too<00:04:35.380> crazy

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
to forty two attack so nothing too crazy

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.870 
to forty two attack so nothing too crazy
it's<00:04:35.740> time<00:04:35.889> again<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.160> was<00:04:36.310> mostly<00:04:36.490> questing

so which I'm not too happy with I'm not
competing<00:04:44.830> for<00:04:45.009> ranks<00:04:45.370> but<00:04:45.520> it's<00:04:45.699> I<00:04:45.940> don't
