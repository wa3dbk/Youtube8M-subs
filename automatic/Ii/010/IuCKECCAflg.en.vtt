cover no covers very common and very
popular<00:01:39.710> game<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.400> like<00:01:40.550> here's<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.820> war

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
popular game so it is like here's a war

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.420 
popular game so it is like here's a war
has<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.050> we<00:01:42.619> took<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.160> wanted<00:01:43.369> to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
has it so we took that and wanted to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.310 
has it so we took that and wanted to
iterate<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.119> make<00:01:44.330> it<00:01:44.450> very<00:01:44.479> fast<00:01:44.930> action

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
iterate on that make it very fast action

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.990 
iterate on that make it very fast action
and<00:01:45.650> moving<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.039> between<00:01:46.250> curve<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.789> cover

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
and moving so between curve and cover

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.910 
and moving so between curve and cover
we've<00:01:47.509> got<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.690> nice<00:01:47.960> combination<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.649> gameplay

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
we've got a nice combination of gameplay

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.760 
we've got a nice combination of gameplay
mechanics<00:01:49.460> now<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:50.360> also<00:01:50.720> like<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.350> fact<00:01:51.380> when

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
mechanics now I also like the fact when

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.260

they<00:03:10.330> don't<00:03:10.510> understand<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.860> we<00:03:12.040> will

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
they don't understand it you we will

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.860 
they don't understand it you we will
lose<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.489> player<00:03:12.700> immediately<00:03:13.300> but<00:03:13.510> we<00:03:13.630> wanted

fun with it so I think we succeeded in
that<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.830> learn<00:03:21.100> how<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.370> curve<00:03:21.970> bullets<00:03:22.360> in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
that so learn how to curve bullets in

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.020 
that so learn how to curve bullets in
