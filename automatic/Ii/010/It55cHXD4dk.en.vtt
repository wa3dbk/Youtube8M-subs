rotation of a short hurdle and Apollo

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.270 
rotation of a short hurdle and Apollo
her<00:02:35.630> because<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.230> makes<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.709> different<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.160> at

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
all short hurdle attempts to rotate his

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.350 
all short hurdle attempts to rotate his
leg<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> faster<00:02:40.700> there's<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.940> tall<00:02:41.150> girl

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
leg and the faster there's a tall girl

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.210 
leg and the faster there's a tall girl
he's<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.290> end<00:02:42.410> up<00:02:42.530> hitting<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> hurdle

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
he's going to end up hitting the hurdle

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.970 
he's going to end up hitting the hurdle
and<00:02:43.670> another<00:02:43.970> thing<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.049> athlete

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and another thing is that if the athlete

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.610 
and another thing is that if the athlete
is<00:02:46.100> too<00:02:46.340> short<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.720> hot<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> UH<00:02:48.230> for

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
is too short for the hot for the UH for

a hurdle that's at a certain height

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.660 
a hurdle that's at a certain height
simply<00:02:51.320> load<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.530> hurdle<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.070> he<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:52.340> do<00:02:52.519> it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
simply load the hurdle so he can do it
