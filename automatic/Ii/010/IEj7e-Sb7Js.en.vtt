and modern warfare 3 the gameplays are
completely<00:00:42.250> random<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:44.350> think<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.620> this

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
completely random I just think that this

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.180 
completely random I just think that this
was<00:00:44.800> my<00:00:45.040> last<00:00:45.250> model<00:00:45.730> warfare<00:00:46.030> 3<00:00:46.300> gameplay'

was my last model warfare 3 gameplay'
footage<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:49.560> figured<00:00:50.560> might<00:00:50.890> as<00:00:50.920> well<00:00:51.130> use<00:00:51.430> it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
footage it figured might as well use it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.569 
footage it figured might as well use it
in<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:51.910> comparison<00:00:52.660> video<00:00:53.079> and<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.710> think<00:00:54.489> I

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
in this comparison video and I think I

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.819 
in this comparison video and I think I
was<00:00:54.700> trying<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.030> prove<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.360> point<00:00:55.710> while<00:00:56.710> the

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
was trying to prove a point while the

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.940 
was trying to prove a point while the
type<00:00:57.010> 95<00:00:57.810> particular<00:00:58.810> shot<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.380> dead<00:00:59.820> so

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
type 95 particular shot is dead so

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.389 
type 95 particular shot is dead so
showcasing<00:01:02.950> how<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.040> could<00:01:03.309> be<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.399> type

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.309 
any as well this is black ops 2 in in my
opinion<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.270> hit<00:02:21.450> detection<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.050> pretty

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
opinion the hit detection is pretty

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.410 
opinion the hit detection is pretty

this<00:06:43.380> year<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:43.890> I<00:06:44.340> think<00:06:44.640> the<00:06:44.730> gameplay<00:06:45.330> is

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
this year and I think the gameplay is

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.790 
this year and I think the gameplay is
just<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.810> lot<00:06:46.050> faster<00:06:46.590> and<00:06:46.800> it's<00:06:47.010> ever<00:06:47.190> been<00:06:48.800> so

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
just a lot faster and it's ever been so
