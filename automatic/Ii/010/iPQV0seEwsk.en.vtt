and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.030> enjoyed<00:00:48.269> using<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and I really enjoyed using it but I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.729 
and I really enjoyed using it but I
decided<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.819> new<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.389> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
decided to get a new one because the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
decided to get a new one because the
quality<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.519> padding<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.299> just<00:00:54.539> not

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
quality of this padding here just not

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.739 
quality of this padding here just not
very<00:00:54.899> good<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.409> also<00:00:56.339> one<00:00:57.030> problem<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.569> this

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
very good and also one problem with this

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.110 
very good and also one problem with this
type<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.019> mounts<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.429> when<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> mount

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
type of mounts is that when you mount

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.259 
type of mounts is that when you mount
this<00:01:00.329> onto<00:01:00.569> the<00:01:00.749> camera<00:01:01.249> see<00:01:02.249> where<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.639> screw

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
this onto the camera see where the screw

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.020 
this onto the camera see where the screw
is<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.799> bottom<00:01:04.979> side<00:01:05.309> when<00:01:05.969> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is for this at the bottom side when you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.480 
is for this at the bottom side when you
put<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> touch<00:01:06.539> on<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> tripod

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
put on a touch on a tripod

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.389 
put on a touch on a tripod
it<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.850> offsets<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> center<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
it actually offsets the center of the

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.580 
it actually offsets the center of the
camera<00:01:11.640> quite<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> bit<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.079> mount<00:01:13.289> it<00:01:13.439> on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
camera quite a bit so if you mount it on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.670 
camera quite a bit so if you mount it on
your<00:01:13.710> camera<00:01:14.030> now<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.240> tripod<00:01:15.780> mount<00:01:16.469> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
your camera now your tripod mount is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
your camera now your tripod mount is
over<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> side<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.719> made<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> camera

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
over to the side and that made a camera

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.399 
over to the side and that made a camera
very<00:01:19.469> unstable<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.930> why<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.109> decided

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
very unstable so that's why I decided

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
very unstable so that's why I decided
get<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> new<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.969> but<00:01:23.969> I<00:01:24.030> would<00:01:24.270> strongly

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
get a new one but I would strongly

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.060 
get a new one but I would strongly
advise<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.829> not<00:01:25.859> to<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.640> style<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
advise you not to get this style of a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.490 
advise you not to get this style of a
mount<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.490> hand<00:01:29.729> strap<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.289> new

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.279 
mount for the hand strap now with a new
one<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> quality<00:01:33.359> is<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:33.780> better<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
one the quality is much better it

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.770 
one the quality is much better it
actually<00:01:34.619> has<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.159> foam<00:01:35.909> padding<00:01:36.359> on<00:01:36.539> the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.270 
backside
this<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.490> has<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.960> Velcro<00:01:40.820> okay<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:44.009> mount

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this one has a Velcro okay and the mount

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
this one has a Velcro okay and the mount
underneath<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> camera<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.469> where<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
underneath the camera this is where it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.609 
underneath the camera this is where it
screws<00:01:46.979> onto<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> bottom<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> camera<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
screws onto the bottom of the camera and

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.919 
screws onto the bottom of the camera and
the<00:01:49.619> tripod<00:01:50.070> mount<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.390> install<00:01:51.719> this

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
the tripod mount up you install this

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.349 
the tripod mount up you install this
it's<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:53.039> next<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.179> it<00:01:54.299> doesn't

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
it's just right next to it so it doesn't

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.419 
it's just right next to it so it doesn't
offset<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> weight<00:01:55.499> of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> camera<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:56.219> much

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
offset the weight of the camera too much

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.749 
offset the weight of the camera too much
and<00:01:57.270> also<00:01:57.960> has<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> rubber<00:01:58.469> backing<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.700> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and also has a rubber backing here so it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.779 
and also has a rubber backing here so it
won't<00:01:59.850> slip<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.780> move<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.429> adjust

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
won't slip and move around now to adjust

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.859 
won't slip and move around now to adjust
this<00:02:03.270> basically<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.859> you<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.869> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this basically when you get this you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
this basically when you get this you
pull<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> straps

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
pull out the straps

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.649 
pull out the straps
on<00:02:09.450> both<00:02:09.629> sides<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.260> then<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:14.510> take<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
on both sides and then you can take this

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.580 
on both sides and then you can take this
out<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.670> loop<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> adjust<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.409> length

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
out of the loop and adjust the length

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.820 
out of the loop and adjust the length
