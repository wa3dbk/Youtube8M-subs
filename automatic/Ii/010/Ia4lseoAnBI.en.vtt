00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.490 
three miles don't do that this is this
is<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.540> need<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.079> need<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is what you need to do you need to do it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
is what you need to do you need to do it
for<00:01:58.680> time<00:01:58.890> say<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> run<00:01:59.729> for<00:01:59.759> 30

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
for time say I'm going to run for 30

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
for time say I'm going to run for 30
minutes<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.350> run<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.649> same<00:02:01.979> pace<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.460> 30

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
minutes and you run the same pace for 30

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.230 
minutes and you run the same pace for 30
minutes

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
minutes

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
minutes
don't<00:02:03.570> stop<00:02:03.899> thing<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.009> lot<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> running

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
don't stop thing is a lot of the running

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.460 
don't stop thing is a lot of the running
is<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.380> solo<00:02:07.770> run

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
is it's not a solo run

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.710 
is it's not a solo run
with<00:02:08.680> your<00:02:08.920> with<00:02:09.490> your<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.090> platoon<00:02:10.479> and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
with your with your you know platoon and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.930 
with your with your you know platoon and
everything<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:12.040> you're<00:02:12.310> only<00:02:12.400> running<00:02:12.820> as

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
everything so you're only running as

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
everything so you're only running as
fast<00:02:13.210> as<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.900> fastest<00:02:14.380> queue<00:02:14.560> does<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> slowest

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
fast as the fastest queue does a slowest

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.910 
fast as the fastest queue does a slowest
person<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.300> you're<00:02:17.140> not<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.710> be

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
person so you're not really going to be

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.790 
person so you're not really going to be
busting<00:02:18.820> out<00:02:18.970> three<00:02:19.360> miles<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.020> know<00:02:20.170> 19

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
busting out three miles and you know 19

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.590 
busting out three miles and you know 19
minutes<00:02:21.070> you're<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.910> running<00:02:22.090> three

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
minutes you're going to be running three

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.740 
minutes you're going to be running three
miles<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.860> know<00:02:24.010> 35<00:02:24.730> minutes<00:02:25.360> 40<00:02:25.720> minutes

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
miles in you know 35 minutes 40 minutes

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.970 
miles in you know 35 minutes 40 minutes
who<00:02:26.440> knows

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
who knows

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.340 
who knows
so<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.520> thing<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.880> if<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.150> practice<00:02:29.050> running

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
so the thing is if you practice running

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.340 
so the thing is if you practice running
for<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> longer<00:02:30.670> period<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.090> time<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:32.140> going

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
for a longer period of time it's going

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.170 
for a longer period of time it's going
to<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.530> easier<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.880> people

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
to be easier for you because the people

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820 
to be easier for you because the people
who<00:02:34.270> can<00:02:34.420> run<00:02:34.600> these<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.170> know<00:02:35.290> three<00:02:35.620> miles

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
who can run these you know three miles

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.460 
who can run these you know three miles
whatnot<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.760> know<00:02:36.790> ridiculously<00:02:37.780> fast<00:02:38.140> time

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
whatnot you know ridiculously fast time

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.830 
whatnot you know ridiculously fast time
they've<00:02:39.280> never<00:02:39.490> really<00:02:39.730> ran<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.660> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
they've never really ran that for that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.480 
they've never really ran that for that
long<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.320> they<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.650> hard<00:02:41.920> time<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.370> know

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
long so they have a hard time you know

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.640 
long so they have a hard time you know
keeping<00:02:42.850> up<00:02:43.000> or<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.330> know<00:02:43.480> towards<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.470> end

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
keeping up or you know towards the end

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
keeping up or you know towards the end
that<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> long<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.730> know<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.820> hard<00:02:46.180> time

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that I have a long you know a hard time

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.390 
that I have a long you know a hard time
it's<00:02:46.959> my<00:02:47.140> advice<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.860> sit<00:02:47.980> there<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.220> say

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it's my advice is just sit there and say

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.910 
it's my advice is just sit there and say
I'm<00:02:48.520> gonna<00:02:48.670> run<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:48.880> 30<00:02:49.300> minutes<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.920> just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I'm gonna run for 30 minutes and just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920 
I'm gonna run for 30 minutes and just

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
run for that disc that amount of time

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.410 
run for that disc that amount of time
don't<00:02:53.350> worry<00:02:53.530> about<00:02:53.620> distance<00:02:54.220> don't<00:02:55.209> worry

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420

don't worry about distance don't worry
about<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.900> PT<00:02:56.320> test<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.770> easy<00:02:56.890> you'll<00:02:57.310> have

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
about that PT test is easy you'll have

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.340 
about that PT test is easy you'll have
no<00:02:57.580> problems<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.330> once<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.020> get<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.320> that

no problems with it once you get to that

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.790 
no problems with it once you get to that
