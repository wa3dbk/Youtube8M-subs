00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 The SÃ£o Paulo Stock Exchange is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 among the world's top five exchanges 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.200
 but this year 2013 presents the lowest 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.450
 performance among the major stock exchanges 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.009
 and it is on this subject that I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030
 I convert now to clodoir economist 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.740
 scallop 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.510
 when he because the Brazilian stock exchange has 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.260
 perform so poorly in relation to the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.689
 others 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.050
 looks at the other really 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 so it's too big you pick up the index 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 dow jones nasa is very positive 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 How much in Brazil is close to 20% 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.809
 very negative presence then very large 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 in relation to the other 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.940
 this sharp drop in the stock market is so in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 government discredited even in this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.640
 research shows that our president 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.980
 is in decline of popularity 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 the rallies influenced already came 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.750
 influencing the discrete in the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 government is knocking down the price of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 handbag 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.989
 in relation to the alien's departure also 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.000
 going back to origins and not talking mother 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.129
 united states back to origins 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 it also knocks over because they 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.330
 sell stocks in Brazil will do 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 positioning in other countries 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.710
 I say until today money does not have 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 he sleeps in a country and wakes up in the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.200
 other the ibovespa in low with the bag 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 without the actions at lower prices is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 the time the investor enters the market 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.229
 of actions 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.070
 Look, I would say the following 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.170
 historically all strong falls 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 who are now in disrepute with the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 period she has a recovery the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 years is thus an average of one year 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.549
 and two years of a strong fall to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.259
 bag recover back to the levels 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.640
 I would say the following is a time of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.770
 Caution even more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.380
 It is interesting to choose some 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.720
 companies and make positions mainly 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.670
 exporters at the moment do some 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.950
 positions because if the world economy 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 exporters will grow again if they 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.119
 recover faster than internal ones 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.689
 that domestic workers fell less than the economy 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.009
 domestic 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.680
 who has little money that companies 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.329
 should look look i would say that those who 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.159
 has little money he would have to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.640
 choose some companies that are good 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.950
 paying dividends in this case you 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.690
 have tractebel you have the souza cruz 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 There are some people who do not like it, huh? 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.569
 have ambev 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.830
 then these companies are excellent 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.170
 payers of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.060
 dividends and in a moment of crisis they 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.670
 suffer less than others do not 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.010
 fall sufferers - who has enough money 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 can look what is pleasure being look me 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.560
 I would say that we both want money 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.510
 one part of risk and another not to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.580
 I would say that the funds 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.540
 real estate are having one is a 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.870
 Good profitability is and actions I would say 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.270
 go to big companies until 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.730
 would exclude petrobras and the other 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.350
 large companies as a bank would be a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.000
 good investment opportunity the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.340
 exporters are benefiting from 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.190
 because of the high dollar and the high dollar 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 has benefited exporters is that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 economy is not helping yet. 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.880
 plus the United States recovering as 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.180
 we are seeing a recovery in 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.130
 American economy to this will give 11 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660
 could give gas in companies 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.060
 exporters which is the main 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.360
 Thank you very much, our customer. 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.360
