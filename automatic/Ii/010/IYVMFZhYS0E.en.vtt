00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
was at about like 7.2 seconds when he

because Colin's running and sees that

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.070 
because Colin's running and sees that
Richard<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.100> in<00:04:27.160> front<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.030> his<00:04:28.450> wide<00:04:28.630> receiver

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080

and yet still throws the ball low and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.320 
and yet still throws the ball low and
inside<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:32.620> just<00:04:32.650> doesn't<00:04:33.490> make<00:04:33.640> sense<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.210> me

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
inside it just doesn't make sense to me

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.110
