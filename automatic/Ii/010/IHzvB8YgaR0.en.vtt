00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.989
 hi girls i start my makeup for 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.320
 lancom with 3 0 and this is one 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.449
 pen concealer illuminating this me 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.250
 like to spread out on the area of ​​the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.710
 eye contour precisely to illuminate it 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.329
 look remove any dark circles e 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.909
 as always I apply it triangular shape 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.239
 from the area under the eye to the 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:45.250
 nose data then faded for good 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.930
 all and passed to the foundation this 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
 very new foundation is very 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.939
 detail with the sponge just point 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.699
 believe on it and then with the sponge 

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.409
 I'm going to tap the whole face 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.670
 and has a very very natural effect 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.850
 I have to say I don't usually like to use 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.920
 the sponges of the packages but this one 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.839
 I was amazed I have to tell you why you didn't 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.450
 he saw on and is very very light 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.790
 so I'm going to spread it all over my face 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.590
 tapping and fading well 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.950
 always towards the neck and on the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 hairline and now I go to 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.049
 fix my base naturally with the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.789
 face powder this is a colored powder but it is 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.520
 very clear so it's perfect for the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.649
 my complexion and I go from just 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.329
 apply with a large brush from then 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.969
 true for the face especially insisting 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.719
 on the area t especially in the summer me 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:37.929
 understand and then switched to hypnos eyeshadow 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:41.499
 are you this is an eye shadow the pencil 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.320
 it's great for summer because you don't 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.630
 moves there is there 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.479
 super super pigmented very easy to use 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.190
 to fade is indeed applied 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 simply even with the title not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.590
 no need to use brushes if I stretch it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.720
 on the eyelid and then in the corner 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:06.560
 inside up and under the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:09.690
 eyebrow then faded all right 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.220
 and now I pass this eyeliner this yes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.959
 called liner clown and is an eyeliner 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.610
 special because completely white and 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.220
 white really like milk a lot 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 very writing and serving can be used in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.060
 many different ways to illuminate 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.680
 the look to open it to make them 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.989
 seem to make your eyes look more 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 great I want to create a look today with 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.440
 double eyeliner so I'm going to roll out 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.380
 a beautiful line itself than in mine 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 white eyeliner and also because then 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.739
 we are going to apply ourselves on the eyeliner 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.360
 black therefore must be beautiful itself 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.930
 because then it won't be so big 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.690
 you will see and go create even a continue 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.030
 quite obvious 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 and then false to the art liner this 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.120
 never black liner 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.770
 this is also very easy to apply 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.180
 because it is not does not have the classic 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 Liquid eyeliner brush is almost a 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.460
 a little more eyeliner than a felt-tip pen 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.410
 simple I go to draw a long line 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.930
 the lashes along the hanging of the dinners 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.700
 naturally thinner than in 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.790
 the white one we created so 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 that you see both colors and long 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.590
 and codeine indeed almost until now 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.590
 they went with HIV and AIDS 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.130
 This is a purple plum purple plum and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.590
 this color can make you exempt a lot 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 the colors the light eyes then green 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.300
 from my eyes I go to apply it long 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.599
 the whole area along all the lashes 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.280
 lower and also in the internal rhyme e 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.680
 then I go to blend with a small brush 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.819
 so tiny I go to a felt- tip pen 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.189
 vanish 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.469
 all the whole line we have 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.469
 created with our tourist brands 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 relationship is a bit down that 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.270
 to 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.040
 but so that it is an effect more 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.680
 natural 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.780
 and then we finally move on to fitness 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.700
 I want but for you this brand new 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.859
 mascara that has an applicator that me 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.079
 I love prefixing icons and not creating ngoni 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.549
 it's really a past light they leave you 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.989
 stands with lots of volume 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.879
 I'm sorry you can't see it 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.530
 on my cinemas you know that the extension 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.180
 but you can see the before and after 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209
 on the lower lashes than really 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.009
 something phenomenal and it's also a lot 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.320
 simple to apply actually not 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.660
 you have to do too many passes because 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.370
 just as well a pasta for perfect if 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.930
 have you tried this mascara do me 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.330
 always in the comments that are curious la 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.310
 Mass by doing a lot and now I pass 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.660
 of course to the splendid hilton slack 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.570
 I also like the flesh-colored 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.000
 packaging of these blush and I go to 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.669
 lay it out, of course, where 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.550
 we spend the blush surprised and with a 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.940
 small powder brush for the 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.479
 face and now we finally move on to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.370
 lips 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.169
 this is a beautiful lipstick from 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.060
 summer collection has a color 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.550
 beautiful you see the color once 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.870
 lying does not drool and lasts a lot vi 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.780
 I must say that this surprised me 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.690
 however, lipstick is translucent 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.280
 very glossy, very summery, they are 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.780
 for the summer season I like them very much 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.990
 these colors do not have to be too much 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.430

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.430
