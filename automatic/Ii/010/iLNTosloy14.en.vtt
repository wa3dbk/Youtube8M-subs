00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.430
 monsanto and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 a new episode of the text tutorials 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.059
 today it's rubber so rubber and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 number as the at the pumpkin he has the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.660
 stand down now very short time for this to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.100
 to show that today is at 31 o'clock 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.869
 halloween so now i have to go 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 I would go over like that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.619
 every time I come here in this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 little house like me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.780
 it will not do that very well 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.899
 because we happen to have ever seen a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 I did not know standing 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.300
 call these trees drama the tree here 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 which translates and translates gum tree 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 and find the chambers in swamp ears 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 but also in Triesenberg like this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.660
 back by still not good but 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.960
 often are in any case in the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 swamp the young take us once 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 accurate subject under magnifying glass 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.460
 we are taking now times completely was 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.840
 creative go out and us and us 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:23.149
 times the gourds look the branches 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.979
 next to very short wood I just wanted to go 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:30.860
 So take us then take us once 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:33.289
 very short the boards and now have 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.459
 a rafting box is a normal one 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.549
 and take a little wood from it 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.380
 make that out of that and that 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.789
 make it what my wood chops that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 will last for today 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.539
 now I must of course sometimes quite 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.110
 served here make that's probably 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.909
 now with time 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:02.509
 Now let's take a look at the following and 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:06.069
 Although the line and as you can see 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.069
 because something just fell out 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.890
 which has the basic that I the not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.349
 build and wait for a while 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.209
 Two seedlings fell out 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.299
 that it is quite normal over other trees 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.069
 plants and the new trees like the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.200
 for example and there but again 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.560
 reforested and then we have this 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.730
 funny is sticky resin here what is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 the kias sticky I forgot so 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.590
 that karmann place and then you have 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.049
 short on the floor 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.010
 yes of course you can break down again and 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.400
 you will never have that again 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.230
 yes, what's the matter with me? 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.230
 of course I 'm going to an oven now 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.069
 Of course I do not have that again 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.260
 I had once briefly look oven oven on 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.380
 the iss determined here all at once very 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.380
 but I do not open it and one 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.690
 similar to coal coal 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.350
 I was worried before that but that is 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.290
 it does not matter now 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.080
 Let's do something and pack that 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.840
 it just takes a while to do that 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.840
 is now something very specific Sun 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.810
 tribe 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.710
 now we may have here but of 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 a primary school is actually 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.320
 It would be considered an eraser 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.430
 hot was actually loose sum so that 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.010
 Rubber and rubber are needed 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.890
 not much to say rubber 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:51.480
 important stuff that you can use 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:55.010
 or use, so to speak, for some 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.420
 things and that with some a few many 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.320
 and that means you always have to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.400
 bit you have to go deeper and deeper 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.260
 let's play by myself, I'll be on everyone 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.360
 even such a swamp company 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.709
 I actually have to search for it 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.900
 no other choice and now you need 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.950
 I'm copper again that's not quite 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.940
 important kopper have to do so and then 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.800
 we will take this as follows 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.320
 6 3 6 and 3 kopper and we have six 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.390
 copper cable copper cable that he the the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.510
 we have used before 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.060
 For this device you need it 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.040
 always not only for power line but 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.229
 for many devices 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.210
 I can not list all of them 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.280
 but there is definitely enough and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.290
 you always have to but we know 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.820
 you also in the form already quite 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.050
 useful if you do that for many things 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.180
 needs and well says you told yourself 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.910
 already rubber and cable with 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.530
 rubber veh so it is clear 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.740
 Now there is something else 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.360
 Of course the harvest is always something 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.240
 arduous why take wood 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800
 in this form you as I do that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.690
 that works with every wood 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.770
 his boards are clear and then 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.889
 you get a kick 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.580
 So we take this type of school and do it 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.020
 right click on those weird spots 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.840
 Did we do that first? 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.629
 team and three at the same time 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.120
 other risks got that means the 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.789
 harvest is so you reap much 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.280
 more effective if you share these parts 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.900
 degrading as it is not always here 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.509
 depending on that you always have a bit 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.840
 there are still some which I believe 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.000
 I've just seen something 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.930
 nice we look past we have 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.330
 So by 1.2 to get out how it works 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.250
 this discount riis will definitely be 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.380
 I always wanted to be so important 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.780
 make short tutorial makes it easy times 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.780
 It does not take long for you to do so 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.310
 knows what that's all about because at the beginning 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.080
 I also have a little equipment myself 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.879
 It does not have to be but I have forever 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.379
 wanted and everything and I hope that 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.509
 The tips now bring a little something 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.690
 so you to come because things faster 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.370
 do not look big under teck wiki 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.199
 and read everything is because it is 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.560
 yes also in English and me 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.550
 By the way, not so 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.510
 Of course you can do the following 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.770
 and they just sit in the ground 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.570
 and then pretend that you are short 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.460
 yes, that was all this tutorial 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.870
 and not one will say until the 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.870
 next time people shot
