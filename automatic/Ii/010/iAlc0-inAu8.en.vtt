certain layers

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.290 
certain layers
be<00:01:13.380> very<00:01:13.710> gentle<00:01:13.830> though<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:14.730> taking<00:01:15.120> them

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
be very gentle though when taking them

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.210 
be very gentle though when taking them
off<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> brace<00:01:15.810> plates<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.530> start<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.920> next

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
off the brace plates to start the next

off the brace plates to start the next
layers<00:01:17.510> here<00:01:18.510> you'll<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.050> where<00:01:19.200> those<00:01:19.350> brown

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
layers here you'll see where those brown

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
layers here you'll see where those brown
pieces<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.790> come<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> handy
