readers what's going on inside here so

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.619 
readers what's going on inside here so
what<00:00:04.859> we've<00:00:04.980> got<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.549> we<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.509> this

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
what we've got is we have in this

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.230 
what we've got is we have in this
particular<00:00:06.839> bulb<00:00:07.440> 10<00:00:07.940> warm<00:00:08.940> white<00:00:09.179> LEDs<00:00:10.139> and

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
particular bulb 10 warm white LEDs and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
particular bulb 10 warm white LEDs and
the<00:00:12.240> LEDs<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.080> grant<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> other<00:00:13.710> bull<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.099> I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the LEDs and grant this other bull so I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
the LEDs and grant this other bull so I
can<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.580> show<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.540> LEDs<00:00:15.870> are<00:00:16.020> mounted

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
can just show it the LEDs are mounted

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.580 
can just show it the LEDs are mounted
inside<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.980> lamp<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.750> they<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.869> powered<00:00:19.289> by

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
inside the lamp and they are powered by

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
inside the lamp and they are powered by
the<00:00:19.619> driver<00:00:20.070> which<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.880> mounted<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> screw

base<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> LEDs<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:24.510> driven<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
base the LEDs are then driven to the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
base the LEDs are then driven to the
full<00:00:26.039> brightness<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
full brightness that you can get out of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.359 
full brightness that you can get out of
them<00:00:27.599> because<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> cooling<00:00:28.890> solution

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
them because of the cooling solution

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.339 
them because of the cooling solution
we've<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.699> within<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.240> light<00:00:30.420> bulb<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we've got within the light bulb this

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
we've got within the light bulb this
light<00:00:31.650> bulb<00:00:31.920> creates<00:00:32.369> its<00:00:32.610> own<00:00:32.700> self<00:00:33.329> cooling

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
light bulb creates its own self cooling

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
light bulb creates its own self cooling
environment<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> self<00:00:35.520> cooling

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
environment and that self cooling

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
environment and that self cooling
environment<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:36.690> passive<00:00:37.230> there's<00:00:37.500> no

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
environment that's passive there's no

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130

allows<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> LEDs<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.309> provide<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.850> maximum

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
allows the LEDs to provide the maximum

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
allows the LEDs to provide the maximum
amount<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.989> brightness<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.980> get

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
amount of brightness that you can get

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
amount of brightness that you can get
out<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> still<00:00:45.809> maintain<00:00:46.140> their

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
out of them and still maintain their

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
out of them and still maintain their
long<00:00:47.250> life<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.149> put<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.420> power<00:00:48.629> into

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
long life so you can put more power into

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
long life so you can put more power into
the<00:00:48.989> LEDs<00:00:49.410> crank<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.210> can

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the LEDs crank them up because you can

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
the LEDs crank them up because you can
actually<00:00:51.360> cool<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> glass<00:00:52.379> exact<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
actually cool with the glass exact and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
actually cool with the glass exact and
most<00:00:53.370> people<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> clue<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.300> most

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
most people just clue you know most

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
most people just clue you know most
bulbs<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.559> cool<00:00:55.770> through<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> alumina

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

heats<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> correct<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.050> cool

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
heats of correct right so now it's cool

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.510 
heats of correct right so now it's cool
it<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> glass<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:58.920> crank<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it on the glass you can crank up the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.270 
it on the glass you can crank up the
power<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> drivers<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:00.989> base

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
like an incandescent so you can sit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
like an incandescent so you can sit
under<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.070> read<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
under it and read from it just like you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.420 
under it and read from it just like you
can<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> regular<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.770> Canada<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
can with a regular in Canada there's a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.530 
can with a regular in Canada there's a
lot<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> both<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:32.909> figure<00:01:33.030> look<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> bulb

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
lot of both will figure look at the bulb

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.580 
lot of both will figure look at the bulb
again<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> them<00:01:34.439> actually

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
again there's a lot of them actually

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
again there's a lot of them actually
don't<00:01:34.890> come<00:01:35.070> down<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> whole<00:01:35.939> curve<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.420> mean

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
don't come down the whole curve I mean

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't come down the whole curve I mean
actually<00:01:36.900> might<00:01:37.049> style<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.829> look<00:01:38.130> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
actually might style there there look at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.670 
actually might style there there look at
most<00:01:38.460> LED<00:01:38.939> bulbs<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> LEDs<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.049> mounted<00:01:40.380> flat

on the aluminum base and LEDs act like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
on the aluminum base and LEDs act like
little<00:01:43.320> flashlights<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.430> means<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
little flashlights which means that the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.690 
little flashlights which means that the
light<00:01:45.149> goes<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:46.170> direction<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.920> which

light goes in one direction up which

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.609 
light goes in one direction up which
means<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> very<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.780> light<00:01:49.020> comes<00:01:49.350> down

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
means that very little light comes down

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
means that very little light comes down
most<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> light<00:01:50.759> goes<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.210> the

the light going down that's here luthias

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
the light going down that's here luthias
look<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.430> usable<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.149> lighting<00:02:00.420> up

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
look that's not usable your lighting up

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.600 
look that's not usable your lighting up
the<00:02:00.630> incredible<00:02:01.079> bulk<00:02:01.250> okay<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.430> right

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the incredible bulk okay that's right

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.709 
the incredible bulk okay that's right
but<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.090> actually<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.509> because

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
but right here actually there because

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.010 
but right here actually there because
they're<00:02:03.899> they're<00:02:04.350> mounted<00:02:04.710> vertically<00:02:05.340> right

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
they're they're mounted vertically right

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.999 
they're they're mounted vertically right
they're<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.320> streaming<00:02:07.590> light<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
they're actually streaming light out and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
they're actually streaming light out and
there's<00:02:08.369> optics<00:02:08.819> within<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> actually

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
there's optics within that to actually

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
there's optics within that to actually
smooth<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.289> don't<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.709> effort

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
smooth out they don't see for effort

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.460 
smooth out they don't see for effort
you<00:02:11.280> ask<00:02:11.730> around<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.050> here's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.320> kicker

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you ask around to and here's the kicker

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
you ask around to and here's the kicker
yes<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:15.000> well<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> glass<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.750> special

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
yes it's not well the glass is special

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.480 
yes it's not well the glass is special
but<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.410> glass<00:02:16.710> that's<00:02:17.040> cooling

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
but it's not the glass that's cooling

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.050 
but it's not the glass that's cooling
those<00:02:18.450> LEDs<00:02:19.190> yeah<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.460> what's<00:02:20.670> happening

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
those LEDs yeah so what's happening

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
those LEDs yeah so what's happening
inside<00:02:21.390> we've<00:02:21.630> got<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.900> beautiful

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
inside we've got this beautiful

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.600 
inside we've got this beautiful
environmental<00:02:22.830> cooling<00:02:23.130> solution<00:02:23.490> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
environmental cooling solution that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.700 
environmental cooling solution that
happens<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> liquid<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.350> benign

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
happens to be a liquid it's a benign

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.160 
happens to be a liquid it's a benign
liquid<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.310> inside<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.910> lamp<00:02:27.360> somebody

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
liquid that's inside the lamp somebody

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.600 
liquid that's inside the lamp somebody
actually<00:02:28.380> said<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.890> looks<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> lava<00:02:29.490> lamp

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually said it looks like a lava lamp

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.670 
actually said it looks like a lava lamp
but<00:02:30.600> obviously<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.960> can't<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> liquid

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
but obviously you can't see the liquid

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
but obviously you can't see the liquid
and<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:33.030> liquid<00:02:33.060> actually<00:02:33.780> circulates

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and the liquid actually circulates

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.140 
and the liquid actually circulates
within<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.920> light<00:02:35.070> bulb<00:02:35.310> automatically<00:02:35.970> as

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
within the light bulb automatically as

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.450 
within the light bulb automatically as
it<00:02:36.330> heats<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.960> takes<00:02:37.920> heat<00:02:38.100> away<00:02:38.190> from<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
it heats up and takes heat away from the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.070 
it heats up and takes heat away from the
LEDs<00:02:38.820> brings<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> surface<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
LEDs brings it to the surface of the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440 
LEDs brings it to the surface of the
glass<00:02:40.730> releases<00:02:41.730> its<00:02:41.880> heat<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.270> surface

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
glass releases its heat to the surface

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
glass releases its heat to the surface
of<00:02:42.720> glass<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.140> cools<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> LEDs<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:44.730> not

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
of glass and cools the LEDs so it's not

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.700 
of glass and cools the LEDs so it's not
going<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.560> from

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
going up and down it's it's going from

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.650 
going up and down it's it's going from
the<00:02:46.800> led<00:02:47.100> out<00:02:47.430> toward<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.030> surface<00:02:48.210> mcglasson

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.110 
the led out toward the surface mcglasson
circulating<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.650> yeah<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.250> passive

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
circulating back in yeah so passive

to it's going to electrocute me well the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.550 
to it's going to electrocute me well the
fluid<00:03:08.760> we're<00:03:08.910> using<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.570> an<00:03:10.050> off-the-shelf

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
fluid we're using is an off-the-shelf

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.680 
fluid we're using is an off-the-shelf
fluid<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.130> very<00:03:11.340> inexpensive<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
fluid that's very inexpensive it is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.620 
fluid that's very inexpensive it is
fully<00:03:13.110> electrically<00:03:13.800> insulative<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.390> does

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
fully electrically insulative so it does

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.930 
fully electrically insulative so it does

to operate at its maximum efficiency
that's<00:03:36.840> exactly<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.740> same<00:03:37.950> thing<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.580> are

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
that's exactly the same thing as we are

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.550 
that's exactly the same thing as we are
doing<00:03:38.880> here<00:03:39.270> we<00:03:39.450> are<00:03:39.750> bathing<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.170> LEDs<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
doing here we are bathing the LEDs and

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.590 
doing here we are bathing the LEDs and
fluid<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.550> allow<00:03:41.760> them<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.060> operate<00:03:42.150> at<00:03:42.480> their

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
maximum efficiency beeping others I've

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.900 
maximum efficiency beeping others I've
try<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.060> or<00:03:45.380> they<00:03:46.380> may<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.850> some

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
try to do that or they may we have some

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.820 
try to do that or they may we have some
intellectual<00:03:48.690> property<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.230> course<00:03:49.470> that

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
intellectual property of course that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.890 
intellectual property of course that
protects<00:03:50.489> what<00:03:50.670> we're<00:03:50.820> doing<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.660> think

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
protects what we're doing and I think

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.630 
protects what we're doing and I think
we're<00:03:52.050> pretty<00:03:52.200> rock<00:03:52.470> solid<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
we're pretty rock solid in that so I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880 
we're pretty rock solid in that so I
don't<00:03:53.910> see<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.270> as<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.600> big<00:03:54.810> issue<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.770> other

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
don't see that as a big issue the other

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.199 
don't see that as a big issue the other
thing<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.100> should<00:03:56.130> mention<00:03:56.280> about<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> fluid

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
thing I should mention about the fluid

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.229 
thing I should mention about the fluid
is<00:03:57.330> if<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.440> light<00:03:58.590> bulb<00:03:58.830> should<00:03:59.040> break<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.610> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
is if the light bulb should break and it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.420 
is if the light bulb should break and it
will<00:04:00.420> actually<00:04:00.570> drop<00:04:00.989> from<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.380> three<00:04:01.830> foot<00:04:02.040> you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
will actually drop from a three foot you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.710 
will actually drop from a three foot you
could<00:04:02.580> drop<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:02.970> three<00:04:03.150> feet<00:04:03.330> middle<00:04:03.600> but

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
could drop at three feet middle but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.600 
could drop at three feet middle but
without<00:04:04.050> breaking<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.040> if<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.250> should<00:04:05.400> break

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
without breaking but if it should break

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.340 
without breaking but if it should break
it<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.910> cleans<00:04:06.090> off<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.360> open<00:04:06.630> water<00:04:06.810> ok

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
it just cleans off this open water ok

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.600 
it just cleans off this open water ok
right<00:04:07.650> now<00:04:08.010> one<00:04:08.160> thing<00:04:08.190> though<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.580> because

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
right now one thing though is because

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.209 
right now one thing though is because
you
