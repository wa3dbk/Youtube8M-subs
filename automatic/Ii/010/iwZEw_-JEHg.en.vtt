00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.720
 but in a very simple way with 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:13.440
 really very few moves a little 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.139
 floret on rebuilt street this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.260

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.750
 moves 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.820
 then you must first have a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.020
 small brush with oblique tip 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 previously you will have prepared i 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.020
 colors 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 I use these of the lady in the ok 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.250

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250
 put a little zoom 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790
 I hope you see something 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.680
 go and make small petals 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.070

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.909
 little flower and it took me very little 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.879
 less than practically a minute 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.110
