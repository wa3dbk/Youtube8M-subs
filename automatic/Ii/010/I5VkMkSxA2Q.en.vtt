ennis<00:01:37.770> hundley<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.340> Huntley<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.090> one

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
ennis hundley and as Huntley that one

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
ennis hundley and as Huntley that one
was<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.229> Recodo<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> picture

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
was actually the Recodo in that picture

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
was actually the Recodo in that picture
but<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.659> shows<00:01:42.689> us

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
but this one this actually shows us

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
but this one this actually shows us
first<00:01:43.649> look<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> huntley<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> believe

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
first look at the huntley I believe

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
maybe there's some leaked images that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.050 
maybe there's some leaked images that
people<00:01:46.799> found<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> code<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
people found in the code that kind of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
people found in the code that kind of
stuff<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.020> official<00:01:49.409> from

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the next picture is moving on to the gun

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.589 
the next picture is moving on to the gun
we<00:02:11.520> already<00:02:11.760> saw<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:11.970> before<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
we already saw this before this is the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.970 
we already saw this before this is the
bullpup<00:02:13.110> rifle

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
bullpup rifle

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.380 
bullpup rifle
and<00:02:14.099> pretty<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.760> looks<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> type

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and pretty much just looks like the type

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.780 
and pretty much just looks like the type
25<00:02:15.540> type<00:02:16.019> 95<00:02:16.349> which<00:02:17.220> ever<00:02:17.400> color<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
25 type 95 which ever color do you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.339 
25 type 95 which ever color do you
talking<00:02:18.209> about<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.750> pretty<00:02:19.049> much<00:02:19.200> just

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
talking about that it pretty much just

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.229 
talking about that it pretty much just
looks<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.159> an<00:02:20.340> extra<00:02:20.819> weapon<00:02:20.970> in

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
looks like that just an extra weapon in

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.089 
looks like that just an extra weapon in
the<00:02:21.330> game<00:02:21.510> whatever<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.530> too<00:02:22.680> big<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> deal

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the game whatever not too big of a deal

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.619 
the game whatever not too big of a deal
probably<00:02:23.370> won't<00:02:23.640> be<00:02:23.730> Opie<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.120> specs<00:02:24.510> or

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
probably won't be Opie on specs or

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.539 
probably won't be Opie on specs or
anything<00:02:24.989> crazy<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:25.409> that<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.400> another

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
anything crazy like that so just another

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.550 
anything crazy like that so just another
fun<00:02:26.819> weapon<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.360> finally<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.409> have<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
fun weapon and finally we have the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
fun weapon and finally we have the
picture<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.129> bike<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> Dinka

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
picture of the bike so this is the Dinka

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320 
picture of the bike so this is the Dinka
thrust<00:02:30.930> first<00:02:31.470> Dinka<00:02:31.890> bike<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.220> believe<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.819> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
thrust first Dinka bike I believe or I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.759 
thrust first Dinka bike I believe or I
can't<00:02:33.629> remember<00:02:33.810> i<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.170> there's<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.470> Dinka

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.330 
can't remember i think there's the Dinka
TT<00:02:35.160> actually<00:02:35.580> my<00:02:35.730> bad<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.290> bike<00:02:37.590> looks

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
TT actually my bad but this bike looks

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.770 
TT actually my bad but this bike looks
cool<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.790> me<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:39.030> only<00:02:39.150> really<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.660> see

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
cool to me you only really get to see

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.330 
cool to me you only really get to see
the<00:02:39.870> front<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.470> from<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.799> side<00:02:41.010> yet

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the front you can see from the side yet

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
the front you can see from the side yet
but<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.090> hoping<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.780> bike<00:02:43.230> is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
but I'm just hoping that this bike is

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.319 
but I'm just hoping that this bike is
actually<00:02:43.650> comparable<00:02:44.610> with<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> Beatty

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
actually comparable with like the Beatty

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.600 
actually comparable with like the Beatty
and<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.720> Akuma<00:02:46.170> that's<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:47.010> fast<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and the Akuma that's really fast and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.400 
and the Akuma that's really fast and
you'll<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:47.879> good<00:02:48.150> handling<00:02:48.900> all<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.110> kind

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you'll has good handling all that kind

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.990 
you'll has good handling all that kind
of<00:02:49.440> stuff<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> definitely<00:02:50.730> want<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
of stuff because I definitely want to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.220 
of stuff because I definitely want to
keep<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.329> my<00:02:51.420> garage<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.109> good

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
keep one in my garage and if it's good

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.589 
keep one in my garage and if it's good
enough<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:53.010> sure<00:02:53.040> will<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.359> all

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
enough I for sure will so that's all
