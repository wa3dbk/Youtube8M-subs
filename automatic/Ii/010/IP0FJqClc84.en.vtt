00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.820
 what 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.100
 what 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.930
 kikuchi or that we have found in situations of threats and dangers 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.009
 need 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.189
 It is precisely at these moments when a group of men and women arrive 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.710
 they go from the sixteenth century among the ladies the work that make proposals 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.380
 the heroic fire department 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.329
 was founded 51 years ago thanks to the initiative of the German anel jon huntsman 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.580
 in 1959 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.280
 in the mid-1950s peace in a small population and very 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 quiet 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.300
 in the year of 1957 a fire was registered in the facilities of the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.370
 tannery 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 It was then that Mr. Hamilton Smith and his son Eduardo saw the need to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.330
 create a fire department and rescues that help the population in case 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
 necessary 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.680
 I consider something personal 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.219
 I put on a person 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.880
 and I worry a lot about 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200
 people much care efe 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.180
 and a phone number 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 first that makes you feel lazy is to help people when 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 really needed 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780
 that's why 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.050
 from very child 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.350
 when I was in elementary school and omega pass the fire trucks 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.200
 I did not want to leave class to go and follow us when I had the opportunity 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.400
 I was leaving 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.080
 On several occasions he was treated by firefighter that time is striking me 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.970
 porthole 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.720
 they told me 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.830
 seven out of sight in the other fire that in stores 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.770
 p with the passage of time already to hamburg jun ap from a fire station 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 near my grandmother's house and today the goal rate 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.100
 every time there was some service the siren date I ran I did not run anymore 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 behind the trucks I ran to the fire station 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 perimeter admiring the station when they were going to work 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.619
 We were a group of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.439
 four firefighters 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.139
 to a rescue of a person who died in our mind they killed her and 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.659
 they threw a deposit we are talking about a shot of a mine to cover next to 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.509
 san antonio 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.579
 being there a hundred people who were going to enter the first was a 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.259
 summer police of the ministerial police judicial police does 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.469
 weather 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.879
 some miners 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.510
 and so they live among people who want to enter shortly after reaching the end of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.409
 accounts did not animate would not mind who not in the case of the miners 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.019
 they said read a little that it is very contaminated that was canceled today that you see - and 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.799
 what viper daddy daddy 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.900
 hundreds of crimes I talked to you with whatever I love you right now in this issue 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.669
 and the subject was so powerful that I get involved 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.299
 mc had more than a month since Friday saying that I get the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.059
 doctor is to prepare you 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.389
 you are going to get 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.859
 it is always necessary after the autonomous breathing team 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.129
 I entered the well 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.879
 what works with half an hour or so inside 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.819
 in this level 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.079
 the idea of â€‹â€‹including super photos the mask 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.749
 percent 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:19.449
 With all due respect do not move the body with the hands of the body especially 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.409
 I was already 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.319
 the state contribution factory already 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.480
 I had eleven minutes to do 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.789
 that is a worse thing 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.529
 but I practically had to be alone heaven 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.969
 when it started me they end up with him the air 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.749
 it was but an alarm the rug an alarm in the harness and 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.349
 start dreaming 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.889
 and the fellow firemen who are outside heard the alarm prevented the 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.049
 Pheasant case of people will end the former agent 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.709
 they started to take out 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.159
 but fortunately it gave me a little bit of time to finish me work that is 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.869
 doing with people 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.869
 and fortunately it was achieved 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.259
 we do not work we only say that we work in different types of rescue 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.569
 cn animals behind them of goal automotive rescue with personnel all 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.839
 and it's so pretty 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.379
 I will feel 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.029
 when you are supporting people 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.449
 it feels very monotonous we hope nothing changes nothing absolutely nothing 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.759
 g 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.849
 Being with the person makes the person many times in him 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.259
 there was a lot of respect like 3 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.830
 and how are we working to the rescue 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.439
 the automotive person because they are the majority of those because they are 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.099
 caught so pressed inside the vehicle 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.219
 sometimes they have to spend hours and hours the last rescue we pay 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.219
 it took us almost three hours to be able to get the person out 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.990
 but the moment we arrived with the staff 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.110
 there we stay we do not move we talk we are dealing with the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.059
 vrae the time passing a little 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.489
 I want to make it look less heavy the time saints well remain 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.029
 and we have to be us and dependent 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.719
 important message that you take care of yourself many times 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.740
 there's a lot 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.780
 Many photos are asking young people not only the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.089
 poor to all 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.960
 be very careful because you do not 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.280
 in the case of lorca to be very careful 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.889
 when driving 13 do not drive in serious condition and that is practically impossible 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 ask for it because 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.449
 if they do that they would be as careful as possible in the night, 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.449
 streets that do not trust sports are alone the streets have to run more 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.099
 is when more dangerous and mature with an accident because they have to be for 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.729
 the countries with the mind 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.610
 you need only one vehicle, nothing else 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.610
 and unfortunately when the 7th forts occur 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.470
 because they run more especially because center is confident 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.939
 and it is that the streets are lonely 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.999
 the traffic lights when it happens less green 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.999
 a conscious person goes well watched traffic light in green light 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.080
 ice-t do not 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.229
 small album 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.809

 it happens to we do not trust the most he forgave him with one less man to lose 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.319
 nor the most I love in my private car and jaime cibils mainly at night 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.539
 but at night and not a protest issue in green 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.089
 I take I'm afraid 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:15.300
 forte 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.770
 a river is passed when they take the step 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.770
 they want stability and employment if we happen to have 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.689
 the mission of the dedicated in fire department is thus to the population in 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.900
 emergency situation nissan juke 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.930
 In the same way, it is also contributing to be part of the culture of 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.930
 prevention 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.690
