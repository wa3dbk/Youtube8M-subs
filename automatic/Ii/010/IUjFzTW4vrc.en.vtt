00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 very good afternoon we are already 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.400
 here in a new videoblog broadcast 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.500
 how to create your perfect title and in this 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.000
 occasion we are going to see one of the techniques 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 most important of all the videoblog 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 let's be frank it may be that you 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 consider that it is easier to keep 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 all of your dog's food bowl 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.359
 that working with him may be that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 you believe that you do not have to be so 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.919
 specific when it comes to socializing 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.600
 what with people or even can be 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.579
 that you believe that your dog is going to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.980
 to be able to deal with all the stimuli that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 the environment has for him 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.510
 but this technique that we are going to see today is 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.610
 really important is more I 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.420
 I would say that if all the videoblog goes to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.059
 do a single technique that is this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 because because we're going to see inhibition of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.519
 the bite the inhibition of the bite 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 to begin with is something that when one like 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.589
 behavioral expert will review 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 a case of an aggressive dog 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 is the most important details that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.479
 they are checked if the dog has a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 good inhibition of the bite which is the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.100
 inhibition of the bite once 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.590
 finish the weaning when our dog 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 is still with your camera starts a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.869
 process where he begins to learn 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.909
 to control the pressure that exerts with 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.520
 the jaws and with the teeth 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.460
 this process believe me gentlemen them 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.659
 It is very interesting to generalize what 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.819
 you and other dogs remember 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.700
 that in the last videoblog we had the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.719
 hand full of food after preparing 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.719
 the beer 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.250
 Well, this is what we are going to 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.320
 use right now to start doing 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.719
 inhibition of mobility with us 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.909
 and that we will work on if we give it 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.100
 to our dog to lick our hand 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.470
 full of food but if in some 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 when we played with him a tooth 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.660
 we will say a dry no or we will complain as 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 If he had hurt us by removing 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.620
 immediate hand 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.330
 once he has sat down and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.700
 reassured we will return your hand 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.159
 so that it continues but if it incurs 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.140
 three faults we will remove completely 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.299
 the right to lick us and you can not 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.379
 do it until we go back to work 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.379
 This exercise 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.510
 now it is also important to mention 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.770
 that if they are playing with him they are 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.720
 doing any other kind of 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.450
 interaction that is nice for your 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.660
 dog with you and super touches them with 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.450
 a tooth, even if it is important that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 also scold him or complain 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 mark well that should not be the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.849
 touching with your teeth 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.700
 now as for the dogs what 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.069
 let's do it, it's really very 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.260
 little because the processes rather the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.480
 they have to carry between them we have 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.030
 that allow you to play our dog with 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.670
 other dogs but watching the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.010
 interaction to be able to take it from 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.000
 effective way and that we 're going to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.000
 work like this 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.939
 the next action can be strong 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.569
 for some but really only 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.760
 it's a game this type of interactions 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.490
 they can be common and in fact now 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.340
 they will be beneficial 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.320
 The only thing that needs to be checked is that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.290
 our dog never incurs a 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.200
 direct aggression this we will notice already 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.730
 that the other dog will try to get away 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.400
 while our dog continues with 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.530
 the fixed bite in the same place as 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.510
 otherwise we should let them be 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.510
 those who relive their differences 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.169
 ah 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.940
 ah 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.940
 do not 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.820
 Y 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.420
 I dont know 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.449

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.680
