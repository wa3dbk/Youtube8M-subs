don't fold the other side just fold one
side<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.700> fold<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.329> we

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
side in then fold this up so that we

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.330 
side in then fold this up so that we
have<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
have this this is gonna be like the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.600 
have this this is gonna be like the
pleat<00:01:34.310> now

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.920 

yeah<00:01:42.350> fold<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> down<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:44.370> an<00:01:45.240> angle<00:01:45.330> don't

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
yeah fold this down at an angle don't

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.920 
yeah fold this down at an angle don't
fold<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> straight<00:01:47.070> folding<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.790> an<00:01:47.850> angle<00:01:49.670> and

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
fold it straight folding at an angle and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.550 
fold it straight folding at an angle and
then<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.230> same<00:01:52.410> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> other<00:01:52.890> side

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
then do the same with the other side

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.670 
then do the same with the other side
like<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:57.290> fold<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.440> whole<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:58.950> down

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
like this and fold this whole thing down

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
like this and fold this whole thing down
like<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:04.640> unfold<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.480> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
like this unfold it and we have that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.650 
like this unfold it and we have that
crease<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.950> crease<00:02:08.330> there<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:09.540> be

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
crease on that crease there should be

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.450 
crease on that crease there should be
this<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:09.960> bit<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.590> we're<00:02:11.040> gonna<00:02:11.160> take

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
this little bit here we're gonna take

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.810 
this little bit here we're gonna take
that<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.240> pull<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.960> and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that and we're gonna pull it out and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.150 
that and we're gonna pull it out and
then<00:02:14.820> we're<00:02:14.940> gonna<00:02:15.060> squash<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.570> down<00:02:16.160> like

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
then we're gonna squash it down like

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
then we're gonna squash it down like
this<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.690> inside<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.260> kind

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
this so then if we look inside it kind

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.870 
this so then if we look inside it kind
of<00:02:19.709> looks<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.040> this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.220 

now<00:02:23.880> they'll<00:02:24.060> give<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:24.990> be<00:02:25.140> his

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
now they'll give this it's gonna be his

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.790 
now they'll give this it's gonna be his
face

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
face

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.660 
face
so<00:02:26.580> okay<00:02:27.330> now<00:02:27.630> what<00:02:28.260> you're<00:02:28.350> gonna<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.400> fold

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so okay now what you're gonna do is fold

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.010 
so okay now what you're gonna do is fold
out<00:02:29.850> an<00:02:29.970> angle<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.480> make<00:02:30.600> sure<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
out an angle and make sure that this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.790 
out an angle and make sure that this
whole<00:02:31.260> triangle<00:02:32.060> gets<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.800> you'll

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
whole triangle gets back there you'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.440 
whole triangle gets back there you'll
see<00:02:34.980> why<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.190> whole<00:02:35.490> triangle<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> when<00:02:42.360> we

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
see why the whole triangle and when we

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.650 
see why the whole triangle and when we
flip<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.780> over<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.200> have<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:44.360> know<00:02:45.360> what

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
flip it over we have this know what

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.290 
flip it over we have this know what
we're<00:02:45.840> gonna<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:47.489> we're<00:02:47.790> gonna<00:02:47.850> take<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.390 
we're gonna do is we're gonna take this
triangle<00:02:48.750> right<00:02:49.019> here<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.800> we're<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:50.040> pull

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
triangle right here and we're gonna pull

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.900 
triangle right here and we're gonna pull
it<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.330> we're<00:02:51.480> gonna<00:02:51.600> squash<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.380> out

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it out and we're gonna squash it out

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
it out and we're gonna squash it out
stop<00:02:53.910> squash<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.690> down<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.140> out<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.560> we'll

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
stop squash it down and out so we'll

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.479 
stop squash it down and out so we'll
flip<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.489> over<00:02:56.610> looks<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:58.250> divider<00:02:59.250> is

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
flip it over looks like this divider is

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.100 
flip it over looks like this divider is
a<00:02:59.519> little<00:02:59.790> wrinkly<00:03:00.060> every<00:03:00.390> time<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.600> fold<00:03:01.019> in

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
a little wrinkly every time I fold in

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.720 
a little wrinkly every time I fold in
one<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.320> these<00:03:01.440> guys<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:01.950> came<00:03:02.160> out<00:03:02.220> wrinkly

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
one of these guys they came out wrinkly

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
one of these guys they came out wrinkly
a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:04.050> around<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.680> part<00:03:04.890> where<00:03:05.010> we

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
a little bit around that part where we

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.840 
a little bit around that part where we
just<00:03:05.310> squashed<00:03:05.610> out<00:03:06.260> great<00:03:07.260> there<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.700> can

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
just squashed out great there you can

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.090 
just squashed out great there you can
see<00:03:09.140> now<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.290> we're<00:03:10.410> gonna<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.890> we're

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
see now what we're gonna do is we're

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.400 
see now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:03:11.220> push<00:03:12.120> we're<00:03:12.540> gonna<00:03:12.690> open<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
gonna push we're gonna open up this

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
gonna push we're gonna open up this
without<00:03:13.769> ripping<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.370> don't<00:03:14.610> rip<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
without ripping it don't rip it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.229 
without ripping it don't rip it
and<00:03:15.410> then<00:03:16.410> fold<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:19.080> crease<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.680> good

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
and then fold this in and crease it good

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.690 
and then fold this in and crease it good
because<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.570> don't<00:03:21.600> want<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.440> undone

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.970 

so<00:03:28.300> then<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.840> something<00:03:29.349> looks<00:03:29.650> kinda

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
so then we have something looks kinda

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.150 
so then we have something looks kinda
like<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.310> okay<00:03:31.620> there's<00:03:32.620> only<00:03:32.680> two<00:03:32.980> more

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
like this okay there's only two more

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.229 
like this okay there's only two more
folds<00:03:33.580> left<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.310> you're<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:36.760> gonna<00:03:36.910> take

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
folds left and you're just gonna take

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.460 
folds left and you're just gonna take
these<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.510> you're<00:03:37.840> gonna<00:03:37.930> make<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.260> feet<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
these and you're gonna make the feet a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.320 
these and you're gonna make the feet a
little<00:03:38.680> bit<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.120> close<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.050> wide

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
little bit not as close and not as wide

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.530 
little bit not as close and not as wide
actually<00:03:43.330> there<00:03:43.750> actually<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.440> another<00:03:44.709> fold

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
actually there actually is another fold

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.030 
actually there actually is another fold
I'm<00:03:46.540> gonna<00:03:46.780> take<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.140> point<00:03:47.650> how<00:03:47.830> we<00:03:47.890> have

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
I'm gonna take this point how we have

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.090 
I'm gonna take this point how we have
this<00:03:48.160> point<00:03:48.459> here<00:03:48.610> let<00:03:48.940> me<00:03:48.970> did<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.750> end<00:03:50.100> when

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
this point here let me did it end when

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.640 
this point here let me did it end when
we<00:03:51.330> fold<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.510> at<00:03:52.630> an<00:03:52.720> angle<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.260> fold

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
we fold it in at an angle and just fold

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.080 
we fold it in at an angle and just fold
it<00:03:53.800> back<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.830> then<00:03:56.950> squash<00:03:57.430> anything<00:03:57.910> down

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
it back and then squash anything down

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.460 
it back and then squash anything down
that<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.420> need<00:04:00.330> hold<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.450> as<00:04:01.540> straight<00:04:02.140> as<00:04:02.350> you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
that you need hold it as straight as you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.640 
that you need hold it as straight as you
can<00:04:02.650> possibly<00:04:02.800> get<00:04:06.480> when<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.540> said<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.500> there

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
can possibly get when I said that there

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.960 
can possibly get when I said that there
were<00:04:08.739> two<00:04:08.890> more<00:04:09.010> folds<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.370> was<00:04:09.459> actually<00:04:09.700> four

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
were two more folds it was actually four

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.960 
were two more folds it was actually four
more<00:04:10.180> folds<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:10.920> maybe<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.010> little<00:04:12.130> bit<00:04:12.430> more<00:04:12.640> if

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
more folds or maybe a little bit more if

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.800 
more folds or maybe a little bit more if
you<00:04:13.030> want<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.600> adjust<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.350> even<00:04:14.560> make<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.160> even

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you want to adjust it even make it even

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.120 
you want to adjust it even make it even
okay<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.260> left<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.769> up<00:04:17.859> again

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
okay I just left that one up again

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.830 
okay I just left that one up again
there's<00:04:18.669> not<00:04:18.850> four<00:04:19.060> more<00:04:19.239> folds<00:04:19.600> there's<00:04:19.750> one

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
there's not four more folds there's one

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.590 
there's not four more folds there's one
more<00:04:19.989> fold<00:04:20.229> or<00:04:20.620> two<00:04:20.829> more<00:04:20.979> phones<00:04:21.250> okay<00:04:21.790> I'm<00:04:21.970> so

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
more fold or two more phones okay I'm so

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.159 
more fold or two more phones okay I'm so
one<00:04:22.750> things<00:04:22.990> up<00:04:23.139> just<00:04:23.830> found<00:04:24.580> off<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:25.060> if<00:04:25.960> it
