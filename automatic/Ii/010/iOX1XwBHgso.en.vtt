Ashley Young in his pocket today Ashley

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
Ashley Young in his pocket today Ashley
Young<00:00:30.510> apart<00:00:30.869> from<00:00:30.990> setting<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> goal<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
Young apart from setting up the goal and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.740 
Young apart from setting up the goal and
most<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> his<00:00:32.850> crosses<00:00:33.059> didn't<00:00:33.480> beat<00:00:33.600> his

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
most of his crosses didn't beat his

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
most of his crosses didn't beat his
first<00:00:33.960> man<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.620> Kyle<00:00:34.860> Walker<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
first man it was Kyle Walker and but I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.670 
first man it was Kyle Walker and but I
think<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.329> been<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.570> case<00:00:36.809> we've<00:00:37.110> we've

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
think that's been the case we've we've

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
think that's been the case we've we've
actually<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> very<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.730> long<00:00:38.969> time<00:00:39.120> he

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually on for a very very long time he

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
actually on for a very very long time he
can't<00:00:40.350> cross<00:00:40.590> his<00:00:40.770> legs<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.340> love<00:00:41.520> him

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
can't cross his legs and I love him

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
can't cross his legs and I love him
because<00:00:42.120> he<00:00:42.300> works<00:00:42.510> how<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> deserved<00:00:43.410> his

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
because he works how you deserved his

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
because he works how you deserved his
spot<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> team<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.789> think

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
spot in the team and all that I think

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
spot in the team and all that I think
that<00:00:45.450> good<00:00:45.690> enough<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that good enough I don't think I kind of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
that good enough I don't think I kind of
think<00:00:47.000> defenders<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.570> sit<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.840> his

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
think defenders know to just sit on his

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
think defenders know to just sit on his
right<00:00:49.140> foot<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.590> he's<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.829> desperate<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.460> a
