00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it went very well but toward the end I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
it went very well but toward the end I
felt<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.150> got<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> groove

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
plans that can really be scalable and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.529 
plans that can really be scalable and

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
turn into something amazing so it's good

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.940 
turn into something amazing so it's good
to<00:01:49.659> be<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.780> part<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.200> watching<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.740> come
