for a little bit you popped your W right
before<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> hit<00:02:20.770> your<00:02:20.920> e<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.730> should<00:02:21.910> be

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
before you hit your e so that should be

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.120 
before you hit your e so that should be
going<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.240> very<00:02:22.300> soon<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.200> hit<00:02:23.410> your<00:02:23.650> auto

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.120 
attack and you push q immediately and it
will<00:02:25.990> auto<00:02:26.110> attack<00:02:26.410> again<00:02:26.680> when<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.890> stuns

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
will auto attack again when it stuns

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.160 
will auto attack again when it stuns
them<00:02:27.310> boom<00:02:27.880> your<00:02:28.120> W<00:02:28.360> goes<00:02:28.540> off<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.020> just

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
them boom your W goes off and then just

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
them boom your W goes off and then just
walk<00:02:29.530> away<00:02:29.590> unless<00:02:30.100> your<00:02:30.700> Carey<00:02:31.090> decides<00:02:31.240> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
walk away unless your Carey decides to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.700 
walk away unless your Carey decides to
continue<00:02:31.720> pushing<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.410> there's<00:02:32.530> an

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
continue pushing and there's an

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.530 
continue pushing and there's an
advantage<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.000> main<00:02:34.120> thing<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.330> want<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
advantage but the main thing you want to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
advantage but the main thing you want to
do<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.860> combo<00:02:36.190> hit

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
do is just do that one little combo hit

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.890 
do is just do that one little combo hit
them<00:02:36.520> once<00:02:36.850> or<00:02:36.940> twice<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:37.570> walk<00:02:37.720> away

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
them once or twice and then walk away

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380 
them once or twice and then walk away
that<00:02:38.560> way<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.040> allows<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.790> grasp<00:02:40.180> them

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that way it allows you to grasp them

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.850 
that way it allows you to grasp them
down<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> really<00:02:41.230> don't<00:02:41.350> take<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> lot<00:02:41.800> of

down and you really don't take a lot of
damage<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.490> return<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
damage in return to it because of the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.420 
damage in return to it because of the
fact<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.500> they're<00:02:44.770> locked<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.160> there

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
fact that they're locked down there

this gives me a really good mix of
survivability<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.610> then<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.030> move<00:05:14.180> speed<00:05:14.390> is

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
survivability and then the move speed is

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.720 
survivability and then the move speed is
very<00:05:14.630> important<00:05:14.930> on<00:05:14.960> her<00:05:15.110> even<00:05:15.830> in<00:05:16.370> case<00:05:16.580> you

behind and clean up and most likely
you'll<00:06:20.930> still<00:06:21.260> be<00:06:21.380> alive<00:06:21.590> because<00:06:22.250> you<00:06:22.460> pop

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
you'll still be alive because you pop

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.980 
you'll still be alive because you pop
down<00:06:22.850> your<00:06:23.000> ultimate<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.420> you<00:06:23.480> stun<00:06:23.690> them<00:06:23.840> and

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
down your ultimate and you stun them and

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.530 
down your ultimate and you stun them and
you<00:06:24.050> can<00:06:24.170> walk<00:06:24.350> away<00:06:24.380> and<00:06:24.860> they'll<00:06:25.850> shift

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
you can walk away and they'll shift

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.030 
you can walk away and they'll shift
focus<00:06:26.690> off<00:06:26.960> of<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.140> and<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.350> can<00:06:27.470> run<00:06:27.650> back<00:06:27.800> in

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
focus off of you and you can run back in

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.180 
focus off of you and you can run back in
and<00:06:28.280> start<00:06:29.240> doing<00:06:29.510> some<00:06:30.020> more<00:06:30.170> CC<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:30.890> more

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
and start doing some more CC and more

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.130 
and start doing some more CC and more
focus<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.700> eventually<00:06:32.660> that's<00:06:32.810> just<00:06:33.050> going

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
focus and eventually that's just going

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.930 
focus and eventually that's just going
to<00:06:33.230> wear<00:06:33.380> them<00:06:33.530> down<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:33.980> that's<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.790> way<00:06:34.880> you

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
to wear them down and that's the way you

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.150 
to wear them down and that's the way you
want<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.150> play<00:06:35.210> leona<00:06:35.690> like<00:06:36.410> up<00:06:36.680> in<00:06:36.830> your<00:06:36.980> face

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
want to play leona like up in your face

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.920 
want to play leona like up in your face
and<00:06:37.400> upset<00:06:37.760> it<00:06:37.850> like<00:06:37.940> three<00:06:38.060> times<00:06:38.150> now<00:06:38.510> but<00:06:38.750> i

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
and upset it like three times now but i

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.300 
and upset it like three times now but i
think<00:06:39.110> you<00:06:39.200> should<00:06:39.230> get<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.560> idea

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
think you should get the idea

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.730 
think you should get the idea
so<00:06:40.880> my<00:06:41.060> final<00:06:41.180> thoughts<00:06:41.450> Leona<00:06:41.960> is<00:06:42.230> she<00:06:42.500> good

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
so my final thoughts Leona is she good

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.320 
so my final thoughts Leona is she good
is<00:06:42.860> she<00:06:42.890> worth<00:06:43.100> buying<00:06:43.340> I<00:06:43.610> think<00:06:44.000> that<00:06:44.150> she<00:06:44.300> is

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
is she worth buying I think that she is

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.970 
is she worth buying I think that she is
definitely<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:44.990> lot<00:06:45.140> of<00:06:45.260> fun<00:06:45.410> to<00:06:45.560> play<00:06:45.770> if

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
definitely a lot of fun to play if

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.250 
definitely a lot of fun to play if
you're<00:06:46.460> interested<00:06:47.030> in<00:06:47.150> a<00:06:47.330> good<00:06:47.780> duo<00:06:48.050> Lane

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
you're interested in a good duo Lane

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.530 
you're interested in a good duo Lane
champion<00:06:48.740> that<00:06:49.190> can<00:06:49.490> be<00:06:49.640> a<00:06:49.670> great<00:06:50.000> tank<00:06:50.330> and<00:06:50.510> a

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
champion that can be a great tank and a

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.810 
champion that can be a great tank and a
great<00:06:50.690> initiator<00:06:51.110> but<00:06:51.650> can't<00:06:52.430> do<00:06:52.550> a<00:06:52.580> whole<00:06:52.760> lot

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
great initiator but can't do a whole lot

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.310 
great initiator but can't do a whole lot
of<00:06:53.030> damage<00:06:53.180> then<00:06:53.510> she<00:06:53.630> might<00:06:53.720> be<00:06:53.900> good<00:06:53.990> for<00:06:54.050> you

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
of damage then she might be good for you

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.490 
of damage then she might be good for you
and<00:06:54.500> I<00:06:55.490> think<00:06:55.850> that<00:06:56.090> she's<00:06:56.360> most<00:06:57.290> definitely

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
and I think that she's most definitely

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.340 
and I think that she's most definitely
not<00:06:57.980> Opie<00:06:58.670> but<00:06:59.150> she<00:06:59.270> is<00:06:59.390> very<00:06:59.420> balanced<00:07:00.110> she's

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
not Opie but she is very balanced she's

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.960 
not Opie but she is very balanced she's
not<00:07:00.500> under<00:07:00.800> powered<00:07:01.100> she<00:07:01.460> brings<00:07:01.670> a<00:07:01.790> lot<00:07:01.910> to

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
not under powered she brings a lot to

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.530 
not under powered she brings a lot to
the<00:07:02.120> team<00:07:02.360> so<00:07:02.990> a<00:07:03.530> solid<00:07:04.250> pick<00:07:04.460> overall<00:07:04.790> and<00:07:05.180> I

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
the team so a solid pick overall and I

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.730
