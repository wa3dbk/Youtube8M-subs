00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.610

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.610
 that they did not tell him that I was there 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.230

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.100
 important that he shared with sophia 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.220

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.399
 considered the best advice she 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.890
 I had seen two years ago in a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.800
 particular moment of my life we ​​were 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.700

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.550
 he came to see us and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.379
 he said sofía look I'm very sad 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.379
