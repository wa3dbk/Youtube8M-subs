and there you got so there's a really
neat<00:01:07.770> features<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.729> well<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.260> go

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
neat features to this as well when we go

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100 
neat features to this as well when we go
inside<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.220> you'll<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.270> inside

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
inside here you'll know that inside

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
inside here you'll know that inside
there's<00:01:13.619> almost<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> French<00:01:14.340> drain<00:01:14.850> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
there's almost like a French drain in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.260 
there's almost like a French drain in
that<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.810> while<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.979> dog<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.610> cat<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> inside

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that if while your dog or cat is inside

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.020 
that if while your dog or cat is inside
if<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.659> an<00:01:18.810> accident<00:01:19.729> basically<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
if they have an accident basically it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
if they have an accident basically it
will<00:01:21.240> drain<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> sides<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.740> stay

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
will drain into the sides and not stay

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
will drain into the sides and not stay
on<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.210> think<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> great

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on them so I think that's a great

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
on them so I think that's a great
integrative<00:01:25.500> feature<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.400> on

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
integrative feature that they have on

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.440 
integrative feature that they have on
this<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.380> open<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> top<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
this you can open this from the top so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.640 
this you can open this from the top so
you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> unclip<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.140> access

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you can unclip these and you can access

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
you can unclip these and you can access
and<00:01:34.890> fully<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.090> need<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.420> do
