00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.000
 and very good friends here I bring you a 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.550
 Minecraft video to show you a 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.090
 map called mines tirith sure what 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.570
 you know already you have said the lord of the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.570
 rings' and well I see it less happy 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.970
 but do not look what piece of hand we're going to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 go giving some chicken or I'll put as 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.600
 a little kinematics that I'm going to do 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.420
 with a little music and nothing 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.780
 good so you see here set the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 size of the tower 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.030
 is created very well received 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.239
 technically imagine 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.420
 we can put anything back here until the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.930
 infinite not up here but let's 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930
 go up 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.280
 so I said that I have not seen what 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.400
 best lord of the rings' return of the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 King will surely know mine mines 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.130
 tirith I am not mistaken in the region of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130
 Condor 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.160
 because we see it as the big 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.979
 and we're going to get you up on the top 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.979
 the part of the tree 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 here it is 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.890
 the known tree 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.790
 here we have 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.950
 these boats 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 and we will not go up to the ok 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.500
 well here I found 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.450
 what 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 the good selection 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.290
 and it's very good the map is very big 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.240
 and happy because others 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.799
 I like many but these rings 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.020
 and that minecraft a map for minecraft 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.040
 of Tirith mines we are looking for them 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.050
 This is the throne but I'll fix it 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.280
 a little bit has a small flaw that a 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 fake 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.030
 what is we going to put this here 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.020
 and next to it has the illusion 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.780
 it's called good yes 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.780
 and this would be the magician 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.409
 behind 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.780
 today to be blown away that I have not seen 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.080
 but after the movie I guess it will be 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.450
 all 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.450
 it's good to throw the torch and 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.090
 good 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.270
 they are mines so that's like a 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.470
 blanket is like it's not a mountain and have 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.390
 gone building by beige and good tyc 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.030
 this is the cake that they light good in 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.910
 part the attention fire saying in 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.910
 the entire region for a notice 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.310
 and this would be all if I'm not wrong 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.310
 the tree 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.370
 I think I say goodbye here and I leave you 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.849
 with the cinematics that I told you 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.510
 look how big it is to build everything 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.510
 this already rubber 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.290
 the mountaineer you see 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.770
 what tramontana with house and the background that 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.770
 the strong 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.650
 It is very well done I loved it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.650
 much 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.660
 what is inside 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.040
 do not give there they will fill what you feel 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.040
 with what's inside of this 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.799
 well I ask you here I leave you with that 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 little kinematics that I've done and goodbye
