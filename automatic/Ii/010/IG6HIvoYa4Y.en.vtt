00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 yes 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:09.470
 josé pistón lopez is after painting 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 the crown a fiery career and now 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.710
 face a great Mexican champion of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.650
 all the time an expense was delayed you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.860
 how do you feel for this challenge 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.080
 the truth that I feel very very 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.940
 excited for fighting with a necklace 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.810
 as per the category that is a 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.519
 ghost rope 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 and this is why we have not made the 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.779
 otherwise nothing more 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.910
 it's a game all world title of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.910
 crown everything 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.620
 the world 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.820
 I do not complete the best ones with same with 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.250
 the people that are up 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.630
 so that what I bring to die 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.630
 I can do mine the ring 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 how have you prepared for this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.409
 contest 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.409
 and I was asking that this preparation 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.220
 I feel better 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.360
 strategies I feel able to win 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.310
 not this holds still cross of the world 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.480
 as exact series of the and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.330
 revolutions 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.210
 as not, well, that's what we're going to see 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 Saturday back 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.660
 but my coach all my team is 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.800
 very intensely what are we going to do the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.800
 Saturday against a bolt 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.950
 nothing happens to be champion and not 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.710
 I do not care who we know this is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.680
 what feels more explosive or more 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.190
 most inclusive technical is I think it is 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 very strong I did not carry forward it 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.630
 want when you appreciate when it comes to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 of looking for the excited one when you try 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.360
 to go down I was lowered was a fighter 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.770
 that the truth is many things and that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120
 it's based on the experience I have 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.819
 I have many fights 25 fights but 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.830
 all compilers strong as your record 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.769
 in these 25 cops and 3 fights won 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.379
 and two lost 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.470
 with everything else in this fight and if this one 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.680
 is fighting half of my life and I have been 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.599
 given an opportunity the company and when 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.120
 I'm going to waste it is not what I 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.329
 I liked to do a lot and this is 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.040
 opportunity is winning and opens 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.140
 a new panorama in your career continues 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.930
 winning the humberto we know we have 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.350
 what to prove in many doors 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.580
 and we know what 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.820
 of what we can do then 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.830
 to give him hard on Saturday and also many 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.830
