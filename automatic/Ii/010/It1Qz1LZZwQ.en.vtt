I<00:00:11.080> have<00:00:12.080> two<00:00:12.290> tulips<00:00:12.710> here<00:00:12.950> they're<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.730> same

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
I have two tulips here they're the same

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.030 
I have two tulips here they're the same
size<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.600> they're<00:00:15.110> kissing<00:00:15.530> up<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:15.709> each

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
size and they're kissing up to each

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.310 
size and they're kissing up to each
other<00:00:16.250> this<00:00:16.850> would<00:00:17.060> be<00:00:17.180> much<00:00:17.450> better<00:00:17.480> designed

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
other this would be much better designed

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.190 
other this would be much better designed
piece<00:00:18.740> if<00:00:19.040> one<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.150> tulips<00:00:20.509> was<00:00:20.689> larger

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
piece if one of the tulips was larger

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400 
piece if one of the tulips was larger
and<00:00:21.349> overlapped<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.490> other<00:00:22.930> let's<00:00:23.930> take<00:00:24.230> this

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
and overlapped the other let's take this

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.760 
and overlapped the other let's take this
yellow<00:00:24.680> tulip<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:25.460> make<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.119> bigger<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:26.779> make

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
yellow tulip and make it bigger and make

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.830 
yellow tulip and make it bigger and make
it<00:00:27.980> overlap<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.880> other<00:00:28.910> tulip

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
it overlap the other tulip

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.290 
it overlap the other tulip
this<00:00:30.109> would<00:00:30.350> make<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.590> mama<00:00:31.010> bear<00:00:31.340> sized<00:00:31.760> tulip

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
this would make a mama bear sized tulip

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.280 
this would make a mama bear sized tulip
and<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.840> baby<00:00:33.290> bear<00:00:33.620> size<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.390> I'm<00:00:35.809> going

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
and a baby bear size to it so I'm going

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.600 
and a baby bear size to it so I'm going
to<00:00:36.410> cover<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.980> area<00:00:37.699> with<00:00:37.940> tape<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.309> lift<00:00:40.309> up

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
that red and then we'll be able to paint

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:59.490

side of the tool always blocked very

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.430 
side of the tool always blocked very

area as a highlight in the middle of the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.069 
area as a highlight in the middle of the
tool<00:02:35.519> now<00:02:36.519> you'll<00:02:36.730> notice<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.540> stem<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.049> a

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
tool now you'll notice this stem is a

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.059 
tool now you'll notice this stem is a
little<00:02:38.439> bit<00:02:38.680> skinny<00:02:39.129> for<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.269> tulip<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:41.069> I'm

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
little bit skinny for the tulip and I'm

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.190 
little bit skinny for the tulip and I'm
going<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.430> fatten<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.359> up<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.629> little<00:02:43.780> bit<00:02:44.019> more

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
going to fatten it up a little bit more

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.649 
going to fatten it up a little bit more
because<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.680> have<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.859> bigger<00:02:45.159> bigger<00:02:46.030> bud<00:02:46.389> that

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
because we have a bigger bigger bud that

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:59.950 
because we have a bigger bigger bud that
it<00:02:46.780> has<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.139> support

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.140 

see<00:03:00.960> how<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:01.920> we<00:03:01.980> don't<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.370> two<00:03:02.730> tulips

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
see how now we don't have two tulips

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.690 
see how now we don't have two tulips
kissing<00:03:03.750> up<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.900> each<00:03:04.230> other<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.400> one

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
kissing up to each other we have one

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.030 
kissing up to each other we have one
large<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.270> dominating<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.260> another<00:03:07.740> one
