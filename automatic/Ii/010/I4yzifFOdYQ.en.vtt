00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
link one of the teleporters so I can't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.560 
link one of the teleporters so I can't
pack<00:00:30.750> punch<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.399> pointless<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:32.969> um<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.390> just

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
pack punch it is pointless but um I just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
pack punch it is pointless but um I just
wanted<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.489> near

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
wanted to show that as well as my near

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020 
wanted to show that as well as my near
death<00:00:36.559> situation<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
death situation right there you have the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
death situation right there you have the
strategy<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:40.110> gonna<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.379> into<00:00:40.530> now

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
strategy that we're gonna get into now

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.190 
strategy that we're gonna get into now
so<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> start<00:00:41.969> every<00:00:42.090> round<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> first<00:00:42.899> room

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so I start every round in the first room

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
so I start every round in the first room
here<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.640> steam<00:00:44.910> overlay<00:00:45.180> ignore

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
here and I would steam overlay ignore

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
here and I would steam overlay ignore
that<00:00:45.840> also<00:00:46.590> over<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> have

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that also over there you can see I have

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
that also over there you can see I have
this<00:00:47.820> bond<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.360> closed<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.800> side

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this bond or closed on the other side

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.160 
this bond or closed on the other side
which<00:00:50.399> makes<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.940> zombies<00:00:51.870> only

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
which makes it so that zombies only

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
which makes it so that zombies only
spawn<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> six<00:00:52.920> windows<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> faster

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
spawn in six windows which is faster

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
spawn in six windows which is faster
than<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> eight<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
than I think that eight that it would be

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
than I think that eight that it would be
if<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> door<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.629> open<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:58.980> now

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
if that door was open also right now

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400 
if that door was open also right now
zombies<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.850> sponded<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> hit<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
zombies are all sponded so I hit the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
zombies are all sponded so I hit the
trap<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.570> they're<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.600> dead<00:01:03.750> pretty

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
trap and now they're all dead pretty

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
trap and now they're all dead pretty
much<00:01:04.260> yeah<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.309> fast<00:01:05.519> I'd<00:01:05.729> say<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.479> on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
much yeah pretty fast I'd say so on

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
much yeah pretty fast I'd say so on
whatever<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.140> come<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.680> I'll<00:01:07.830> repair<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
whatever I come up here I'll repair that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
whatever I come up here I'll repair that
double<00:01:08.790> tap<00:01:08.970> window<00:01:09.299> about<00:01:09.510> four<00:01:10.020> times

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
double tap window about four times

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
double tap window about four times
result<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:11.369> been<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> couple

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
result that where there's been a couple

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
result that where there's been a couple
times<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.930> um<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.310> part<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> pretty

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
times then um for this part I pretty

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
times then um for this part I pretty
much<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> strategy<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.869> CJ<00:01:16.380> gear<00:01:16.619> off

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
much to do the strategy that CJ gear off

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
much to do the strategy that CJ gear off
the<00:01:17.070> current<00:01:17.490> world<00:01:17.640> record<00:01:17.850> holder<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the current world record holder on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
the current world record holder on
darice<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.799> bridge<00:01:20.189> game<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.810> what<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
darice did bridge game and what that is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
darice did bridge game and what that is
is<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.439> much<00:01:22.560> dropping<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.729> once

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
is pretty much dropping down here once

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
is pretty much dropping down here once
the<00:01:24.210> zombies<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.200> running<00:01:26.159> over

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the zombies come and then running over

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
the zombies come and then running over
to<00:01:26.490> STG<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:28.130> coming<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.610> Thompson

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to STG and then coming back to Thompson

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
to STG and then coming back to Thompson
except<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> way

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
except I will not be going all the way

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
except I will not be going all the way
to<00:01:31.740> Thompson<00:01:32.220> instead<00:01:32.700> i'll<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.450> doing<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to Thompson instead i'll be doing up the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
to Thompson instead i'll be doing up the
only<00:01:34.409> thing<00:01:34.619> pretty<00:01:34.799> much<00:01:34.860> different<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.670> my

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
only thing pretty much different with my

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.969 
only thing pretty much different with my
strategy<00:01:36.450> compared<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> CJ's<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:37.829> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
strategy compared to CJ's which is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.660 
strategy compared to CJ's which is
hitting<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> trap<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> bridge<00:01:40.590> area<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
hitting that trap on the bridge area you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
hitting that trap on the bridge area you
can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.329> yeah<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.070> I'll<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
can see right there yeah and I'll be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.770 
can see right there yeah and I'll be
hitting<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.700> every<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.750> over

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
hitting that every time i go over

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
hitting that every time i go over
towards<00:01:46.259> Thompson<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
towards Thompson which will make it so

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
towards Thompson which will make it so
that<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> Caleb<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.210> Ward's<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> time

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that it Caleb out to Ward's in the time

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830 
that it Caleb out to Ward's in the time
that<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.770> takes<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> kill<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.210> thermal

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that it takes to kill one with thermal

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.100 
that it takes to kill one with thermal
strategy<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.240> very<00:01:54.240> fast<00:01:54.720> I'd<00:01:54.930> say

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
strategy which is very fast I'd say

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.469 
strategy which is very fast I'd say
compared<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> UM<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.250> only<00:01:56.460> save<00:01:56.880> strategy<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
compared to UM the only save strategy on

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.289 
compared to UM the only save strategy on
this<00:01:57.600> map<00:01:57.750> before<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.180> get

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
this map before which is that so you get

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
this map before which is that so you get
to<00:02:00.390> see<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:01.320> hitting<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> shop

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
to see right here I'm hitting the shop

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
to see right here I'm hitting the shop
and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.479> running<00:02:03.899> all<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.350> way<00:02:04.380> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and then I'm running all the way to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.610 
and then I'm running all the way to
spawn<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:05.040> now

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
spawn right now

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.010 
spawn right now
because<00:02:05.890> I'm<00:02:06.160> women<00:02:06.670> spot<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:07.420> control<00:02:07.870> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
because I'm women spot I can control the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.710 
because I'm women spot I can control the
spawns<00:02:08.260> of<00:02:08.530> zombies<00:02:08.979> spawns<00:02:09.790> spawn<00:02:10.479> spawn

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
spawns of zombies spawns spawn spawn

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.470 
spawns of zombies spawns spawn spawn
spawn<00:02:10.960> lots<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.440> fun<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.670> contrary<00:02:13.210> yeah

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
spawn lots of fun and it's contrary yeah

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
spawn lots of fun and it's contrary yeah
and<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:15.160> pretty<00:02:15.280> much<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
and then it's pretty much like the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.070 
and then it's pretty much like the
beginning<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> round<00:02:16.660> they're<00:02:16.990> all

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
beginning of the round they're all

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.780 
beginning of the round they're all
spawning<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.560> again<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.340> will<00:02:18.670> hit

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
spawning it again and then I will hit

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.310 
spawning it again and then I will hit
this<00:02:18.970> trap<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.010> vote<00:02:21.220> right<00:02:21.520> now<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.390> um

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
this trap like I vote right now and um

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.000 
this trap like I vote right now and um
yeah<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.520> was<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.940> i<00:02:25.120> miss<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:26.020> mother<00:02:26.320> i<00:02:26.560> feel

that<00:02:27.250> that's<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.090> strategy<00:02:28.240> though<00:02:28.570> that's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
that that's the strategy though that's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.080 
that that's the strategy though that's
one<00:02:29.050> loop<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:30.280> I'm<00:02:30.460> some<00:02:30.730> stats<00:02:30.940> about

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
one loop of it now I'm some stats about

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.810 
one loop of it now I'm some stats about
this<00:02:31.300> game<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.140> lot<00:02:32.470> faster<00:02:32.920> than<00:02:33.370> my

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
this game it was a lot faster than my

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.090 
this game it was a lot faster than my
previous<00:02:34.060> best<00:02:34.780> game<00:02:35.050> on<00:02:35.290> Therese<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:35.920> which
