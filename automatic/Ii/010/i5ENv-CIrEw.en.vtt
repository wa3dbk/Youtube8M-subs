created by my bedazzled treasures on any
of<00:06:02.250> my<00:06:02.280> work<00:06:02.580> but<00:06:03.479> somebody<00:06:03.810> told<00:06:03.870> me<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.169> need

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
of my work but somebody told me I need

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.719 
of my work but somebody told me I need
to<00:06:04.380> start<00:06:04.590> doing<00:06:04.740> that<00:06:05.009> so<00:06:05.310> that's<00:06:05.490> why<00:06:05.699> that

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
to start doing that so that's why that

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.680 
to start doing that so that's why that
is<00:06:06.090> there<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.979> trick<00:06:08.280> on<00:06:08.599> using<00:06:09.599> the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
is there but the trick on using the

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.580 
is there but the trick on using the
wallpaper<00:06:10.169> is<00:06:11.300> that<00:06:12.300> you<00:06:12.539> have<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.169> take<00:06:13.409> it

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
wallpaper is that you have to take it

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.189 
wallpaper is that you have to take it
the<00:06:13.949> layer<00:06:14.190> off<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:15.389> know<00:06:15.509> the<00:06:15.630> part<00:06:15.900> that<00:06:16.050> you

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
the layer off you know the part that you

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.370 
the layer off you know the part that you
glue<00:06:16.500> on<00:06:16.740> to<00:06:17.219> the<00:06:17.690> like<00:06:18.690> so<00:06:18.900> you<00:06:18.990> were<00:06:19.110> gluing

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
glue on to the like so you were gluing

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.050 
glue on to the like so you were gluing
it<00:06:19.440> on<00:06:19.560> your<00:06:19.710> wall<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.130> wall<00:06:20.250> paper<00:06:20.520> has<00:06:20.849> a

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
it on your wall the wall paper has a

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.879 
it on your wall the wall paper has a
gluey<00:06:21.389> part<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:22.050> then<00:06:22.139> there's<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.650> other

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
gluey part and then there's the other

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.980 
gluey part and then there's the other
part<00:06:23.039> on<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.520> well<00:06:23.969> it<00:06:24.120> comes<00:06:24.419> in<00:06:24.630> two<00:06:24.780> layers

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
part on it well it comes in two layers

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.719 
part on it well it comes in two layers
that<00:06:25.380> you<00:06:25.500> have<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.830> take<00:06:26.039> that<00:06:26.069> first<00:06:26.460> layer

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
that you have to take that first layer

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.990 
that you have to take that first layer
off<00:06:27.090> or<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:27.630> won't<00:06:27.870> stick<00:06:28.169> and<00:06:28.530> I<00:06:29.400> did<00:06:29.849> discover

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
off or it won't stick and I did discover

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.790 
off or it won't stick and I did discover
that<00:06:30.479> when<00:06:30.659> I<00:06:30.690> was<00:06:30.900> doing<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.229> Mod<00:06:31.409> Podge<00:06:31.440> it

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
that when I was doing the Mod Podge it

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.550 
that when I was doing the Mod Podge it
wasn't<00:06:32.159> sticking<00:06:32.430> so<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.870> just<00:06:34.260> wanted<00:06:34.529> to

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560
