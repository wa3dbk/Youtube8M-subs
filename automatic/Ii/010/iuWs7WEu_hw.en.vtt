00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.410
 these images were obtained by tenants 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.539
 Russians and became public before the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.279
 end of the Soviet Union through 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.279
 defense minister under ethics 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.970
 these images were recorded in the cabin 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.290
 of a jet was about to intercept 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.290
 two unknown targets 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.650
 here we see clearly 12 flying targets 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.720
 slowly, certainly not 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.060
 similar to aircraft of the aeronautics or 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.370
 commercial aircraft or other aircraft 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.050
 we know of the June business 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.970
 contacts with these objects 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 never had any identification 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.340
 official 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.620
 the scene was filmed from a mig 25 foci 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.079
 bed that yielded by the Soviet government 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.480
 better known as m 16 focam 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.640
 Americans 200 meters ahead on the net 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.620
 what happens next is that a new object 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.890
 appears behind the clouds that is not 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.499
 identified the man simply descends 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.229
 disappearing between the clouds 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:10.859
 - here the American airplane in the same 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.469
 that the camera is 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:19.179
 then the object that appears behind the 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:25.539
 n 16 arises behind the aircraft making 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:27.399
 the same trajectory in 3d as all the 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.359
 observed evidence of UFOs is 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.920
 controversial 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.109
 the researchers strive to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.219
 clarify these facts related to the 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:39.729
 its true Indian origin and how 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.999
 more spectacular the more news 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.340
 deep is the official verification of the 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.549
 army intelligence for more than 30 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.669
 years but my son is part of the force 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.560
 Russian air carrier with certainty in many 

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:55.509
 occasions the cheeses 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.759
 Air Force and Navy intercept 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.329
 ship is that we were thinking of 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.419
 other countries but were not pigeon planes 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.380
 that we knew and did not belong to 

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:10.869
 no nation on earth is no longer 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.200
 novelty is that we have a young 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.659
 flying over us many authorities already 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.540
 have this information 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.950
 they are answers to many things 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.750
 however these answers are obtained 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.390
 the Soviets and Americans have 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.940
 clues to what these objects are 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.640
 I know it's very difficult to follow, but 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.099
 he came very close to us until four 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.290
 meters away but the planes that 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.290
 we have one is able to reach the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.170
 do not watch these planes 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.330
 here we have the vision of a camera 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.840
 installed in the cabin of the pilots of this 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.270
 instead of 1 and 21 is a strategic point 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.450
 to view the other aircraft on the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.410
 what we see today is one 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.660
 cylindrical object flying and when the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.940
 airplane approaches man accelerates in a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.940
 incredible speed disappears 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.050
 let's see again 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.880
 there is the cylindrical object with the same 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.520
 when he suddenly 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.590
 disappears scaffolding instruct reach 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.270
 accelerating the pilot would take 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.270
 less than 8 to 10 seconds 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.710
 many experiments were carried out 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.020
 to identify the shooting objective 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.070
 in this case the interception occurs without 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.600
 violence 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.660
 there are several apparitions of objects 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.140
 cylinders are being investigated 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.570
 they have an impressive acceleration the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.820
 approximately two 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.950
 times greater than m 21 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.200
 the technology that we and the Americans 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.350
 we have allowed us to achieve such 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.350
 velocity 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.489
 these images are incredible I know the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.600
 Russians have the same difficulties as 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.880
 us your artillery is as good as the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.550
 but we are both capable of 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.380
 intercept stores and their technologies 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.640
 superiors and that is why we 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.970
 disadvantage in the early 1990s 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.370
 occurred a tragic accident is the same in the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.040
 which 21 airplanes with pilots of various 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.910
 nationalities presented itself in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.910
 Russian territory 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.630
 all went well until the moment a 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.280
 of aircraft lost contact with the tower 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.280
 with other aircraft 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.360
 nobody knew what was happening 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.830
 some was a fatality 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.610
 until this is the exact moment of the collision 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 followed by a deafening noise 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.800
 the two pilots died suddenly the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.750
 which has left the authorities intrigued is 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.250
 that they were experienced officers 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.530
 but only after an investigation 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.449
 have discovered that the cause is not 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.530
 was accidental but had been hit 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.530
 by an unknown object
