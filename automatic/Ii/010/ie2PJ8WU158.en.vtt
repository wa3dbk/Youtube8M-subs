00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the wrong side so that the front will

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.799 
the wrong side so that the front will
look<00:00:55.500> nice<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> neat

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.760 

insert<00:00:59.809> your<00:00:59.840> needle<00:01:00.820> through<00:01:01.989> any<00:01:02.989> stitches

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510 

and<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:12.020> doesn't<00:01:12.380> really<00:01:12.530> matter<00:01:12.770> which<00:01:13.160> one

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
and it doesn't really matter which one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.440 
and it doesn't really matter which one
you<00:01:13.790> pick<00:01:14.230> because<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.380> goal<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.450> secure

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
you pick because the goal is to secure

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.370 
you pick because the goal is to secure
the<00:01:19.600> yarn<00:01:21.190> so<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:23.300> will<00:01:23.540> not<00:01:23.810> unravel<00:01:26.380> so

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
the yarn so that it will not unravel so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.040 
the yarn so that it will not unravel so
you<00:01:27.440> just<00:01:27.830> pick<00:01:28.130> any<00:01:29.050> stitches<00:01:30.340> from<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.370> back

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
you just pick any stitches from the back

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:42.670 
you just pick any stitches from the back
and<00:01:36.880> once<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.090> are<00:01:38.240> done<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:41.630> can<00:01:41.660> simply<00:01:42.229> cut

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
and once you are done you can simply cut

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:54.030 
and once you are done you can simply cut
off<00:01:42.710> any<00:01:43.310> remaining<00:01:43.760> yarn

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040
