00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.200
 hello then today we are you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.510
 had a product that will be pretty 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.779
 waited by gamers pc gamers 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 especially since we will present logitech 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 proteus g500 which is a mouse which 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 just replace the g500 s there is a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 bestseller which has been rated 5 stars by 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 our care during his test and we will see 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.560
 how does it differ from its old model 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.100
 and what it brings new 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.050
 logitech had tried to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.839
 to instill a scientific spirit in its 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.750
 mouse while on the protein 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.230
 we are more on a science fiction side 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.809
 with shaped buttons edges 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.260
 geometric and a lot more design 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.659
 worked as well in terms of lines 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.280
 than in terms of plastic texture in 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.869
 terms of prevention is always on 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.799
 something extremely qualitative 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.060
 as soon as you put your hand on the mouse 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.789
 the fingers naturally arise on the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.300
 important points buttons live and 502 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:16.840
 proteus integrates an arm processor and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.630
 the memory the processor works from 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.030
 together with the sensor and manages the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.250
 sensitivity of the mouse depending on the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.929
 coating on which is laid the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.990
 memory records the 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.830
 mackerel associated with the button the sensor 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.649
 protein rises up to 12,000 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.170
 country with an acceleration of 40g and a 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.119
 speed of 7.6 meters second 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.880
 so it's extremely fast 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.939
 extremely accurate another point 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.380
 In particular, we have a button for 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.829
 for the fps a button that will serve 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.979
 for snipers that goes considerably 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.920
 slow down the mouse it's a mouse that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.079
 is very well finished that incorporates as 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.789
 his big sister 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.520
 a small compartment to add 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.700
 weight so to know that this mouse 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.769
 still lighter than the g500's 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 coup we can add thirty or so 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.970
 grams in weight 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.200
 only negative point of the mouse is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.810
 that she is not ambidextrous 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.519
 so it will only be reserved for 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 two right handed boxes exactly 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.470
 just like his big sister 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.579
 are we going to crack the question can 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.579
 arise because for users 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.290
 the g500 s we do not think it's 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.870
 We truly win 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.250
 to pass on a 500 g 2 for the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.739
 people who are really looking for a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.019
 ultra precise evening for pure fps 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.690
 gaming and that he does not have a 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.220
 satisfactory equipment has clearly 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.620
 or 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.930
 it is a favorite and if we join 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.880
 to design and if one adheres to the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.260
 product philosophy it's clearly 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.750
 a product that we will be able to recommend 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.080
 and that every user will have fun 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.080
 use
