00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
hand and side by side to these other
devices<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.509> definitely<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
devices and it's definitely not going to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
devices and it's definitely not going to
be<00:01:16.770> easily<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.670> handable<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.390> with

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
be easily one handable for those with

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
be easily one handable for those with
small<00:01:18.810> hands<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.290> happen<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.830> larger

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
small hands I happen to have larger

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
small hands I happen to have larger
hands<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.390> fit<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:22.049> easily<00:01:22.290> in

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
hands so I can fit this pretty easily in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
hands so I can fit this pretty easily in
my<00:01:22.710> hand<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.880> device<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> also<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
my hand but this device is also going to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
my hand but this device is also going to
be<00:01:25.229> super<00:01:25.740> thin<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.610> help<00:01:26.880> your

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
be super thin so that will help your

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
be super thin so that will help your
hand<00:01:27.270> wrap<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
hand wrap around it so you do have a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
hand wrap around it so you do have a
larger<00:01:29.009> device<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.479> thin<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
larger device but it is very thin and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
larger device but it is very thin and
very<00:01:31.200> comparable<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> fifth-generation

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
have our cameras dual LED flash on the
iPhone<00:01:37.890> 5s<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.490> flash<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.329> remains<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.960> be

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
iPhone 5s a flash that remains to be

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.190 
iPhone 5s a flash that remains to be
seen<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> iPhone<00:01:41.460> 6<00:01:41.820> dummy<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:43.049> don't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
seen on the iPhone 6 dummy so we don't

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.539 
seen on the iPhone 6 dummy so we don't
exactly<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.649> what's<00:01:43.829> gonna<00:01:43.920> happen<00:01:44.189> there

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
exactly know what's gonna happen there

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
exactly know what's gonna happen there
but<00:01:44.579> right<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.630> dummy<00:01:45.899> devices<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
but right now on these dummy devices it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
but right now on these dummy devices it
looks<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.979> has<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> single<00:01:47.460> LED<00:01:47.880> flash

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
looks like it has a single LED flash

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
looks like it has a single LED flash
which<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.140> that's<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> be

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
which I don't know if that's going to be

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
which I don't know if that's going to be
the<00:01:49.740> case<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> final<00:01:50.790> design<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the case or not in the final design on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
the case or not in the final design on
the<00:01:51.780> side<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.290> our<00:01:52.500> sim<00:01:52.770> card<00:01:53.070> slots

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the side here we have our sim card slots

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
the side here we have our sim card slots
and<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.750> our<00:01:54.899> lock<00:01:55.170> button<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and we also do have our lock button on

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
and we also do have our lock button on
the<00:01:55.740> side<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> iPhone<00:01:56.969> 6<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.930> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the side of the iPhone 6 to make it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
the side of the iPhone 6 to make it
easier<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> press<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.430> hand<00:01:59.759> because

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
easier to press with one hand because

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.510 
easier to press with one hand because
the<00:02:00.420> screen<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.500> entire<00:02:01.860> body<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.369> so

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the screen and the entire body is so

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
the screen and the entire body is so
much<00:02:02.670> larger<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.390> makes<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.079> bit

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
much larger it makes it a little bit

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.660 
much larger it makes it a little bit
easier<00:02:04.560> instead<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.860> having<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> reach<00:02:05.250> over

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
easier instead of having to reach over

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
easier instead of having to reach over
to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> top<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> device<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.140> order<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to the top of the device in order to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
to the top of the device in order to
grab<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> other<00:02:08.640> side<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
grab that now on the other side we have

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.690 
grab that now on the other side we have
completely<00:02:09.959> redesigned<00:02:10.560> volume<00:02:10.979> buttons<00:02:11.310> we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
completely redesigned volume buttons we

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.640 
completely redesigned volume buttons we
have<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.060> oblong<00:02:12.629> design<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
have this oblong design as a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170 
have this oblong design as a
to<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.890> circular<00:02:14.280> design<00:02:14.430> found<00:02:14.849> on<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
to the circular design found on the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.960 
to the circular design found on the
iPhone<00:02:15.629> 5s<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.409> we<00:02:16.920> also<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.370> our<00:02:17.549> mute

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
iPhone 5s and we also have our mute

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
iPhone 5s and we also have our mute
switch<00:02:18.239> right<00:02:18.540> above<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.709> kind<00:02:19.890> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
switch right above that so that kind of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.069 
switch right above that so that kind of
gives<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.159> an<00:02:20.310> idea<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.760> exactly<00:02:21.269> how<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
gives you an idea of exactly how it's

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.539 
gives you an idea of exactly how it's
gonna<00:02:22.200> look<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.590> these<00:02:22.769> buttons<00:02:23.189> on<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
gonna look and these buttons on the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.600 
gonna look and these buttons on the
iPhone<00:02:23.909> 6<00:02:24.209> dummy<00:02:24.599> are<00:02:24.870> very<00:02:25.230> similar<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
iPhone 6 dummy are very similar to the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.860 
iPhone 6 dummy are very similar to the
buttons<00:02:26.909> found<00:02:27.060> on<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> fifth-generation

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
buttons found on the fifth-generation

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.740 
buttons found on the fifth-generation
iPod<00:02:28.470> touch<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.189> that<00:02:29.370> means<00:02:29.579> anything<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.329> you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
iPod touch if that means anything as you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
iPod touch if that means anything as you
can<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.079> this<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.530> obviously<00:02:32.159> a<00:02:32.280> much<00:02:32.640> thinner

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
can see this is obviously a much thinner

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.410 
can see this is obviously a much thinner
device<00:02:33.450> than<00:02:34.109> Apple's<00:02:34.680> iPhone<00:02:35.099> 5s<00:02:35.609> which<00:02:35.819> kind

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
device than Apple's iPhone 5s which kind

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.000 
device than Apple's iPhone 5s which kind
of<00:02:36.510> gets<00:02:36.659> me<00:02:36.780> excited<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.409> then<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
of gets me excited but then you know I

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.339 
of gets me excited but then you know I
kind<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.579> worry<00:02:38.790> about<00:02:39.090> maybe<00:02:39.329> dropping<00:02:40.079> it

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
kind of worry about maybe dropping it

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.619 
kind of worry about maybe dropping it
more<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.829> it's<00:02:41.189> thinner<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.000> overall<00:02:42.239> in

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
more because it's thinner but overall in

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.259 
more because it's thinner but overall in
my<00:02:42.689> hand<00:02:43.109> this<00:02:43.470> dummy<00:02:43.739> unit<00:02:44.159> doesn't<00:02:44.579> feel<00:02:44.970> too

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
my hand this dummy unit doesn't feel too

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.420 
my hand this dummy unit doesn't feel too
bad<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.049> we<00:02:46.139> have<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> dummy<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bad so here we have the dummy next to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.149 
bad so here we have the dummy next to
the<00:02:47.639> fifth-generation<00:02:48.209> iPod<00:02:48.989> touch<00:02:49.590> both<00:02:49.889> in

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
the fifth-generation iPod touch both in

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.099 
the fifth-generation iPod touch both in
space<00:02:50.579> gray<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.450> will<00:02:51.599> give<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> good

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
space gray and this will give you a good

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.949 
space gray and this will give you a good
idea<00:02:52.139> on<00:02:52.500> how<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.340> compares<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.359> far<00:02:54.870> as

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
idea on how this compares as far as

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.470 
idea on how this compares as far as
design<00:02:55.109> goes<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.859> apple's<00:02:56.340> ipod<00:02:56.700> touch<00:02:56.970> it's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
design goes to apple's ipod touch it's

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.690 
design goes to apple's ipod touch it's
just<00:02:57.989> about<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.470> thin<00:02:58.889> as<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.579> right

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
just about as thin as you can see right

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.369 
just about as thin as you can see right
here<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.939> have<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> same<00:03:00.389> style<00:03:00.689> volume

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
here we have the same style volume

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
cases they are said to be designed using

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.960 
cases they are said to be designed using
these<00:03:30.780> actual<00:03:31.349> mock-ups<00:03:31.949> so<00:03:32.459> as<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.849> would

device and it'll give you a good idea on

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.280 
device and it'll give you a good idea on
how<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.889> iPhone<00:03:38.459> 6<00:03:38.790> might<00:03:39.180> look<00:03:39.569> with<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> case

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290

if<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.769> design<00:03:41.159> happens<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.150> real<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:42.720> we

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
if this design happens to be real so we

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.020 
if this design happens to be real so we
have<00:03:43.379> perfect<00:03:43.590> fitting<00:03:44.040> volume<00:03:44.549> buttons<00:03:44.879> as

there for the mute switch moving along
to<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.959> bottom<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.349> we<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.739> pretty<00:03:50.129> much

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to the bottom that we have pretty much

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.219 
to the bottom that we have pretty much
exactly<00:03:50.639> what<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.090> would<00:03:51.180> expect<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.720> cutout

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
exactly what you would expect a cutout

exactly what you would expect a cutout
for<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.620> Lightning<00:03:53.069> connector<00:03:53.190> the

headphone jack and the speaker and what
appears<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.129> be<00:03:56.220> two<00:03:56.579> microphone<00:03:57.329> holes<00:03:57.629> now

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
appears to be two microphone holes now
