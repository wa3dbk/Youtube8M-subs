it because it's got great features it's
good<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:27.860> air-cooled<00:02:28.540> overclocking<00:02:29.540> it's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
good for air-cooled overclocking it's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.330 
good for air-cooled overclocking it's
really<00:02:30.200> reliable<00:02:31.390> get<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> solid<00:02:32.690> power<00:02:33.340> supply

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
really reliable get a solid power supply

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.890 
really reliable get a solid power supply

say<00:02:39.770> two<00:02:39.830> three<00:02:40.220> ports<00:02:41.320> enough<00:02:42.320> PCI<00:02:42.739> Express

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
say two three ports enough PCI Express

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.550 
say two three ports enough PCI Express
port<00:02:43.580> older<00:02:43.940> although<00:02:44.870> they<00:02:45.050> are<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:45.350> two

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
port older although they are just two

port older although they are just two
point<00:02:45.800> oh<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.100> that's<00:02:46.250> good<00:02:46.550> enough<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:47.630> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
point oh but that's good enough going to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.009 
point oh but that's good enough going to
be<00:02:47.810> using<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:49.030> 7870<00:02:50.030> from<00:02:50.840> asus<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
be using it with a 7870 from asus and

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.270 
be using it with a 7870 from asus and
for<00:02:54.019> now<00:02:54.110> i'll<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.470> using<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:55.160> FX<00:02:56.120> 8150

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
for now i'll be using a FX 8150

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.090 
for now i'll be using a FX 8150
bulldozer<00:02:58.280> processor<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.620> as<00:03:00.620> soon<00:03:00.739> as<00:03:00.920> the

bulldozer processor and as soon as the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.560 
bulldozer processor and as soon as the
new<00:03:01.250> pile<00:03:01.489> driver<00:03:01.760> comes<00:03:02.030> out<00:03:02.209> I'm<00:03:02.360> going<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
new pile driver comes out I'm going to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.850 
new pile driver comes out I'm going to
try<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.290> see<00:03:03.590> how<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.100> our<00:03:04.430> clocks<00:03:05.860> ok

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
try that and see how that our clocks ok

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.880 
try that and see how that our clocks ok
