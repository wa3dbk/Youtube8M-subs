00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 fresh from china arrived with us 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.420
 the number one s 6 e plus that is the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 very first clone of the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.639
 and we pack this together today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.109
 from Namborn is very well known for her 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 samsung clones and so they have already 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 various galaxy devices cloned it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.340
 four the s5 was also the galaxy note 4 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 and everyone looked very much alike 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.340
 like the original one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 however , they came to a great deal 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.189
 cheap price on the market and so is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.290
 it is also the case here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 the number one sexy one costs just 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 119 dollars in china and that is 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.000
 really an extremely good price like us 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 will see soon 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 we do not have android 5.0 here 5.1 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 So halfway up to date the mediatek 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 mt 65 82 quad core processor four cores 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 2g 3g but no lte at the price 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 not surprising either 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.949
 from a five-megapixel camera 16 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 megapixel rear 5 2 hd display 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.270
 Of course not like that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.220
 high resolution like the galaxy s 6 1 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 gigabyte of RAM 16 gb memory 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.180
 built-in and can not be 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 expand so are the technical 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 data as I said 119 euro dollar 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.210
 but the eurocourse is about that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.369
 Almost 11 and that's the way it is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 translate we look at the device 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.580
 just more accurate and at first 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 view 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 it's harder than the number one 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.189
 Devices resourceful feels good 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.049
 very briefly to the side 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 we'll be right back again 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.549
 only really very much behind it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.549
 interesting that we still have in here 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.890
 The box already contains a charger 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.840
 new items, looks a lot like samsung 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 but it is a bit slimmer 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 I have the impression we have here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 an output of 5.3 volts unusual 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.079
 otherwise in the five and 1000 milliamps okay 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 So it's not the fastest 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.469
 adapter and this is still a fancy 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 Charging cable micro usb on usb is now 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.049
 not the highest quality workmanship 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.300
 but goes well 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.980
 and there's a user manual 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 in English in tiny tiny smaller 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.550
 It will be hard without glasses 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
 I would say the whole thing to read like that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.220
 no Chinese only have English the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 very good 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.250
 we put everything aside and look 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.110
 finally the smartphone 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.880
 I turn on the display 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.709
 so that we look at it the same 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.750
 But first let's go around 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.370
 the device around and I have to say to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.860
 from the very first feelings 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.180
 I could not tell if I did 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.980
 the two devices are not next to each other 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.410
 I do not have now in the case 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.690
 I did not blindly know her 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.470
 It just feels great 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.989
 on to this aluminum housing that is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 really like one to one 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.040
 galaxy s 6 we walk around here once 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.230
 here are two keys good solid 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.350
 nothing shakes or creaks 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.239
 also here this notch is available 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
 really very chic feels 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.050
 solid at the bottom the same connections 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.239
 again this hole for the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.150
 speaker on the right side sim 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.750
 card slot power button pretty 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.459
 enjoyable 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.680
 Here, too, one has very much to that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.310
 galaxy r 6 cold and we see too 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.380
 top microphone and an infrared board around 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.510
 of course, the TV or what 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.150
 whatsoever to steer back, too 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.160
 Here one has paid attention to glass 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.720
 use so front and back is glass 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 but probably no god or 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.600
 glass we have the 16 megapixel here 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.170
 camera a led flash and what do we see 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.590
 here 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.840
 There looks a lot for a heart rate monitor 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.109
 So you have respected and 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.640
 As you can see it shimmers here 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.019
 so a little bit in the light so nice too 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.810
 sanded and I have to say that 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.359
 Workmanship is extremely good 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.299
 it is very high quality in the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.359
 hand on is not that hard not so 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.900
 easy has a very high quality feeling 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.680
 and honestly, I could as well 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.459
 the hump 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.530
 they really stuck to everything 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.750
 for this smartphone to feel like 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.250
 a samsung galaxy s ex really very 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.209
 impressive if you have that in hand 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.400
 holds so long as the display is not 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.680
 Turns it really looks like 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.109
 the garrigues 46 cent notes then exactly 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.230
 of course, the display is not quite 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.760
 so independent of perspective 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.730
 we have a lower resolution here 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.980
 with 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.350
 As a result, writing is a bit more robust 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.050
 if you go a little closer to the display 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.640
 and the display is not laminated either 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.740
 that's what he calls a small layer of air 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.640
 and reflected by it was clear 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.110
 stronger 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.300
 Let's take a look at the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.010
 user interface and there we see 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.840
 a kind of touchwiz as you would expect from 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.040
 Samsung smartphones knows mixed one 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.800
 to the right then we have here 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.720
 flipboard and the original pinball machine 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.760
 that you are elsewhere in the place 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.830
 you can download here in the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.560
 apps because we really have the same 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.390
 Icons for the most part as synonymous with samsung 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.580
 smartphones, however, is the whole thing 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.820
 a bit not so here 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.740
 place felt so at least yes you see 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.190
 the wiping gestures do not work 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.150
 always perfect you break under then 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.670
 you have the fast here too 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.900
 attitude and here it can be finer 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.180
 and so on 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.180
 Of course, this one is not original 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.650
 is so let's test in the browser 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.940
 so a bit the browser performance 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.640
 You can see that it is not the 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.070
 original samsung browser so you look 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.890
 closer then you can see that already 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.990
 It's not quite the same thing 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.040
 here the on the left side the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.020
 are a bit left here 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.220
 moved up though I actually here 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.710
 there would still be room 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.690
 the camera is of course not quite like that 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.060
 well we have a 16 megapixel here 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.620
 Camera and you see that also solves 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.180
 a bit slow when I'm there 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.400
 auftrete 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.050
 there is the galaxy s ex but around worlds 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.180
 faster and here we have one more 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.160
 few modes so you look more closely 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.380
 then you can tell in any case that is 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.090
 a little too because of the missing logos 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.310
 I honestly have to confess to you 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.480
 That never makes it sexy in the left hand 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.370
 press and in the right I would have 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.850
 that it will be six and both eyes 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.410
 connected 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.600
 I could not distinguish her like that 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.870
 good is this clown of course you can see 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.660
 At the logos that it is not the real s6 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.850
 But it is from the feeling of the 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.710
 It's really a workmanship 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.440
 very perfect clown and the whole for 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.750
 119 US dollars in china currently 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.910
 available that was unboxing to 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.920
 number one it sexy my question to you 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.010
 would you be the number one it 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.070
 sexy or the original samsung galaxy s 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.180
 6 buy 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.950
 write down a comment below 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.870
 I am looking forward to this discussion 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.640
 otherwise, as always, it means thumbs up 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.870
 if you liked the video and 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.790
 See you next time I am 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.790
 to see one of Bernanke's
