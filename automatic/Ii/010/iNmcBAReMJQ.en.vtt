explain why you may want to use it

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.640 
explain why you may want to use it
there's<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.809> three<00:00:12.840> parts<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
there's actually three parts to the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.259 
there's actually three parts to the
script<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.160> here's<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.549> script<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.059> its

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
script so here's the script in its

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269 
script so here's the script in its
entirety<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.039> two

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
entirety and you can see it's two

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.670 
entirety and you can see it's two
aliases<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> +<00:00:18.150> jump<00:00:18.449> throw<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.900> then<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> -<00:00:19.410> jump

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
aliases a + jump throw and then a - jump

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
aliases a + jump throw and then a - jump
throw<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.210> third<00:00:21.420> command<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
throw and then the third command is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390 
throw and then the third command is
simply<00:00:22.199> binding<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.220> were<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
simply binding it so if you were to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
simply binding it so if you were to
enter<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.789> into<00:00:24.000> console<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.689> would<00:00:24.840> be

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
enter this into console that would be

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
enter this into console that would be
the<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.289> command<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:26.430> would<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the first command this would be the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.580 
the first command this would be the
second<00:00:27.150> command<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.230> bind<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
second command and then you just bind it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.320 
second command and then you just bind it
to<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> key<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> something<00:00:30.090> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to a key and this is something you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
to a key and this is something you
should<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.779> your<00:00:30.810> autoexec<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> plan

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
should put in your autoexec if you plan

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
should put in your autoexec if you plan
to<00:00:31.890> use<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.669> never<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> input

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to use that way you never have to input

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
to use that way you never have to input
these<00:00:33.600> commands<00:00:33.930> again<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.130> be

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
these commands again and you can just be

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
these commands again and you can just be
done<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.140> can

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
done with it and what they do you can

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720 
done with it and what they do you can
see<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.649> basically<00:00:37.920> doing<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> jump<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
see here it's basically doing a jump and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.750 
see here it's basically doing a jump and
an<00:00:38.879> attack<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> same<00:00:40.469> time<00:00:40.760> but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
an attack at basically the same time but

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920 
an attack at basically the same time but
you'll<00:00:41.910> notice<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.450> actually<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you'll notice that it's actually it's a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
you'll notice that it's actually it's a
negative<00:00:43.110> attack<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> means<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
negative attack and what that means is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.440 
negative attack and what that means is
it's<00:00:45.059> basically<00:00:45.480> releasing<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> key<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it's basically releasing the key and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
it's basically releasing the key and
I'll<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:49.289> sense<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> second<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I'll make sense here in a second when I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
I'll make sense here in a second when I
show<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> once<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.320> those<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
show it to you so once you get those in

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.110 
show it to you so once you get those in
you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> found<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.489> saw<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> me

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you have it found you saw there for me

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760 
you have it found you saw there for me
it's<00:00:54.270> bound<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> H<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.289> hit<00:00:55.559> H

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it's bound to H and if I just hit H

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
it's bound to H and if I just hit H
you'll<00:00:55.980> notice<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.610> making<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:57.000> jump

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you'll notice it's just making me jump

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
you'll notice it's just making me jump
I'm<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.140> throwing<00:00:58.559> anything<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
I'm not actually throwing anything to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.369 
I'm not actually throwing anything to
actually<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> script<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
actually use the script what you need to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
actually use the script what you need to
do<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> click<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.219> pull<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> pin<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
do is click and pull the pin and then in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
do is click and pull the pin and then in
wherever<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> aim<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.189> hit

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
wherever you want to aim and then hit

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
wherever you want to aim and then hit
your<00:01:05.460> jump<00:01:05.790> throw<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> you'll<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.140> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
your jump throw and you'll see that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
your jump throw and you'll see that
it'll<00:01:07.500> it'll<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> same<00:01:08.369> every<00:01:09.060> single

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it'll it'll be the same every single

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
it'll it'll be the same every single
time<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.229> behavior<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> that's<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
time so on your behavior and that's the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
time so on your behavior and that's the
main<00:01:12.360> reason<00:01:12.540> you'd<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.409> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
main reason you'd want to use it it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
main reason you'd want to use it it's
obviously<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.340> important<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.450> very

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
obviously very important to have very

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
obviously very important to have very
consistent<00:01:16.290> throws

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
consistent throws

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.920 
consistent throws
especially<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.479> smoking<00:01:18.659> off

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
especially when you're smoking off

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
especially when you're smoking off
certain<00:01:19.140> areas<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> certain<00:01:19.860> maps<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
certain areas of certain maps and that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
certain areas of certain maps and that's
the<00:01:20.939> reason<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.299> seeing<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.869> jump

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the reason we're seeing this use jump

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
the reason we're seeing this use jump
throw<00:01:22.470> without<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> script<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> super<00:01:23.850> super

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
throw without the script is super super

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
know for a fact this is being used in

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
know for a fact this is being used in
leagues<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.009> both<00:01:32.159> North<00:01:32.430> America<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> in
