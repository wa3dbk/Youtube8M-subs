00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
convinced we could be entering

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.120 
convinced we could be entering
hyperinflation<00:00:06.000> here<00:00:06.870> domestically<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.830> you

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
hyperinflation here domestically and you

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.890 
hyperinflation here domestically and you
know<00:00:08.250> we've<00:00:08.460> heard<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.970> talk<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.870> a

know we've heard this talk now for a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.930 
know we've heard this talk now for a
decade<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:11.040> just<00:00:11.309> haven't<00:00:11.610> seen<00:00:11.790> any

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
decade and we just haven't seen any

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.999 
decade and we just haven't seen any
signs<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.509> hyperinflation<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.710> think

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
signs of hyperinflation do you think

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.499 
signs of hyperinflation do you think
that<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.280> time<00:00:14.490> around<00:00:14.549> he<00:00:15.000> might<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.480> to

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
that this time around he might be on to

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.060 
that this time around he might be on to
something<00:00:15.660> well<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.410> don't<00:00:16.529> really<00:00:16.770> see

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
something well you don't really see

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
something well you don't really see
signs<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.580> hyperinflation<00:00:18.000> until<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:18.960> hit

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
signs of hyperinflation until they hit

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.130 
signs of hyperinflation until they hit
and<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> course<00:00:19.830> too<00:00:20.490> late<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.689> think

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and then of course too late but I think

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.800 
and then of course too late but I think
that<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.890> continue<00:00:23.760> along<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.510> path<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
that if we continue along the path that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.950 
that if we continue along the path that
were<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.289> now<00:00:26.090> hyperinflation<00:00:27.090> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
were on now hyperinflation is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
were on now hyperinflation is
unfortunately<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> happen<00:00:30.359> so

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
unfortunately what is going to happen so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.500 
unfortunately what is going to happen so
in<00:00:30.990> order<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> avoid<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.399> outcome<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:33.329> need

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
in order to avoid that outcome we need

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.799 
in order to avoid that outcome we need
to<00:00:33.630> change<00:00:33.899> policy<00:00:34.649> 180<00:00:35.250> degrees<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.570> far

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to change policy 180 degrees and so far

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.150 
to change policy 180 degrees and so far
there's<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.110> indication<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.100> going

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
there's no indication that that is going

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190 
there's no indication that that is going
to<00:00:38.430> happen<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> still<00:00:39.540> hope<00:00:39.899> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to happen but you can still hope that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
to happen but you can still hope that
when<00:00:40.410> push<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.920> comes<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.460> shove<00:00:41.700> when

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
when push really comes to shove when

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
when push really comes to shove when
their<00:00:42.180> bachelor<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> wall<00:00:43.050> our<00:00:43.440> leaders

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
their bachelor to the wall our leaders

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
their bachelor to the wall our leaders
will<00:00:44.100> finally<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.760> willing<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
will finally be willing to make the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
will finally be willing to make the
tough<00:00:45.750> choices<00:00:45.980> although<00:00:46.980> they'll<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.309> far

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tough choices although they'll be far

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
tough choices although they'll be far
tougher<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.840> waited<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.350> long

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
tougher because they waited so long

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
tougher because they waited so long
because<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.300> exacerbated<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> problem<00:00:51.420> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because they exacerbated the problem so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
because they exacerbated the problem so
much<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.620> looking<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> horrific

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
much so we are looking at a horrific

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
much so we are looking at a horrific
economic<00:00:54.300> outcome<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.440> avoid<00:00:55.829> hyperinflation

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
economic outcome to avoid hyperinflation

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
economic outcome to avoid hyperinflation
the<00:00:57.180> type<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> recession<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.379> going

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the type of recession that we're going

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
the type of recession that we're going
to<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> endure<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.670> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> be

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to have to endure is going to be

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
to have to endure is going to be
staggering<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.710> many<00:01:01.920> ways<00:01:02.010> worse<00:01:02.489> than

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
staggering and in many ways worse than

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
staggering and in many ways worse than
the<00:01:02.820> Great<00:01:03.000> Depression<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.530> the

the Great Depression because of what the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.230 
the Great Depression because of what the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
government is done but it's imperative

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.149 
government is done but it's imperative
that<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.950> void

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that we do that and in void

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.000 
that we do that and in void
hyperinflation<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> outcome<00:01:10.290> will

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hyperinflation because that outcome will

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.830 
hyperinflation because that outcome will
be<00:01:11.040> even<00:01:11.490> worse<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> the
