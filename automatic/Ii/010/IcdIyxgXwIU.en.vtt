it hit enter your amp I will reboot and
but<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.350> would<00:02:36.500> kick<00:02:37.010> me<00:02:37.220> out<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.520> stream<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.150> I

but it would kick me out the stream so I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:48.940 
but it would kick me out the stream so I
guess<00:02:39.320> that's<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.800> end<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> bye<00:02:47.709> all<00:02:48.709> right

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
at the moment down there somewhere and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:07.630 
at the moment down there somewhere and
so<00:02:59.060> Mac<00:02:59.239> command<00:02:59.600> again<00:03:04.150> USB<00:03:05.150> HID<00:03:06.220> mouse<00:03:07.220> poke

so Mac command again USB HID mouse poke
equals<00:03:08.630> zero<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.640> should<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:10.940> a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
equals zero and then you should have a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.640 
equals zero and then you should have a
nice<00:03:12.370> speedy<00:03:13.370> I
