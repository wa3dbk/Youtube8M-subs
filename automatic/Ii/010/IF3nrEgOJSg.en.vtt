00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.910
 Guangzhou's 

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:10.090
 Though it is video 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 I would like to introduce three points to stabilize the pen holder back block 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.670
 I will 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.200
 Though it is about three points immediately 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.410
 At first it is grip 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.710
 Spey at the time of packing this grip 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.060
 Thumb up 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:30.670
 I'm going to take it off I'm going to take it off 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.670
 First of all this is one, next 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.870
 Remove the clip 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.829
 head 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.920
 Slightly 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.310
 It means that I will raise it up diagonally 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.180
 This is the second 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.910
 Three eyes 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.290
 From above 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.730
 I will hold it down 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.730
 Is It is the third place Tteyuu 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.580
 2 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.580
 th 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.130
 Hmm 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.970
 I will 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.970
 ph 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.909
 Hmm 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.909
 ban 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.990
 Yes 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.470
 After all 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.640
 I can not keep hitting with the pen holder 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.670
 It will be absolutely necessary to protect this backblock 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.759
 If it says that time, it is Korokoromisu 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.330
 I feel that I have to decide when I hit a well, so I get embarrassed and the score rate goes down 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.700
 I will 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:44.049
 After all the pen holder who was at the top of the world 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 After Kim Tex players and three leading players are players around 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.950
 Well have in common also to type using a short table th 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.050
 It is that back block is that it is very hard 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.230
 So this backblock or skin backblock 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.370
 By all means in the will become an essential technology 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.370
 Please try incorporating
