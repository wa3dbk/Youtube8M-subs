 book video crazy you can go like 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.690
 time is running fast and today I wanted 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 do another video initially but then 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 I have such a super festive 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.869
 mood yourself into your hands and roses and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 I saw that the team 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.990
 epicrisis and finally honor 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:35.149
 meet last year came out new 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.469
 video I decided that today the question 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 in addition to this at the end of the video you expect 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.510
 one edge short surprise 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.300
 cozy fly to the end let's begin 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.640
 rather stepan scene eight questions i don't 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 wrong and the first question is if you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.739
 could invite one author and one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
 the hero of this author start whom would you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.570
 invited and so you handed them shake 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 in some of harry potter russian 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 tag if I'm not mistaken, I invited to 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.270
 tea 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.850
 lady tarot yes this time I decided that I 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.290
 invite damn rouling and hermione because 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.939
 what I will show wanted to talk to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.939
 Hermione it seems such a man 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.369
 which erupted in itself but in reality 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.799
 matters wishing to communicate with somehow with 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.590
 surrounding world so yes john ron and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.810
 hermione the second question is which book would we 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 They wanted the author to write a joke and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 here I think without thinking 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.320
 saying that this is a gene flin and and disappeared 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.630
 because he really wanted to know 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 story for example in terms of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 parents or maybe in terms of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.619
 someone from friends or family acquaintances 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.979
 or we, in principle , to deepen even more 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.960
 to the world and the brain of the main character because 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.939
 her diary and that we read, and of course 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 gives us a lot of information about how she 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.930
 lived in childhood and so on but anyway 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.490
 some such spaces remain 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 so many questions after reading 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 why not and yes with please 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.110
 add the story of the disappeared 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.660
 still 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.460
 the third question which heroes were from 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.710
 different books you think you would get 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 great pair over this matter 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.420
 Vegetables 2 years she decided to end 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.759
 a result that Mom Tris in Divergent and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 natalia and fitzwilliam darsi out of pride 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.700
 and prejudice j8 and winter turned 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.230
 great couple because she's all like that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.420
 stern object equals 9 woman with a bunch 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.340
 secrets of women with their secrets 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.350
 but you know this family 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.209
 a man some kind of clerk even he 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.550
 no less severe because such a hector too 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.230
 mule closed ready open in 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.850
 some kind of communication so yes me 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.860
 chestnuts got two great pair 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.260
 the next fourth question is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.910
 if you stumbled upon your loved one 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 author in the subway and could say no 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.910
 just one sentence for you to say 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.070
 and who the author would be I am shorter on the case 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.959
 bump into the hands of the throne elevator program and 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.970
 ask her when you next part about 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.380
 pockets customization and is it going 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.810
 start something else about Grig morning 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.100
 because i really want that world harry 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.700
 potter question what book did you 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.340
 the reader and why I don't know exactly which one 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.709
 or made me readers in childhood I 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.260
 I think that my mother made me a reader but 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.330
 if we talk about my return to this 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.180
 the role let's say that happened somewhere 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.870
 in the first year it will be 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 The Canterbury Tales 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.970
 what sarah and later it will be hungry 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.000
 games because precisely because of these 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.840
 the work I got again you know 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.630
 such a kick charge desire to read a lot and 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.380
 read and just principle yes read so 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.299
 what and hungry train golf 6 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.390
 too scary my past in general 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.120
 ask such but your bookshelf in 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.250
 ram what book you really save 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.320
 the first thing I would start saving in a fire 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.540
 these are hundred percent documents because 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.500
 restore it all this horror 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.700
 get the first time it's all pretty 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.800
 personal hard you want paper with 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.810
 british martvili is here therefore better 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.940
 documents save but if all the same 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.140
 I need to save some more book 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.600
 save the zodiac 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.780
 robert cray smith because look 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.180
 then you don't want this book to save it and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.980
 leave all documents next 7 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.800
 spaces of the city ​​or in some way 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.290
 frightening but in what anti-utopian 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.530
 the world did you go to live and why about the very 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.750
 really live in the world of this top especially here 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.579
 see she's a fortuneteller walked around the swamp because 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.610
 the first thing that can not be immediately 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.080
 think it is not I would not like the principle 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.820
 because it seems to me excessively 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.220
 cruel more carefully 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.860
 as I understood in all decal utopia 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.280
 be traced one such clear clearly 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.590
 think 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.150
 if you have money then you basically 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.700
 more porridge live in any of these worlds 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.090
 so I would probably quietly wish 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.270
 days which in his times of peace or 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.910
 turned out to be the part of the divergent about which 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.490
 we learn a little later so to speak in order to 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.410
 no spoilers all report yes to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.900
 principle invite utopian worlds can 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.229
 live well the main thing is to know where to live well and 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.000
 the last question is your most epic 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.450
 read all the time if you can say so 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.700
 what is the most epic you read and tong 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.800
 I just can not say what most 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.650
 epic that i thought refreshment is harry 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.540
 potter because the world is harry's universe then 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.820
 that made john rolings to millions 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.790
 people around the world this present 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.960
 magic because harry potter and the world 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.090
 harry potter it please 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.010
 literary so gentle thing about which i 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.919
 really miss that HIV is not 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.560
 enough and the thing the continuation of which I 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.390
 I would really like to read let it be there 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.220
 anything three pages 5 pages i 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.150
 read anything to release 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.280
 in the role 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.200
 there was some more of this chic and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 beautiful magic here so i have 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.580
 It turned out and the case of the child you liked 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.770
