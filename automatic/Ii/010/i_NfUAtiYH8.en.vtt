technician any particular reason why you
chose<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.570> well<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.190> dentists<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
chose this well I think the dentists in

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.119 
chose this well I think the dentists in
our<00:00:54.210> training<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.260> focused<00:00:55.770> towards

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
our training are really focused towards

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
our training are really focused towards
all<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> technical<00:00:56.850> aspects<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.510> Dentistry

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
all the technical aspects of Dentistry

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.400 
all the technical aspects of Dentistry
and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.520> really<00:01:00.000> I'd<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.170> give<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and I think really I'd like to give a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
and I think really I'd like to give a
lecture<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.770> techniques<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.609> I'd<00:01:02.699> also

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
lecture about techniques but I'd also

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
lecture about techniques but I'd also
like<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> focus<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> artistry<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.320> well

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like to focus on the artistry as well

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
like to focus on the artistry as well
because<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.770> that's<00:01:05.009> an<00:01:05.190> area<00:01:05.369> that's

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
because I think that's an area that's

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.359 
because I think that's an area that's
really<00:01:05.700> missed<00:01:06.710> okay<00:01:07.710> say<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.280> all

so<00:04:28.960> that's<00:04:29.560> quite<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.800> big<00:04:29.949> claim<00:04:30.160> let's<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.669> a

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
so that's quite a big claim let's have a

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.719 
so that's quite a big claim let's have a
look<00:04:30.880> at<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> case<00:04:31.270> this<00:04:32.229> is<00:04:32.410> Laura<00:04:32.710> or<00:04:33.250> rather

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
look at a case this is Laura or rather

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.529 
look at a case this is Laura or rather
this<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.180> Laura's<00:04:34.900> upper<00:04:35.319> right<00:04:35.530> quadrant<00:04:36.539> as

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
this is Laura's upper right quadrant as

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.290 
this is Laura's upper right quadrant as
you<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.870> see<00:04:38.020> Laura<00:04:38.410> has<00:04:38.919> had<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.789> root<00:04:40.030> canal

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
you can see Laura has had a root canal

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.930 
you can see Laura has had a root canal
therapy<00:04:40.710> she<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.979> don't<00:04:42.190> do<00:04:42.400> root<00:04:42.639> canal

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
therapy she I don't do root canal

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.010 
therapies I'm kind of dangerous in pulp
chambers<00:04:45.370> so<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.910> refer<00:04:46.240> all<00:04:46.389> my<00:04:46.539> root<00:04:46.780> canal

very minimal the way we did the

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
restoration using the electric handpiece

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.529 
restoration using the electric handpiece
I<00:05:29.110> like<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.409> use<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.740> nsk<00:05:30.250> five<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:31.060> one<00:05:31.210> speed

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
I like to use the nsk five to one speed

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.270 
I like to use the nsk five to one speed
increasing<00:05:32.110> electric<00:05:32.470> handpiece<00:05:32.889> for<00:05:33.159> this

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
increasing electric handpiece for this

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.490 
increasing electric handpiece for this
because<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.880> precision<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.349> would

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
because of the precision and that would

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.700 
because of the precision and that would
leave<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.740> tiny<00:05:36.280> smear<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.380> temporary<00:05:38.380> cement

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
leave a tiny smear of temporary cement

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.370 
leave a tiny smear of temporary cement
around<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.460> outside<00:05:39.880> of<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.120> cavity<00:05:40.539> I<00:05:40.750> then

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
around the outside of the cavity I then

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.980 
around the outside of the cavity I then
removed<00:05:41.889> that<00:05:42.130> with<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.370> scaler<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.210> then<00:05:43.659> air

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
removed that with a scaler and then air

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.290 
removed that with a scaler and then air
abraded<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.620> cavity<00:05:45.039> with<00:05:45.219> 27<00:05:45.880> micron

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
abraded the cavity with 27 micron

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.350 
abraded the cavity with 27 micron
alumina<00:05:46.840> so<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.830> actually<00:05:48.370> did<00:05:48.820> no<00:05:49.120> more

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
alumina so I actually did no more

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.390 
alumina so I actually did no more
preparation<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:50.289> my<00:05:50.409> endodontist<00:05:51.159> had

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
preparation that my endodontist had

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.399 
preparation that my endodontist had
already<00:05:51.669> done<00:05:52.289> so<00:05:53.289> it's<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.530> very<00:05:53.740> minimal<00:05:54.070> prep

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
already done so it's a very minimal prep

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.050 
already done so it's a very minimal prep
we<00:05:56.409> then<00:05:56.590> applied<00:05:56.889> then<00:05:57.099> team<00:05:57.310> bonding<00:05:57.699> agent

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
we then applied then team bonding agent

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.330 
we then applied then team bonding agent
I<00:05:58.120> used<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.449> fourth-generation<00:05:59.159> dentin<00:06:00.159> team

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
I used a fourth-generation dentin team

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.249 
I used a fourth-generation dentin team
bonding<00:06:00.669> agent<00:06:01.000> for<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:01.210> case<00:06:01.479> so<00:06:01.719> we<00:06:01.750> etched

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
bonding agent for this case so we etched

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.820 
bonding agent for this case so we etched
washed<00:06:03.210> primed<00:06:04.210> as<00:06:04.599> a<00:06:04.780> separate<00:06:05.229> stage<00:06:05.530> and

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
washed primed as a separate stage and

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.430 
washed primed as a separate stage and
then<00:06:06.250> placed<00:06:06.490> our<00:06:06.699> adhesive<00:06:07.270> then<00:06:07.930> like<00:06:08.199> you

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
then placed our adhesive then like you

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.879 
then placed our adhesive then like you
adapt<00:06:08.789> then<00:06:09.789> we<00:06:09.909> did<00:06:10.060> something<00:06:10.419> rather<00:06:10.599> odd<00:06:10.889> I

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
adapt then we did something rather odd I

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.999 
adapt then we did something rather odd I
wanted<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.789> reduce<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.750> stress<00:06:14.530> within<00:06:14.919> the
