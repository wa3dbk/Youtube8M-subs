00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
ha soo really needs to react he has to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.140 
ha soo really needs to react he has to
counter<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.900> fast<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.500> he<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.729> let<00:01:32.939> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
counter as fast as he can not let this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.080 
counter as fast as he can not let this
he<00:01:33.600> cannot<00:01:33.930> let<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.610> economic<00:01:35.610> advantage<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
he cannot let this economic advantage of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
he cannot let this economic advantage of
goody<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.810> too<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.079> longer<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.560> he

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there did he scan or just turret range

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
there did he scan or just turret range
somewhere<00:01:48.000> yeah<00:01:48.270> turret<00:01:48.630> range<00:01:48.840> observer

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
somewhere yeah turret range observer

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
somewhere yeah turret range observer
flew<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.250> close<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> observer

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
flew a little too close to the observer

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
flew a little too close to the observer
get<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> couple<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> shots<00:01:51.570> taken<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.500> look<00:01:53.100> at

get a couple of shots taken but look at
all<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.430> stalkers<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.119> without<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.840> aid

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
all these stalkers here without the aid

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
all these stalkers here without the aid
of<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.350> immortal<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.770> those<00:01:55.920> zealots<00:01:56.159> i'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of that immortal in those zealots i'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.440 
of that immortal in those zealots i'm
not<00:01:56.700> sure<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.939> they're<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.270> able<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
not sure if they're going to be able to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850 
not sure if they're going to be able to
kill<00:01:57.630> off<00:01:57.780> everything<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
kill off everything that they want to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
kill off everything that they want to
there's<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.759> only<00:01:59.790> three<00:02:00.030> tanks<00:02:00.630> left

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
there's actually only three tanks left

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.289 
there's actually only three tanks left
so<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> couple<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> key<00:02:01.770> blinks<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:03.090> could

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so a couple of key blinks actually could

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.679 
so a couple of key blinks actually could
do<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> job<00:02:04.110> we'll<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.299> 12<00:02:06.299> stalkers

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
do the job we'll have to see 12 stalkers

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
do the job we'll have to see 12 stalkers
is<00:02:06.840> nothing<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> sneeze<00:02:07.439> at<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.129> some

is nothing to sneeze at there are some

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.589 
is nothing to sneeze at there are some
destructible<00:02:08.789> rocks<00:02:08.849> Sri<00:02:09.149> brings<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
destructible rocks Sri brings over the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.880 
destructible rocks Sri brings over the
observers<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.110> they<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.379> queue<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.619> some

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
observers so they can queue up some

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.180 
destructible rocks here toward the third
looking<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.270> go<00:02:43.420> toward<00:02:43.690> an<00:02:43.900> even<00:02:44.620> later<00:02:44.830> game

you Adam deserve actually if he did have
an<00:04:07.090> observer<00:04:07.390> there<00:04:07.600> he<00:04:07.750> could<00:04:07.870> blink<00:04:08.050> right

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
an observer there he could blink right

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.600 
an observer there he could blink right
up<00:04:08.440> there<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.770> start<00:04:09.100> killing<00:04:09.370> some

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
up there and start killing some

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.980 
up there and start killing some

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
bunker line our way down here actually

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.910 
bunker line our way down here actually
goodies<00:04:13.570> entire<00:04:13.930> army<00:04:14.350> his<00:04:14.440> way<00:04:14.590> over<00:04:14.770> there

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
goodies entire army his way over there

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.560 
goodies entire army his way over there
here<00:04:15.310> comes<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.610> observer<00:04:15.940> so<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.239> actually

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
here comes the observer so I actually

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.840 
here comes the observer so I actually
hope<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.080> ha<00:04:17.230> soo<00:04:17.440> has<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.770> patience<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.370> get

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
hope that ha soo has the patience to get

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.849 
hope that ha soo has the patience to get
that<00:04:19.030> observer<00:04:19.359> over<00:04:19.720> there<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.080> blink<00:04:20.709> up

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
that observer over there and blink up

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.050 
that observer over there and blink up
the<00:04:21.010> cliff<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.459> would<00:04:21.549> actually<00:04:21.640> be<00:04:21.820> pretty

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
the cliff that would actually be pretty

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.700 
the cliff that would actually be pretty
cool<00:04:22.480> good<00:04:22.840> he<00:04:22.930> actually<00:04:23.110> might<00:04:23.380> even<00:04:23.560> turn

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
cool good he actually might even turn

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.210 
cool good he actually might even turn
into<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.980> base<00:04:24.310> trade<00:04:24.790> in<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.090> scenario

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
into a base trade in that scenario

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.650 
into a base trade in that scenario
however<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.490> looks<00:04:27.580> like<00:04:27.790> goody<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.180> pushing

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
however it looks like goody is pushing
