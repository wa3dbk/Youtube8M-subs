00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello no very important topic 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.960
 of organic chemistry hydrocarbons i 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.820
 dispensers are important because often 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 are considered as the first argument 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 as they then represent the bases 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.759
 to understand other chemistry topics 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 organic materials for testing and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.960
 for athens descriptions on the subject ti 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 methods of an inscription under the wood 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 Let's start right away what are the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 hydrocarbons licor who will have to walls are 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 of organic compounds because they are i 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 organic compounds because they are made up 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 from carbon only from carbon hydrogen 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.810
 therefore only these two elements 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 chemicals 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.460
 the characteristic of hydrocarbons is that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.950
 the carbon atoms are bound i 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.719
 to each other by forming structures 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 which can be more or less long and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 more or less branched so they can 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 have many branched hydrocarbons 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 very long or I was a little carbide 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.039
 the long branched little thing 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 important that in the hydrocarbons the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 carbonia binds precisely together with 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 hydrogen and ethnic bubble articulate 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.680
 so today some quite complex 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.449
 cases 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.980
 let's see now how they are classified 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 the hydrocarbons niro carbons are 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.409
 classified into two large groups that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 are the years ago tc and the aromatics i 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.700
 years fatigue then they come 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 divided into the cyclic acyclic 20 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 aromatics are divided at the single level 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.180
 and aliphatic with a condensed ring 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 acyclic split in their turn 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.580
 marchini to the dog artini the cyclics in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.570
 five floors and cyclamens 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.960
 so this is the characteristic 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.510
 general then we will see in singles and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.460
 precisely dino for which I send separated 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.130
 this is an introductory video then 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.050
 hydrocarbons are very important 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.810
 remember that aromatic hydrocarbons 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 they are the benzene of its derivatives 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.840
 so it was fundamental this is precisely 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.780
 because very important in the others eo 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 carbide chain of a canosa can be 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.090
 then opened the 1000 acritici 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.970
 therefore aliphatic we will have precisely the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.729
 open chain of ac dc and that 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.550
 closed and therefore i was kabul i cyclic 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.290
 therefore the aromatics are ring-shaped 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.600
 I can therefore be the single ring 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.330
 condensed ring and redone can 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.890
 have a cycle or not while you 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.440
 aromatics always have this ring 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.600
 in the single least compensated i 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.550
 aliphatics therefore have in the case of 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.560
 cyclic a ring for gen 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.990
 it is not have one in one structure 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.900
 practically open 20 can also be 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.730
 closed in the street the thing learns from 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.650
 remember that in hydrocarbons we have 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 only proxy mica good coals a 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.160
 carbon hydrogen so there are no types 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.350
 other types as we said of 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.990
 alimony 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.050
 edit last cd carbon carbon bonds 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.410
 they are either polar meu and the sounds are 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.000
 covalent because this is because between 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.070
 hydrogen carbon 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.190
 there is a minimal difference in electro 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.440
 negativity that you learn to circulate about 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.170
 0.4 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.480
 the carbon bond is instead only in 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.350
 minimum is precisely a small part 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.540
 polarized I try for this little one 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.040
 direct difference then negativity 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.630
 there is not one among coal coal 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 tendency to paralyze because not 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.770
 itself and the negativity between coals e 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.780
 hydrogen we will find this type again 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.370
 of relationship that is a very low bed 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.260
 negativity and therefore a little bond 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 polarized so the important thing 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.190
 remember cork that some are these 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.890
 hydrocarbons are and composers 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.450
 formed only by the hydrogen carbons 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.820
 carbon binds but carbon 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.070
 forming line we love popular polar for 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.870
 nothing polarized and idroid carbon 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.960
 born galassi me form a bond with 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.880
 just not so polarized, because 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.830
 the difference between activity between coals 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.870
 hydrogen is minimal so these are the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.970
 characteristics from main note from 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.300
 then remember in the following videos 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.430
 in fact we will see the various hydrocarbons 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.810
 These are important things at 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.400
 so it's also all for this video 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.130
 as always followed you liked 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 put me like i will do tv and on this one 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.270
 topic then sign up to receive 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.880
 immediately updates 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.320
 and watch a fee because all the catches 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.490
 with all the arguments waiting today 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.490
 next video hello soon
