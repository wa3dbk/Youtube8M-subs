00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.240 
development
I<00:00:13.080> was<00:00:13.620> pretty<00:00:14.040> spoiled<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.110> I<00:00:16.410> was

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I was pretty spoiled in that I was

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.950 
I was pretty spoiled in that I was
allowed<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> program<00:00:18.120> that<00:00:18.360> at<00:00:18.630> UVA

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
allowed to be in a program that at UVA

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240 
allowed to be in a program that at UVA
where<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.530> didn't<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> any<00:00:19.980> area

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
where we didn't have any area

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.280 
where we didn't have any area
requirements<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> spent<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.110> two

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
requirements so I spent the first two

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.990 
requirements so I spent the first two
years<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.950> knocking<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> economics

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
years really knocking out the economics

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630 
years really knocking out the economics
and<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.780> allowed<00:00:24.990> me<00:00:25.020> to<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:26.100> explore

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and that allowed me to really explore

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
and that allowed me to really explore
and<00:00:27.030> move<00:00:27.180> into<00:00:28.080> much<00:00:28.230> more<00:00:28.440> of<00:00:28.500> an

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and move into much more of an

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
and move into much more of an
interdisciplinary<00:00:29.510> academic<00:00:30.510> approach<00:00:30.960> more

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
interdisciplinary academic approach more

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.749 
interdisciplinary academic approach more
so<00:00:31.740> than<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:31.920> think<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.160> people<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.550> able<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so than I think most people are able to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
so than I think most people are able to
do<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.149> didn't<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.450> any<00:00:33.600> area<00:00:33.989> requirement

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
do we didn't have any area requirement

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.669 
do we didn't have any area requirement
so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.090> came<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.510> able<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.780> take<00:00:36.989> graduate

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
so I came in was able to take graduate

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.439 
so I came in was able to take graduate
classes<00:00:37.859> pretty<00:00:38.160> quickly<00:00:38.519> and<00:00:38.879> working<00:00:39.179> in

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
classes pretty quickly and working in

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.250 
classes pretty quickly and working in
labs<00:00:39.749> in<00:00:40.230> psychology<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:43.109> whatever

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
labs in psychology and and for whatever

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
labs in psychology and and for whatever
reason<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.879> contrast<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.839> economics

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
reason the this contrast of economics

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.520 
reason the this contrast of economics
and<00:00:46.499> psychology<00:00:47.210> really<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.289> kind

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and psychology really was this this kind

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
and psychology really was this this kind
of<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.679> an<00:00:50.579> annoying<00:00:50.999> but<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.659> had<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.079> many

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
of a an annoying but they had so many

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
of a an annoying but they had so many
assumptions<00:00:52.679> about<00:00:53.089> people<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.179> behavior

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
assumptions about people and behavior

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.809 
assumptions about people and behavior
and<00:00:54.839> how<00:00:55.379> things<00:00:55.589> work<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.249> in<00:00:56.339> contrast

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
and how things work that are in contrast

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.369 
and how things work that are in contrast
that<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> drove<00:00:57.390> me<00:00:57.510> nuts<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.899> years<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that it drove me nuts for years and so I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
that it drove me nuts for years and so I
kind<00:00:58.589> of<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.859> lot<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.429> ways<00:01:00.289> there's<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:02.210> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
kind of a lot of ways there's this that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.540 
kind of a lot of ways there's this that
has<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> come<00:01:04.890> through<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
has actually kind of come through with

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.110 
has actually kind of come through with
me<00:01:05.760> throughout<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:07.580> all<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.850> jobs

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
me throughout all of my all my jobs

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.350 
me throughout all of my all my jobs
since<00:01:09.509> I<00:01:09.930> spent<00:01:10.409> time<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.850> business

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
since I spent time in in business

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
since I spent time in in business
thinking<00:01:13.020> about<00:01:13.200> how<00:01:13.469> poorly<00:01:14.159> understood

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
thinking about how poorly understood

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.389 
thinking about how poorly understood
people<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.719> spend<00:01:16.140> time<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:17.159> bit<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
people are I spend time a little bit now

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.200 
people are I spend time a little bit now
and<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.299> creative<00:01:18.840> world<00:01:19.700> where<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.850> isn't

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and in creative world where there isn't

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.209 
and in creative world where there isn't
a<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:22.079> sharp<00:01:22.439> understanding<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> how

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
a really sharp understanding of how

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.730 
a really sharp understanding of how
market<00:01:24.180> mechanisms<00:01:24.780> work<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.590> why

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
market mechanisms work and why

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
market mechanisms work and why
businesses<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.570> strange<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> way

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
businesses are sort of strange in a way

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
businesses are sort of strange in a way
that<00:01:28.439> people<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:29.390> organizations<00:01:30.390> are

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that people are two organizations are

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
that people are two organizations are
made<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.750> people<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:32.219> have<00:01:32.369> their<00:01:32.640> own

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
made of people and they have their own

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.340 
made of people and they have their own
kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> strange<00:01:33.920> psychology<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.789> so<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
kind of strange psychology and so I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
kind of strange psychology and so I
think<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:38.009> early<00:01:38.250> experience<00:01:38.399> in<00:01:38.670> academics

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
think that early experience in academics

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
think that early experience in academics
really<00:01:39.859> prepared<00:01:40.859> me<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:42.350> studying<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.920> my

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really prepared me for studying in my

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.389 
really prepared me for studying in my
later<00:01:44.460> career<00:01:45.020> across<00:01:46.020> functional<00:01:46.649> areas<00:01:47.039> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
later career across functional areas and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.859 
later career across functional areas and
so<00:01:47.520> I've<00:01:47.789> been<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.149> more<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.359> a<00:01:48.450> generalist

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so I've been much more of a generalist

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.700 
so I've been much more of a generalist
and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.289> been<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:50.399> specialist<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> maybe

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and I have been a specialist and I maybe

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399 
and I have been a specialist and I maybe
I<00:01:52.829> taught<00:01:53.009> me<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> value<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.229> well

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I taught me the value of it and as well

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.620 
I taught me the value of it and as well
it<00:01:56.189> gave<00:01:56.340> me<00:01:56.490> something<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> always<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it gave me something to always kind of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
it gave me something to always kind of
be<00:01:57.740> struggling<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.369> terms<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
be struggling with in terms of like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
be struggling with in terms of like
reconciling<00:02:00.509> things<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:02.060> letting

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
reconciling things and it's that letting

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
reconciling things and it's that letting
your<00:02:03.179> subconscious<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.020> reconcile

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
your subconscious kind of reconcile

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.870 
your subconscious kind of reconcile
things<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.979> being<00:02:05.130> able<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> live<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> sleep

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
things and being able to live and sleep

differently<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.480> that's<00:02:36.599> kind<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> a

differently and I think that's kind of a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
neat future as you know reconciling all

neat future as you know reconciling all
these<00:02:39.959> things<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.290> seem<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.739> at<00:02:41.310> the

these things that seem kind of at the
