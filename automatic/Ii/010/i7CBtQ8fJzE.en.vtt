is making contact I do enjoy what what's

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
is making contact I do enjoy what what's
going<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.789> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
going on right here you know and this is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.380 
going on right here you know and this is
a<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.689> second<00:00:31.410> layer<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.189> always<00:00:33.090> put

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
a kind of second layer and I always put

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.139 
a kind of second layer and I always put
put<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.680> thick<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:36.620> because

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
put it very thick on it because

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.760 
put it very thick on it because
otherwise<00:00:39.149> those<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.050> layers<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.530> mingle

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
otherwise those two layers will mingle

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
otherwise those two layers will mingle
and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> for

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and then it's not really on it and for

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560 
and then it's not really on it and for
example<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.309> tree<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
example when you have a tree that's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
example when you have a tree that's
standing<00:00:46.110> before<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.890> sky<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.340> not

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
standing before the sky they do not

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.139 
standing before the sky they do not
mingle<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.210> well<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:49.590> moving<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:51.000> bit

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
mingle as well just moving a little bit

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.830 
mingle as well just moving a little bit
more<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> does<00:00:55.730> mingle<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
more and see what it does mingle it the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.979 
more and see what it does mingle it the
white<00:00:58.520> sea<00:00:59.520> with<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.539> colors<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> see

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
white sea with the other colors and see

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.980 
white sea with the other colors and see
what<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.909> example<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
what this is for example you see and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.910 
what this is for example you see and
that's<00:01:10.140> coming<00:01:10.830> more<00:01:11.040> depth<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
that's coming more depth into it it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
that's coming more depth into it it
always<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.840> hand<00:01:16.110> put<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
always on this side on right hand put it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
always on this side on right hand put it
on<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.860> side<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:18.110> move<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> over<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> over

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
on this side so I move it over the over

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.429 
on this side so I move it over the over
the<00:01:21.960> canvas

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the canvas

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
the canvas
and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.950> always<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> angle

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and I always start in a kind of angle

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.780 
and I always start in a kind of angle
and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:26.390> reduce<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.869> angle<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.439> why<00:01:28.790> I'm

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and I reduce the angle so why I'm

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
and I reduce the angle so why I'm
starting<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:31.170> paint<00:01:31.500> under

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
starting because the there's paint under

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
starting because the there's paint under
it<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.420> flat<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:34.259> flat

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it and then I go more flat more flat

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.550 
it and then I go more flat more flat
more<00:01:35.400> flat<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.350 

I<00:01:38.649> use<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> lot<00:01:39.579> of<00:01:39.610> paint<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.180> put<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.960> on<00:01:41.140> just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I use a lot of paint to put it on just

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.120 
I use a lot of paint to put it on just
try<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:46.950> see

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
try it you see

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.219 
try it you see
that's<00:01:48.460> making<00:01:49.000> its<00:01:49.479> making<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.049> more

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
that's making its making it more

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's making its making it more

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.960 

this<00:02:35.620> drawing<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.849> always<00:02:38.430> brings<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
this drawing that it always brings the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.670 
this drawing that it always brings the
stuff<00:02:40.480> together<00:02:40.660> let's<00:02:41.319> see<00:02:41.470> what's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
stuff together let's see what's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.530 
stuff together let's see what's
happening<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.989> know<00:02:44.820> give<00:02:45.820> some<00:02:46.060> rest<00:02:46.269> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
happening you know give some rest and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.370 
happening you know give some rest and
maybe<00:02:46.600> here

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
maybe here

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.509 
maybe here
you<00:02:47.650> know<00:02:48.120> maybe<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.019> that's<00:02:50.350> better<00:02:51.190> now

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
you know maybe here so that's better now

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.559 
you know maybe here so that's better now
there's<00:02:52.450> some<00:02:52.720> rest<00:02:53.019> into<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.620> so

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
there's some rest into it so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.050
