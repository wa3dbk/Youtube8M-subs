00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello to all these beautiful organ and 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.129
 welcome to this first collection 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.139
 of graphic mode for skyrim 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.880
 this show will be dedicated to 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.380
 as episodes to my little moves 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.240
 of graphic heart grouped in form 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.020
 collections and its modes will have for 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.700
 goal to increase 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.279
 the immersion of the game and the quality 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.899
 general graph of skyrim 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.360
 so in this first episode we're going 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.059
 talk about three modes namely moss rock 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.770
 ultimate is the egg overall and footprints 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.180
 then to all lord all honor we go 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.559
 start with our stroock since it has 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.090
 been developed by this port to the prince 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.500
 one of the best graphic engines 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.559
 for skyrim since he did between 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.149
 other lush thigh and their graces 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.100
 better than anemic snow and especially water 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.379
 the best graphic mode for 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.899
 improve skyrim lot and in that 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.699
 regards moss rock this mode will add 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.929
 a small layer of foam especially the 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.850
 lowland and medium rocks 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.190
 skyrim mountain to give them 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.739
 really a country feeling and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.019
 forest so this little texture 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.280
 is actually akin to the snow that went 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.569
 drop on the high rocks 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.039
 mountain but except that this is the 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.229
 foam and I find that it reinforces 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.390
 really enormously the immersion of the game 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.280
 at the level of our walks in these forests 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 there since it will give them a small 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 passive a story we will see really 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.040
 the feeling that it's the climate that has 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.250
 grow this moss here on these 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.570
 rocks that are centenarians 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.890
 so here I think it's really 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.180
 a tiny detail this little 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.130
 textures but it really pays 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.320
 a lot to the story of the game and to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.120
 immersion and we go directly to 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.740
 second mode which is ultimate is the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.850
 deer since it will also improve 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.980
 drastically 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.310
 the atmosphere is immersion in 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.470
 skyrim forests since this mode is going 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.150
 enormously densify the branches of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.350
 trees see here it's a lot more 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.900
 bushy is much denser at the level 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.400
 conifers if I do not know if you 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.320
 have in mind the appearance of trees in 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.110
 skyrim vanilla but they are really 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.850
 very very rickety there is very very little 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.380
 of branches we see everything through the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.300
 science walk between these trees we have 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.340
 really the feeling of being in a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.280
 pine and fir forest that we can 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 find our good French forests 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.550
 so this match know it's 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.800
 compatible with woerth flora overall 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.200
 so there is a version of the mode that can 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.960
 be compatible with the famous fashion that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.020
 will replace all the textures 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.010
 trees not only their trunk but 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 also their branch 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.750
 on the other hand know also that this mode will 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.660
 to plumb a little bit your fps so 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.600
 the order of 5.5 fps on average 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 will depend on your configuration 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.550
 so if you have enabled the shadows for 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.680
 the trees via the skyrim file brief this 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.240
 point there I advise you to the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.660
 disable if you want to regained a little 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.890
 fps but in any case I think the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.230
 meaning is well worth the effort 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.830
 since it really increases in a way 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.930
 important 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.970
 immersion and sensations that one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.620
 can have in the forests that combined 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.140
 with big up with it's really 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.240
 excellent and we will immediately net 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.920
 in the mountains for you to show you the 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.640
 last mode so I kept the best 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.100
 for the end 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.110
 to know footprints and as you can 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.600
 you doubt it thanks to the name of this mode 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.950
 this one will add our footprints 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
 not in the snow 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.510
 so ours ours npc those of our 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.110
 companions but also those of all 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.190
 animals monsters to know in that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.740
 the bears the rabbits the hinds the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.510
 foxes so it goes enormously amplified 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.460
 the immersion of the game the sensation that one 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.890
 really walk in snow snow 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420
 for once and if you want my opinion 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.430
 should have been present in the game of 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.120
 but what is it 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.580
 had to think 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.050
 bethesda on this one there finally it takes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.570
 as usual, so expect a modder 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.080
 do the job of the developers and the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.240
 result is etc the way sent 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.700
 graphic we have a little smoke that leaves 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.210
 of our not there the snow actually that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.100
 raises under our noses to know that the 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.740
 mode is in version 0 99 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.740
 version 1.0 of the mode will add the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.530
 compatibility with the mcm so the mode 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.030
 menu configuration of this pebble and one 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.400
 can configure the number of steps that 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.440
 we want to display to know also that this 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 mode has just been compatible with skyrim 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.480
 dragon bound so the last dlc which 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.640
 takes us into morrowind so plans 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.930
 snowy of this mode there of those of this 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.520
 dlc the part of which will be compatible with 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.290
 footprints so the ring will go five 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.840
 prices will be a price will print in the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.700
 snow and know that dragon's den born 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.790
 also offers 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.900
 expanses full of ashes so the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.210
 mode is still not compatible with 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.560
 footprints in the ash but that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.870
 is coming soon in the next update 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.730
 day in the ashes and in the mud where 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.140
 it may be very interesting to 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.140
 know that modder also wants to do 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.670
 so that we can make traces 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.790
 of blood so when we walk in the 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.800
 puddles of blood that could be done 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.200
 also footprints but with 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.940
 blood this time so here it will be by 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.960
 against maybe a little more difficult 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.040
 for him he announces that there will be 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.170
 maybe technical limitations 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.540
 but in any case in the state 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.680
 it's absolutely great it allows us 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.170
 really go to grow 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.520
 not and this case not misguided to come back on 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.290
 our steps to avoid getting lost 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.990
 we can also trace 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.870
 any animal any mpc 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.460
 therefore also improve immersion in 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.710
 skyrim with so little detail it's 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.170
 really very very strong hat to him 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.420
 was done by jon w 17 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.620
 and here it is my little robot for the 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.880
 blow it's been a while since his mast 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.220
 of a development but then he really 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.380
 reached an incredible maturity since 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.300
 the textures match very well with 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.400
 the ground they are beautiful in high 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.410
 resolution is it's great art 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.890
 that's all for this collection 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.350
 fashion 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.230
 if you liked the format or the 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.370
 content of these modes tell me in 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.750
 the comments of this video I 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.120
 prefer to make a slightly longer format 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.110
 like that with some fashions so that 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.760
 lasts longer I can show you 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.310
 more things to look at it we can 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.890
 see in detail everything that has the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.630
 more bushy trees the footprints 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.250
 in the snow 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.840
 and here tell me what you think 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.820
 I prefer doing this rather than 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.950
 little videos 30 seconds on on a 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.690
 little graphic mode and then if you 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.820
 did you like to see the rest of 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.290
 his collections subscribe to my channel 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.330
 and then I'll find you 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.070
 in an upcoming video and by then I 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.970
 See you soon and be well 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.970
 the friends chaired at all
