00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
to be and as soon as it's through it
sees<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> next<00:01:14.219> bend<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.579> as<00:01:14.670> soon<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.939> into<00:01:15.149> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
sees a next bend and as soon as into the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
sees a next bend and as soon as into the
next<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.540> again<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.469> looking<00:01:16.740> through<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
next one again is looking through it and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.910 
next one again is looking through it and
looking<00:01:17.729> where<00:01:17.939> he<00:01:17.969> wants<00:01:18.329> to<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.799> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
looking where he wants to be so here we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
looking where he wants to be so here we
have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.310> left-hand<00:01:20.759> Bend<00:01:20.969> right<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have a left-hand Bend right so we get to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
have a left-hand Bend right so we get to
this<00:01:22.110> point<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.560> by<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.579> we<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.880> here

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this point so by the time we get here

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
this point so by the time we get here
and<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.049> band<00:01:25.229> we've

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and we're going into the band we've

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020 
and we're going into the band we've
already<00:01:25.680> lost<00:01:26.130> our<00:01:26.369> speed<00:01:26.640> we've<00:01:26.759> adjusted

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
already lost our speed we've adjusted

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
already lost our speed we've adjusted
our<00:01:27.329> speed<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.110> speed<00:01:28.469> we're

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
our speed we're at the right speed we're

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.529 
our speed we're at the right speed we're
in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> right<00:01:29.219> gear<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> we've<00:01:30.359> also

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
in the right gear and we've also

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.569 
in the right gear and we've also
completed<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.439> our<00:01:31.680> braking<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.219> don't<00:01:32.430> want

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
completed all our braking we don't want

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.740 
completed all our braking we don't want
to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.700> breaking<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.240> bend<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.630> get

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to be breaking in the bend when we get

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
to be breaking in the bend when we get
to<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.960> point<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.039> be<00:01:35.130> worrying

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to this point all we want to be worrying

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
to this point all we want to be worrying
about<00:01:35.399> is<00:01:35.820> where<00:01:36.180> we're<00:01:36.359> going<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.899> where<00:01:37.049> are

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
about is where we're going so where are

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
about is where we're going so where are
we<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.799> we'll<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
we going well we'll go where we look so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.459 
we going well we'll go where we look so
where<00:01:39.149> should<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> look<00:01:39.450> straight<00:01:40.259> ahead

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
where should we look straight ahead

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.499 
where should we look straight ahead
there's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> wall<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> road<00:01:41.729> sign<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.240> that's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
there's a wall and a road sign if that's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.270 
there's a wall and a road sign if that's
where<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> look<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.680> where<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.130> end

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
where you look that's where you will end

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
where you look that's where you will end
up<00:01:44.429> believe<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.479> try<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> does

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
up believe me don't try it but it does

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
up believe me don't try it but it does
work<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> tell<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.340> experience<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
work I can tell you from experience so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.940 
work I can tell you from experience so
we<00:01:48.570> look<00:01:48.719> around<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.229> bend<00:01:49.469> we<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.920> here

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
we look around the bend we look up here

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.279 
we look around the bend we look up here
across<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> way<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.390> look<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.659> our<00:01:51.689> exit<00:01:52.200> we

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
across this way we look to our exit we

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.139 
across this way we look to our exit we
look<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> where<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.030> look

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
look to where we want to be as we look

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.520 
look to where we want to be as we look
up<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.479> obviously<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.170> see<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.380> there's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
up there obviously we can see if there's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
up there obviously we can see if there's
any<00:01:55.649> other<00:01:55.799> bends<00:01:56.100> approaching<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.820> there's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
any other bends approaching if there's

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
any other bends approaching if there's
any<00:01:57.060> oncoming<00:01:57.509> traffic<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.079> any<00:01:58.229> other

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
any oncoming traffic or any other

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
any oncoming traffic or any other
hazards<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.490> we're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> need<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> make

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
hazards that we're going to need to make

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
hazards that we're going to need to make
allowances<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.499> we<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.950> point

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
allowances for so we get to this point

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
allowances for so we get to this point
we<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.609> through<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> bend<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.869> that's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
we look through the bend and if that's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
we look through the bend and if that's
where<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> look<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.549> where<00:02:05.789> we'll

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
where we look then that is where we'll

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.149 
where we look then that is where we'll
go
