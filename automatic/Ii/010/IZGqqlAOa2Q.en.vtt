00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
absolutely right right it's an

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.690 
absolutely right right it's an
evolutionary<00:02:53.530> thing<00:02:53.800> i<00:02:53.890> think<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700

second nature that women are attracted
to<00:02:56.320> manly<00:02:56.620> men<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.790> feminine<00:02:58.000> but

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to manly men is a little feminine but

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.600 
to manly men is a little feminine but
