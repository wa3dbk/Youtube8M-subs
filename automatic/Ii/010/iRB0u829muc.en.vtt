the<00:00:48.550> cones<00:00:48.790> are<00:00:49.000> rather<00:00:49.180> large<00:00:51.450> they're

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
the cones are rather large they're

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.660 
the cones are rather large they're
heavily<00:00:52.750> armed<00:00:53.320> very<00:00:53.620> painful<00:00:54.190> if<00:00:54.310> you<00:00:54.430> grab

them<00:00:54.970> typically<00:00:55.540> fists<00:00:55.960> shaped<00:00:56.290> or<00:00:56.530> slightly

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
them typically fists shaped or slightly

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.100 
them typically fists shaped or slightly
smaller<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.580> when<00:00:58.090> they<00:00:58.240> fall<00:00:58.420> off<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.840> tree

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
smaller and when they fall off the tree

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.440 
smaller and when they fall off the tree
they<00:00:59.380> leave<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.770> basal<00:01:00.160> scales<00:01:00.490> of<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.850> cone

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
they leave the basal scales of the cone

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.360 
they leave the basal scales of the cone
behind<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.620> when<00:01:02.740> you<00:01:02.800> look<00:01:02.950> at<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.160> cone<00:01:03.340> on

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
behind so when you look at the cone on

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.490 
behind so when you look at the cone on
the<00:01:03.640> ground<00:01:03.910> it's<00:01:04.089> missing<00:01:04.420> those<00:01:04.600> scales<00:01:04.930> or

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the ground it's missing those scales or

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.840 
the ground it's missing those scales or
if<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.740> look<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:06.009> at<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.189> tree<00:01:06.460> you'll<00:01:06.640> see

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
if you look up at the tree you'll see

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.240 
if you look up at the tree you'll see
those<00:01:07.030> basal<00:01:07.509> scales<00:01:07.810> everything<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:09.040> this

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
those basal scales everything about this

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.209

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
quite thick this is a very fire

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.899 
quite thick this is a very fire
resistant<00:01:38.499> tree<00:01:38.710> because<00:01:39.069> of<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.310> thick<00:01:39.549> bark

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
resistant tree because of the thick bark

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.359

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
and without fire it actually has trouble

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.249 
and without fire it actually has trouble
regenerating<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.569> fire<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:43.929> really
