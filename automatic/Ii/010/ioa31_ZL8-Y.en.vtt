white side facing up facing up and what
you'll<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.370> fold<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.510> piece<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.399> thirds

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
you'll do is fold your piece in thirds

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.139 
you'll do is fold your piece in thirds
like<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.170> then<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.829> fold<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.120> half

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
like so then you want to fold it in half

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.270 
like so then you want to fold it in half
just<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> create<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> crease<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:58.219> open<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just to create a crease and then open it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.260 
just to create a crease and then open it
right<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:01.579> then<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
right back up and then you're going to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
right back up and then you're going to
fold<00:01:03.739> over<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.369> folding<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.939> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
fold over and you're folding it in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
fold over and you're folding it in
thirds<00:01:06.299> again<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> may<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
thirds again so you know you may have to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.420 
thirds again so you know you may have to
measure<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:10.020> us<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.070> getting<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
measure to see us that you're getting it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020 
measure to see us that you're getting it
right<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.820> fold<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:14.030> your

side and folding that over so that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.979 
side and folding that over so that
you've<00:02:50.269> created<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:51.400> point<00:02:53.739> like<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.630> again

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
you've created a point like so so again

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.370 
you've created a point like so so again
on<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.769> bottom<00:02:58.190> corner<00:02:59.000> then<00:02:59.390> you're<00:02:59.989> doing

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
on the bottom corner then you're doing

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.120 
on the bottom corner then you're doing
an<00:03:00.880> inside<00:03:01.880> reverse<00:03:02.390> fold<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.380> again<00:03:03.709> that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
an inside reverse fold so again that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.030 
an inside reverse fold so again that
means<00:03:04.400> you're<00:03:04.670> just<00:03:04.850> sort<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> folding<00:03:06.040> that

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
means you're just sort of folding that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.479 
means you're just sort of folding that
corner<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.530> reversing<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.680> inside<00:03:12.489> like

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
corner in and reversing it inside like

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.900 
corner in and reversing it inside like
that<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.060> folding<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.870> down<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:16.610> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that and folding it down and then the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.270 
that and folding it down and then the
very<00:03:17.090> little<00:03:17.810> opposite<00:03:18.410> side<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.800> this<00:03:18.950> flap

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
very little opposite side of this flap

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.320 
very little opposite side of this flap
your<00:03:19.580> you're<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:19.880> going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.060> fold

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
your you're just going to fold

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.880 
your you're just going to fold
underneath<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.500> match<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.620> when<00:03:24.769> you're

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
underneath to match so that when you're

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.360 
underneath to match so that when you're
done<00:03:25.510> you'll<00:03:26.510> have<00:03:26.750> oh<00:03:26.930> you'll<00:03:27.769> have<00:03:27.920> created

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
done you'll have oh you'll have created

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.590 
done you'll have oh you'll have created
a<00:03:28.459> point<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:29.060> each<00:03:29.810> end

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
a point on each end

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.510 
a point on each end
here<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.990> then<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.470> flap<00:03:33.020> on<00:03:34.020> this<00:03:34.980> end<00:03:35.250> is

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
here and then this flap on this end is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.120 
here and then this flap on this end is
folded<00:03:36.090> over<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:42.350> now<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.890> end

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
folded over like so now on this end

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.450 
folded over like so now on this end
where<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.490> just<00:03:44.730> created<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.750> points<00:03:46.460> I'm

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
where you just created the points I'm

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.680 
where you just created the points I'm
going<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.670> hold<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.150> way<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.630> a

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
going to hold it this way so it's a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.060 
going to hold it this way so it's a
little<00:03:48.840> easier<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.650> what<00:03:49.980> I'm

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
little easier for you to see what I'm

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.660 
little easier for you to see what I'm
doing<00:03:50.190> you're<00:03:50.730> going<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:51.930> fold<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.310> edge

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
doing you're going to now fold this edge

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.860 
doing you're going to now fold this edge
and<00:03:54.360> you're<00:03:54.540> going<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.720> fold<00:03:54.920> this<00:03:55.920> backwards

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
and you're going to fold this backwards

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.380 
and you're going to fold this backwards
one<00:03:57.870> more<00:03:58.140> time<00:03:58.410> along<00:03:59.310> sort<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> center

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
one more time along sort of the center

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.160 
one more time along sort of the center
line<00:04:00.660> here<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.680> let's<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.610> like<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:03.170> I'm

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
line here so let's do it like this I'm

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.720 
line here so let's do it like this I'm
going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> fold<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:05.630> fold<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:07.160> backwards<00:04:08.160> and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
going to fold it fold it backwards and

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.690 
going to fold it fold it backwards and
tuck<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.110> now<00:04:13.350> right<00:04:14.190> along<00:04:14.490> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
tuck it in so that now right along the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.990 
tuck it in so that now right along the
center<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.180> where<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:16.400> point<00:04:17.400> was<00:04:17.670> is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
center of where that little point was is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.750 
center of where that little point was is
where<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.570> fold<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.440> I've<00:04:19.530> just<00:04:19.760> tucked

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
where the fold is and I've just tucked

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:31.070 
where the fold is and I've just tucked
it<00:04:20.940> down<00:04:22.160> inside<00:04:26.090> like<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:29.510> now<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.810> then

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it down inside like that now and then

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.840 
it down inside like that now and then
now<00:04:31.290> when<00:04:31.500> you're<00:04:31.620> done<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:31.980> flip<00:04:32.730> it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
now when you're done with that flip it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.880 
now when you're done with that flip it
around<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.050> you're<00:04:34.260> ready<00:04:34.290> for<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.710> next

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
around so that you're ready for the next

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.720 
around so that you're ready for the next
folds<00:04:35.810> all<00:04:36.810> right<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.890> have<00:04:38.160> your<00:04:38.190> piece

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
folds all right so you have your piece

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.540 
folds all right so you have your piece
you've<00:04:38.940> flipped<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.480> over<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.380> last<00:04:40.680> bit

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
you've flipped it over and the last bit

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.130 
you've flipped it over and the last bit
that<00:04:41.580> you're<00:04:41.880> going<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.150> doing<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.540> on<00:04:42.720> this

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
that you're going to be doing is on this

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.680 
that you're going to be doing is on this
edge<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.030> side<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.300> you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
edge this is this is the side that you

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.250 
edge this is this is the side that you
just<00:04:45.900> folded<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:46.770> part<00:04:47.100> over<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:49.080> what

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
just folded that part over and so what

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.750 
just folded that part over and so what
we're<00:04:49.350> going<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.530> be<00:04:49.590> working<00:04:49.770> on<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.490> end

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
we're going to be working on is this end

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.730 
we're going to be working on is this end
and<00:04:51.090> what<00:04:51.480> we're<00:04:51.600> really<00:04:51.750> creating<00:04:52.020> now<00:04:52.470> is

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
and what we're really creating now is

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.490 
and what we're really creating now is
the<00:04:52.980> neck<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.520> bottle<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:55.140> way<00:04:55.290> we're

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
the neck of the bottle and the way we're

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.700 
the neck of the bottle and the way we're
going<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.650> do<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.990> we're<00:04:57.990> folding<00:04:58.230> this

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
going to do that is we're folding this

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.130 
going to do that is we're folding this
again<00:04:59.280> it's<00:04:59.730> another<00:05:00.150> one<00:05:00.420> of<00:05:00.480> these<00:05:00.690> folding

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
again it's another one of these folding

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.780 
again it's another one of these folding
it<00:05:01.290> in<00:05:01.440> thirds<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.700> fold<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.450> first<00:05:03.780> side<00:05:04.260> of

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
it in thirds so fold the first side of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.630 
it in thirds so fold the first side of
this<00:05:05.790> piece<00:05:06.270> over<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.230> you're<00:05:07.640> going

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
this piece over and you're going

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.850 
this piece over and you're going
straight<00:05:09.090> up<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.450> down<00:05:09.510> along<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.410> center

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
straight up and down along the center

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.780 
straight up and down along the center
part<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.620> when<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.980> do<00:05:14.190> that<00:05:14.400> it's<00:05:14.580> going<00:05:14.700> to

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
part and when you do that it's going to

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.900 
part and when you do that it's going to
start<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.150> pull<00:05:15.540> over<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:19.070> kind<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.220> put

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
start to pull over this and kind of put

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.600 
start to pull over this and kind of put
your<00:05:21.120> finger<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.040> can<00:05:23.190> create<00:05:23.370> a

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
your finger in so that you can create a

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.640 
your finger in so that you can create a
bit<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:25.380> fold<00:05:25.710> inside<00:05:26.430> here<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.440> fold<00:05:28.440> it

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
bit of a fold inside here and fold it

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.310 
bit of a fold inside here and fold it
down<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.370> want<00:05:29.670> this<00:05:29.940> angle<00:05:30.690> then<00:05:30.960> on

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
down and you want this angle then on

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.160 
down and you want this angle then on
this<00:05:31.680> part<00:05:31.740> as<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.550> fold<00:05:32.760> it<00:05:32.910> down<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.660> begin
