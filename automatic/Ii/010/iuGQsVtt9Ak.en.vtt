some very cool things happening we're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.799 
some very cool things happening we're
going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> divide<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.030> video<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> few

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
going to divide this video into a few

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.120 
going to divide this video into a few
sort<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> sections<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.710> things<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.039> are

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
sort of sections of things that are

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.290 
sort of sections of things that are
going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.340> happen<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> things<00:00:18.210> I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
going to happen one of the things I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.429 
going to happen one of the things I
think<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> happen<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.170> source

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
think that's going to happen is source

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
think that's going to happen is source
too<00:00:19.800> that's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.400> new<00:00:20.580> engine<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.270> game<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
too that's a new engine for the game and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.050 
too that's a new engine for the game and
other<00:00:21.960> valve<00:00:22.260> games<00:00:22.590> also<00:00:22.980> think<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> spy<00:00:23.670> vs.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
other valve games also think the spy vs.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.490 
other valve games also think the spy vs.

year there's competitive matchmaking

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.419 
year there's competitive matchmaking
which<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.779> almost<00:00:27.960> definitely<00:00:28.650> coming<00:00:29.039> very

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
which is almost definitely coming very

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.220 
which is almost definitely coming very
soon<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.929> game

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
soon I think there's going to be in game

streaming this is sort of already in
steam<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> moment<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.380> i<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.649> expand<00:00:34.950> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
steam at the moment but i will expand on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.440 
steam at the moment but i will expand on
that<00:00:35.130> later<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> also<00:00:35.969> think<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:36.329> going

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that later and also think there's going

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this year you can see this on the steam

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
this year you can see this on the steam
machines<00:00:51.360> page<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> page<00:00:51.960> went<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.559> Steam

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889 
machines page this page went up on Steam
quite<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.789> while<00:00:54.030> ago<00:00:54.059> quite<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> few<00:00:54.660> months<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
quite a while ago quite a few months I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.209 
quite a while ago quite a few months I
think<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> even<00:00:55.289> went<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.500> last<00:00:55.649> year<00:00:55.980> sometime

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
think it even went up last year sometime

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
think it even went up last year sometime
so<00:00:56.670> far<00:00:56.820> they've<00:00:57.000> announced<00:00:57.180> here's<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
so far they've announced here's when the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.119 
so far they've announced here's when the
steam<00:00:58.230> machines<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> lab<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> I'd

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
steam machines are going to lab and I'd

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
steam machines are going to lab and I'd
see<00:00:59.280> no<00:00:59.430> reason<00:00:59.640> why<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.090> date<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.629> change

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
see no reason why this date would change

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
see no reason why this date would change
I<00:01:01.170> mean<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.370> pre<00:01:02.699> existing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I mean they're all just pre existing

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
I mean they're all just pre existing
hardware<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> only<00:01:03.960> new<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.739> these

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
hardware the only new thing in these

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.590 
hardware the only new thing in these
steam<00:01:05.100> machines<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> fact<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.270> running

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
steam machines is the fact that running

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260 
steam machines is the fact that running
steam<00:01:06.869> OS<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.950> steams<00:01:08.340> own<00:01:08.580> operating

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
steam OS that steams own operating

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
steam OS that steams own operating
system<00:01:09.390> steams<00:01:09.960> version<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.409> Windows<00:01:10.830> steams

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
system steams version of Windows steams

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.420 
system steams version of Windows steams
version<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> Makos<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.689> basically<00:01:13.140> just

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
version of Makos it's basically just

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.530 
version of Makos it's basically just
centered<00:01:14.430> around<00:01:14.549> playing<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.150> games<00:01:15.330> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
centered around playing your games on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
centered around playing your games on
steam<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.110> why<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> talking<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.860> steam

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
steam so why are you talking about steam

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
steam so why are you talking about steam
OS<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> steam<00:01:18.000> machines<00:01:18.299> cast<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:18.750> we're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
OS and steam machines cast where we're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
OS and steam machines cast where we're
here<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> talk<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.259> source<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
here to talk about source too well I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
here to talk about source too well I
think<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> makes<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> sense<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:22.020> file

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
think it makes a lot of sense when file

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
think it makes a lot of sense when file
for<00:01:22.380> coming<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> huge<00:01:23.369> software

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
for coming out with this huge software

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
for coming out with this huge software
update<00:01:24.270> steam<00:01:25.080> OS<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.890> another<00:01:26.250> software

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
update steam OS that another software

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.060 
update steam OS that another software
update<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.540> probably<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.500> tied<00:01:28.799> into

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
update is probably going to be tied into

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
makes sense that the engine would come

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319

what<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.360> system<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:45.960> we'll<00:02:46.080> probably

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
what the system I think we'll probably

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
what the system I think we'll probably
try<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.130> ranked<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.420> more

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
try and do is ranked you so the more

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
try and do is ranked you so the more
games<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.050> win<00:02:49.230> or<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> better<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
games you win or the better you do in a

games you win or the better you do in a
particular<00:02:50.550> game<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.060> higher<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.510> rank<00:02:51.750> and

particular game the higher your rank and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.840

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
is definitely coming is great if you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.440 
is definitely coming is great if you
actually<00:03:01.560> watch<00:03:01.890> X<00:03:02.160> televisions<00:03:02.700> video<00:03:03.060> they

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
actually watch X televisions video they

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.240 
actually watch X televisions video they
believe<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> come<00:03:05.130> in

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
believe that this is going to come in

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.160 
believe that this is going to come in
the<00:03:05.310> next<00:03:05.430> couple<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.880> months<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.840> would

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the next couple of months so that would

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.170 
the next couple of months so that would
be<00:03:07.320> awesome<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.340> don't<00:03:08.520> think<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.790> update

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
be awesome and I don't think this update

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.640 
be awesome and I don't think this update
would<00:03:09.300> come<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.750> its<00:03:09.900> own<00:03:10.050> i<00:03:10.080> think<00:03:10.410> there<00:03:10.590> will

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
would come on its own i think there will

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.830 
would come on its own i think there will
be<00:03:10.710> other<00:03:11.130> stuff<00:03:11.490> with<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.150> don't<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
be other stuff with it I don't think the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.540 
be other stuff with it I don't think the
Spy<00:03:13.050> vs<00:03:13.380> engineer<00:03:13.740> update<00:03:13.890> would<00:03:14.190> come<00:03:14.370> with

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
Spy vs engineer update would come with

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.130 
Spy vs engineer update would come with
it<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:14.850> they're<00:03:15.090> not<00:03:15.270> really<00:03:15.600> connected

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it because they're not really connected

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.780 
it because they're not really connected
but<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.320> do<00:03:16.410> think<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.070> there<00:03:17.340> might<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.520> some

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
but I do think that there might be some

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
but I do think that there might be some
cosmetics<00:03:18.450> they'll<00:03:18.810> almost<00:03:19.110> definitely<00:03:20.010> be

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
cosmetics they'll almost definitely be

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.190 
cosmetics they'll almost definitely be
things<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.670> medals<00:03:21.240> or<00:03:21.450> badges<00:03:21.720> to

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
things like medals or badges to

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.440 
things like medals or badges to
represent<00:03:22.740> how<00:03:22.920> you're<00:03:23.400> competitive<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.209> game

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
represent how you're competitive in game

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420 
represent how you're competitive in game
career<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.230> progressing<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.280> that's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
career is progressing I think that's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.350 
career is progressing I think that's
something<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.670> everyone<00:03:27.000> should<00:03:27.209> look

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
something that everyone should look

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.490 
something that everyone should look
forward<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:28.020> people<00:03:28.230> who<00:03:28.290> want<00:03:28.440> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
forward to not just people who want to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.380 
forward to not just people who want to
play<00:03:28.590> competitive<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:30.000> shows

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
play competitive but it really shows

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.930 
play competitive but it really shows
that<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.840> devs<00:03:31.110> care<00:03:31.920> about<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.340> game<00:03:32.580> still

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that the devs care about this game still

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.340 
that the devs care about this game still
and<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:33.270> are<00:03:33.360> still<00:03:33.540> working<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.050> mean<00:03:34.080> this

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and they are still working I mean this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
and they are still working I mean this
is<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.530> huge<00:03:34.950> feature<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.610> guys<00:03:35.790> from<00:03:36.000> X

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is a huge feature and the guys from X

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.490 
is a huge feature and the guys from X
television<00:03:36.660> said<00:03:36.780> when<00:03:36.930> they<00:03:37.020> went<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
television said when they went there a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
television said when they went there a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
lot of this was already built so might

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.000 
lot of this was already built so might
be<00:03:39.810> wondering<00:03:39.990> why<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.290> developers<00:03:40.890> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
be wondering why the developers have

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.740 
be wondering why the developers have
been<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.250> quite<00:03:41.550> recently<00:03:42.000> well<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.540> could

been so quite recently well this could

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.120 
been so quite recently well this could
be<00:03:42.840> part<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.290> moving<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.920> thing

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
be part of it moving on to the thing

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.640 
be part of it moving on to the thing
that<00:03:44.280> excites<00:03:44.430> me<00:03:45.330> personally<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.320> of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.300 
update but quite a lot of things that
I've<00:03:56.970> got<00:03:57.209> Spy<00:03:57.540> vs<00:03:57.959> engineer<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> name<00:03:59.130> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I've got Spy vs engineer in the name and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.640 
I've got Spy vs engineer in the name and
new<00:03:59.670> weapon<00:04:00.150> abilities<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.989> didn't

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
new weapon abilities that didn't

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.070 
new weapon abilities that didn't
previously<00:04:01.920> exist<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.970> same<00:04:03.300> code<00:04:03.660> that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
previously exist in this same code that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.780 
previously exist in this same code that
I<00:04:04.290> showed<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.800> was<00:04:04.950> leaked<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.489> there<00:04:05.640> all

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
I showed that was leaked in there all

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.820 
I showed that was leaked in there all
rather<00:04:06.390> discovered<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> spy<00:04:07.470> vs.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
rather discovered in the spy vs.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.920 
rather discovered in the spy vs.
engineer<00:04:08.250> video<00:04:08.550> was<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.090> matchmaking<00:04:09.600> code

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
engineer video was the matchmaking code

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.330 
engineer video was the matchmaking code
so<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.350> fact<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.830> matchmaking

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
so the fact that this matchmaking

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.580 
so the fact that this matchmaking
service<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.910> coming<00:04:12.209> probably<00:04:12.660> quite<00:04:12.900> soon<00:04:13.170> it

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
service is coming probably quite soon it

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.320 
service is coming probably quite soon it
also<00:04:13.770> implies<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.370> spy<00:04:14.550> vs.<00:04:14.880> engineer

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
also implies that the spy vs. engineer

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.020 
also implies that the spy vs. engineer
update<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:16.350> probably<00:04:16.980> in<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.310> similar<00:04:17.700> stage<00:04:17.880> of

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
update is probably in a similar stage of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.210 
update is probably in a similar stage of
completion<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.780> top<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.350> filed<00:04:19.919> haven't

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
completion on top of that filed haven't

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.890 
completion on top of that filed haven't
done<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> big<00:04:20.580> update<00:04:20.790> like<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.870> long

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
done a big update like this in a long

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.320 
done a big update like this in a long
time<00:04:22.229> it's<00:04:22.919> long<00:04:23.130> over<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.760> yes<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
matchmaking update is going to be a big

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.690 
matchmaking update is going to be a big
update<00:04:25.950> but

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
update but

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.180 
that's going to come in with the batch
making<00:06:34.320> system<00:06:34.710> that<00:06:34.800> we<00:06:34.890> talked<00:06:35.070> about

making system that we talked about
earlier<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:35.850> then<00:06:36.300> obviously<00:06:36.510> it<00:06:36.810> will<00:06:36.870> be

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
earlier and then obviously it will be

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.320 
earlier and then obviously it will be
utilized<00:06:37.500> for<00:06:37.680> things<00:06:37.980> like<00:06:38.070> this<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:39.000> final
