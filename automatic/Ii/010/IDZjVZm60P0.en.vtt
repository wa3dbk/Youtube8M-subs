00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.889
 welcome all fishermen 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 I will review spinning today 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.480
 coils 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 Favorite Rick for and so I reel 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.269
 three thousandth 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.140
 I bought it recently and now I want you 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.500
 tell a little bit about it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.530
 we have a box 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.480
 let's not pull time 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:44.000
 open the box and watch the contents 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 this is a spinless reel so here is a spool 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.870
 goes the coil itself so here we see in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 boxes at the bottom of the pouch 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 farther on the bottom lies here the scheme from which 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:13.979
 parts is this coil that's who 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 interesting look so well let's 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.790
 now go directly to the most 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:27.240
 coil used to be a company favorite 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.150
 did not release spare spools and now 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.329
 began to let out and here we see in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.630
 this coil comes with a spare 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.159
 spool 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.720
 here is our reel so pen we can 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.700
 to insert 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 both under the left side of the coil and under 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 right and left hand and under right 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.430
 let me fix the handle now 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.430
 gear ratio of this coil in 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 5.2 to one 8 ball bearings of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.069
 of stainless steel 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 + 1 roller instant stop 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.759
 reverse 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:26.360
 so secured the move smooth 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.480
 at the coil the course is smooth which cannot but 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.480
 to please 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:42.379
 aluminum spool coated side 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:47.379
 titanium nitride so dotted aluminum 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:51.220
 handle with ergonomic handle 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:56.269
 the weight of the coil is 255 grams 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:01.700
 enough stick what he said it 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:07.280
 spinning reel for predator fishing i 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.970
 she bought to catch pike perch and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.459
 perch 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.109
 it is primarily also caught and 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:21.169
 other predatory fish size spools 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:26.560
 we select under our bait on 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.560
 our spinning and under our future prey 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:39.530
 so this back coil has no backlashes 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:42.160
 I guarantee you there is no reset loops so here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.160
 shackle 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.150
 price from 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.800
 but of course good enough but for 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.800
 quality as they say you need to pay 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.970
 spools can be tightened 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.260
 you can let go 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.640
 when fishing the spool should be a little 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.640
 released so when biting large fish 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.990
 released spool protects us from 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:32.240
 cord break 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:36.420
 so on here such a coated pen with 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.810
 porous coating allowing us three 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:45.230
 wet our hands with wet poland 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.840
 fingers they will not slide on the handle 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:53.760
 here we will be calm 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:57.510
 wiring I really like this 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 the coil test of this coil is mandatory 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.980
 will be on the pond oh soon i'm going 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.280
 go to the predator you look given 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.910
 coil into action so i want you 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.160
 wish good luck on fishing 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:22.630
 good trophies you think 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:24.550
 briefly talked about this coil at least 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.560
 in the comments which coil you 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:34.140

 fishing practice where you can 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.020
 learn more about spinning fishing and 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.410
 general fishing just go to my 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.300
