were younger if I can explain this to
people<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.320> home<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.950> remember<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
people at home a little bit remember the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
people at home a little bit remember the
flyaway<00:00:39.090> footballs<00:00:39.540> were<00:00:39.690> 50<00:00:40.079> P<00:00:40.290> or<00:00:40.350> 99<00:00:40.920> P<00:00:41.160> we

flyaway footballs were 50 P or 99 P we

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.040 
flyaway footballs were 50 P or 99 P we
could<00:00:41.520> afford<00:00:41.790> them<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> slightly

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
could afford them there was a slightly

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
could afford them there was a slightly
more<00:00:43.469> expensive<00:00:43.559> ball<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.820> made<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
more expensive ball that was made a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.770 
more expensive ball that was made a
plastic<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:45.930> cost<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:47.149> $1.99<00:00:48.149> we

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
plastic which cost about $1.99 we

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
plastic which cost about $1.99 we
sometimes<00:00:49.289> treated<00:00:49.649> ourselves<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.309> click

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
sometimes treated ourselves to it click

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
sometimes treated ourselves to it click
it<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.600> may<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.890> know

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it a little bit like that may you know

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
it a little bit like that may you know
what<00:00:53.539> it's<00:00:54.539> basically<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:56.219> giant<00:00:56.879> beach<00:00:57.480> ball

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
what it's basically a giant beach ball

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
what it's basically a giant beach ball
that's<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> an<00:00:58.680> expect<00:00:59.010> $200

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that's what it is it's an expect $200

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189 
that's what it is it's an expect $200
beach<00:00:59.760> ball<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.270> tell<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> why<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.989> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
beach ball and I tell you why it's it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
beach ball and I tell you why it's it's
the<00:01:01.469> process<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> they've<00:01:02.399> used<00:01:02.539> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the process that they've used to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
the process that they've used to
actually<00:01:03.719> thermally<00:01:04.409> bond<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.010> there's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
actually thermally bond it and there's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
actually thermally bond it and there's
only<00:01:05.670> eight<00:01:06.060> panels<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.689> there<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.320> we

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
only eight panels in there when we

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
only eight panels in there when we
played<00:01:07.799> though<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.430> were<00:01:08.520> 32<00:01:09.090> panels<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
played though there were 32 panels and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
played though there were 32 panels and
it<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:09.990> stitched<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.950> therefore<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it was stitched so therefore when you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
it was stitched so therefore when you
kicked<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> had<00:01:12.869> loft<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:13.740> drag<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
kicked it it had loft and it had drag so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
kicked it it had loft and it had drag so
you<00:01:14.760> could<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.240> could<00:01:15.450> swerve<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you could you could swerve it and you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
you could you could swerve it and you
could<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.979> topspin<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.909> side<00:01:18.150> spin<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
could put topspin or side spin and you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
could put topspin or side spin and you
could<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.409> ball<00:01:19.650> right<00:01:20.280> before<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
could work the ball right before you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.380 
could work the ball right before you
could<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.790> used<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> head<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
could well is it I used to head it and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.740 
could well is it I used to head it and
kick<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> saw<00:01:24.930> Santa<00:01:29.090> explain<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
kick it I saw Santa explain it now so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
kick it I saw Santa explain it now so
what's<00:01:30.960> happened<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.530> they've<00:01:32.070> taken<00:01:32.369> away

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what's happened is they've taken away

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
what's happened is they've taken away
all<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> drag<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> ball<00:01:34.320> doesn't<00:01:34.979> swerve

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
all the drag so the ball doesn't swerve

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
all the drag so the ball doesn't swerve
or<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> player<00:01:37.020> asks<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
or or do what the player asks it to do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
or or do what the player asks it to do
it<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.460> keeps<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.090> accelerating<00:01:39.869> through

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it just keeps on accelerating through

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.330 
it just keeps on accelerating through
and<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.500> why<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> seeing<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.189> these

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and that's why you seeing all these

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
and that's why you seeing all these
balls<00:01:41.610> flying<00:01:42.210> over<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> bar<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
