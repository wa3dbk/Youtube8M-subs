for a shopback we hit the post and I
from<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.680> rebound<00:05:42.070> it's<00:05:42.250> her<00:05:42.430> Nana's<00:05:42.849> who

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
from the rebound it's her Nana's who

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.870 
from the rebound it's her Nana's who

makes it 22 any 86 minutes so yeah we

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.700
