00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
video she was using eco styler gel which

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
video she was using eco styler gel which
is<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.170> inexpensive<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> said<00:01:05.670> let<00:01:05.820> me

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is really inexpensive so I said let me

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
is really inexpensive so I said let me
go<00:01:05.939> ahead<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> try<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
go ahead and try it because you know I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
go ahead and try it because you know I
really<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.950> things<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.229> inexpensive

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
really like things that are inexpensive

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899 
really like things that are inexpensive
most<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> things<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.400> use<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.850> my

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
most of the things that i use on my

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
most of the things that i use on my
channel<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.689> inexpensive<00:01:12.990> um<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:15.590> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
channel are very inexpensive um so this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
channel are very inexpensive um so this
is<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.890> experiment<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.520> eco<00:01:17.880> styler<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.630> used

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is my experiment with eco styler I used

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
is my experiment with eco styler I used
the<00:01:19.439> clear<00:01:19.680> eco<00:01:19.979> styler<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.520> opposed<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the clear eco styler as opposed to the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
the clear eco styler as opposed to the
eco<00:01:21.780> styler<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.200> olive<00:01:22.470> oil<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> did

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
eco styler with olive oil and what I did

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.520 
eco styler with olive oil and what I did
was<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.490> mix<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> olive<00:01:24.210> oil<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> clear

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
was I mix the olive oil with the clear

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.820 
was I mix the olive oil with the clear
eco<00:01:25.830> styler<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.820> you'll<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.479> after<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
eco styler which you'll see after this I

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.590 
eco styler which you'll see after this I
show<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> process<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> how<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> mix<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
show the process of how I mix it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
show the process of how I mix it
together<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.259> i<00:01:31.650> show<00:01:31.860> how<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> apply<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> after

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
together and i show how I apply it after

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.719 
together and i show how I apply it after
I<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.659> leaving<00:01:34.470> conditioner<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I put in my leaving conditioner and the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
I put in my leaving conditioner and the
process<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.509> used<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
process that I used to do it and it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
process that I used to do it and it's
pretty<00:01:38.310> similar<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.420> process<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> cause

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
pretty similar to the process that cause

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.819 
pretty similar to the process that cause
curls<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:40.979> kinks<00:01:41.340> use<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.909> um<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
curls and kinks use so um I got the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
curls and kinks use so um I got the
