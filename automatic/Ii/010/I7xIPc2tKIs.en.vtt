00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.750
 is that if it was verified of tenderness and 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.750
 we compare with the house of this the father 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.370
 is the same type of design here we are going to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.540
 open it up point we're going to put this on 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.150
 this side 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.890
 and let's open it's not an ipad mini 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.890
 white 16 gigabytes 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.450
 all 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.580

 soon for sale 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:03:00.450
 and we are going to make a small comparison 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.980
 quickly this is an ipad many me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.120
 have asked what are the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.730
 size differences of an iPad of 9.7 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.120
 perverse inches of 7.9 here can you 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.760
 see if there is a noticeable difference 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 you can check this this 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.450
 comparative if we say that if it's a lot 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.400
 more obviously it is appreciated that it is that 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.140
 it's much smaller, other more 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.420
 the inch and fraction of difference if 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.420
 they are completely notorious 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.420
 and here is 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.159
 but it has 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.159
 here comes the connector with the cable 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.110
 a connector similar to his 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.260
 point 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.990
 in the sense it is not as big as the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.510
 corrector that is included in the live 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.020
 starting from the point really the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:09.510
 operation manuals sending products 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.640
 but hey let's a 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.640
 according to a small test 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.480
 the details 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:23.139
 very well 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.430
 in cocoa 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.860
 in our heart 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.460
 so that you can see much more of 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.460
 this side 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 teaches 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.999
 record the button 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.999
 the microphone 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.530
 he is he 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.520
 good silver let's do let's go to 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.430
 turn it on so you can see what 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.879
 and everything is fine if the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.759
 absence of the retina display screen 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.729
 we can already see are really appreciated 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.190
 like the pixels inside this this 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.400
 picture something that does not happen on iphone 5 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.009
 something that does not happen on the screens of 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.780
 ipad but good to see is part of how 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.220
 these characteristics must be remembered 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.310
 that this product 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.960
 the ipad mini is a product with 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.389
 features less than the iPad of 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.280
 fourth generation is a product much 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.770
 smaller as it happened when 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.560
 there was an ipod after an iphone mini 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.690
 there are no characteristics you can 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.159
 notice however obviously obviously here 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.500
