00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello older souza personal'm here in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 in the second part of the video talking under the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.769
 on the single kick missed the serve and did not 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.769
 saw the first video 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:26.670
 the first movement and aaa the figure that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.290
 I'll use that in these examples of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.489
 today it will be six or 66 in time 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 right 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 in the first class z4 time the thigh now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 let's watch it or six for a while 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.200
 so in this first example I'll do 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.789
 distribution here for you to see how it is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.410
 what can be done and china 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.699
 instead of always staying the whole time 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 banging ask the date we'll go 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.969
 It's supposed to stay a little longer. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.969
 interesting 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.850
 in this second example but it is another 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.950
 form of taxation for you to have at 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.429
 less a base or suddenly 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:31.209
 This gives rise to ten other cases 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:34.400
 explore a third example, I will 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.180
 use two actions one for the third and 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.950
 another for the fourth time inside the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.220
 raised when you are 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.590
 exercise seeking exercise turn 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.500
 always carried with it because I 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.200
 This is what will come next to the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.900
 when they are playing 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.450
 playing what you guys are going to do the turns 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.750
 so I make more turns with high one 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.750
 good tip then exercise would be like this 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.659
 let's go again 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:44.750
 the next example is similar to the 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.790
 previous but less strong 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:04:23.930
 the tones image of the box would then be 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:04:26.990
 so the next exercise I'm going to use the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.310
 also in the orchestration and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.970
 you will see that it gives a very 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.970
 interesting
