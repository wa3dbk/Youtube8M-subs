stone and iron above it so these right
here<00:01:59.440> are<00:01:59.670> display<00:02:00.670> cases<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.540> is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
here are display cases and this is

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.780 
here are display cases and this is
probably<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.590> best<00:02:02.740> part<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> mod<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.610> most

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
probably the best part of mod the most

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.030 
probably the best part of mod the most
interesting<00:02:04.240> part<00:02:04.540> well<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.380> do<00:02:05.710> like<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
interesting part well I do like the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.339 
interesting part well I do like the
potion<00:02:06.400> rack<00:02:06.550> over<00:02:06.970> there<00:02:07.150> but<00:02:07.480> anyway<00:02:07.720> the

potion rack over there but anyway the
display<00:02:08.679> case<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.160> pretty<00:02:09.489> cool<00:02:09.729> because<00:02:10.710> you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
display case is pretty cool because you

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.440 
display case is pretty cool because you
can<00:02:11.860> display<00:02:12.160> any<00:02:12.220> items<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.850> want<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.240> so

you<00:04:04.169> want<00:04:04.470> them<00:04:04.590> some<00:04:05.459> ways<00:04:05.609> look<00:04:05.790> better<00:04:05.970> than

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
you want them some ways look better than

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.460 
you want them some ways look better than
other<00:04:06.359> like<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:06.629> doesn't<00:04:06.989> look<00:04:07.139> very<00:04:07.199> good

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
other like that doesn't look very good

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.509 
other like that doesn't look very good
but<00:04:08.239> wait<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.349> does<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:11.159> looks<00:04:11.310> good

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
but wait this this does that looks good

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.969 
but wait this this does that looks good
so<00:04:12.150> here<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.449> is<00:04:12.569> with<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.810> golden<00:04:13.349> hoe<00:04:13.500> shovel

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
so here it is with a golden hoe shovel

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.770 
so here it is with a golden hoe shovel
and<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.099> fishing<00:04:14.340> rod<00:04:14.489> here<00:04:14.729> it<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.909> with<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.750> a

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
and a fishing rod here it is with just a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.909 
and a fishing rod here it is with just a
bunch<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.989> fishing<00:04:16.169> rods<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.620> here<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.829> is

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
bunch of fishing rods and here it is

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.640 
bunch of fishing rods and here it is
with<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.400> axe<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.509> some

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
with a axe and some

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.530 
with a axe and some
which<00:04:20.220> probably<00:04:20.880> would<00:04:21.000> look<00:04:21.120> better<00:04:21.270> like

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
which probably would look better like

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.530 
which probably would look better like
this<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:22.050> guess<00:04:22.350> yeah<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.340> looks<00:04:23.460> best<00:04:23.670> so

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
this I guess yeah that looks best so

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.480 
this I guess yeah that looks best so
yeah<00:04:24.750> there's<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.350> one<00:04:25.680> more<00:04:25.830> thing<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.310> this

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
yeah there's a one more thing and this

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.160 
yeah there's a one more thing and this
is<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.760> potion<00:04:27.150> rack<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.780> really<00:04:27.990> like

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
is the potion rack and I really like

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.350 
is the potion rack and I really like
this<00:04:28.320> one<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:29.040> because<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.580> adds<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:30.090> like

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
this one just because it adds in like

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.570 
this one just because it adds in like
lots<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.690> color<00:04:31.020> into<00:04:31.410> your<00:04:31.590> room<00:04:31.830> now<00:04:32.370> with

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
lots of color into your room now with

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
lots of color into your room now with
the<00:04:32.940> bookshelf<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.840> does<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> same<00:04:34.200> but<00:04:34.380> it's

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the bookshelf it does the same but it's

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.720 
the bookshelf it does the same but it's
always<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.710> same<00:04:34.740> color<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.310> with<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
always the same color and with this you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.730 
always the same color and with this you
can<00:04:35.850> definitely<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.720> know<00:04:36.840> any<00:04:37.410> color

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
can definitely get you know any color

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.100 
can definitely get you know any color
you<00:04:37.920> want<00:04:38.070> really<00:04:38.720> actually<00:04:39.720> with<00:04:39.930> all<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110

stuff<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.530> can<00:04:40.560> get<00:04:40.710> in<00:04:40.830> any<00:04:40.890> color<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:41.550> I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
stuff you can get in any color but I

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.920 
stuff you can get in any color but I
like<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> best<00:04:42.240> because<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.600> adds<00:04:42.750> in

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930
