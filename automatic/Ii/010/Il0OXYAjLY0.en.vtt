00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 elio the breaks and cobra today 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520

 youtube we meet for a video 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.570
 on black ops 3 but before starting 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.880
 with the subject I'm going quickly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.500
 present the crazy gameplay that you 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.410
 have it in front of you because it's a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.050
 world first dna to the shield made by 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.300
 my friend nardo on the strait map in 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.670
 simple domination which is therefore a member 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.100
 of my team language that had the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.570
 kindness to lend me this gameplay I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 I'm listening cf that I thank for advanced 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 if he accepts my video that contains a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 very very interesting info for the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 community of call of duty and I count 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.369
 to share this news then 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.619
 today I will introduce you to the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.869
 complete list of weapons of the next game 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.050
 from the call of duty saga that I found 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.850
 on the website black ops too - uk for 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 those who want to know the source 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.690
 so precisely this website has 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.080
 revealed screen shots guns 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.490
 assaulting sng snipers and so on 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.800
 I will immediately show you 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 your screen we can precisely distinguish 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.000
 among others quite a lot of old weapons 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.940
 previous code such as 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.149
 for black ops 2 the ballista at mp 7la 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 msm this is the case and I have unfortunately hmr then 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.869
 then for modern warfare 3 the acr race 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 because she cmp 901 the mink for ghost 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.530
 this is the 12 acca where badgers 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.980
 the n 27 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.650
 yesterday the msb is the same as at 14 and the v 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.630
 e pr and to finish the jci of modern 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.830
 warfare 1 and mw2 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 I hope I have not forgotten anything 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.270
 corrected month if necessary and we will 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.970
 finish with the guns which none 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.740
 old gun did not reindeer in the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.350
 list there are only new names 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.350
 new pistol good there is the 19 tac 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.530
 which may look like 45 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060
 but otherwise it's just new stuff 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.620
 so to the complete list 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.959
 that's how I told you 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.510
 glimpses a lot in these weapons that 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.150
 could come back on bo3 had 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.580
 outright a new design a new 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.709
 form a new color etc and this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.270
 would be a good idea to redo them 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.370
 live and that 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.290
 can for example feel on our 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.570
 lighthouse coast is playing there then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 we are sure bo3 and maybe it would be 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.250
 a new experience for us then 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.620
 that was the positive point we will say and 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.900
 regarding the negative point this 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.320
 could be had to copy paste would be 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 damage outright buy a ghost 2.0 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.360
 rot and it would be disappointing where I 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.550
 find to delight exactly the same thing 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.140
 to copy paste then voila me 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 personally I would find that 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 really super interesting is great 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.590
 to relive old codes 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.960
 that's what the community wanted 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.850
 and just imagine a call of like that 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.130
 with old weapons points to make 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.050
 relive the old school in the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.970
 frankly it would be really great 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.130
 pleasant and for the end do you think 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.080
 whether it is a fake list or not 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.510
 so I find that anyone 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.220
 can type weapon names and make them 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.230
 a screenshot but maybe this 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.150
 person who created this list has 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.220
 surely made analyzes of the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.290
 month trailer can be downright 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.880
 contacts at the producers 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.070
 but now you never know huh 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.260
 since this website is still 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.360
 pretty reliable they do not publish to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.910
 anything either so precisely 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.860
