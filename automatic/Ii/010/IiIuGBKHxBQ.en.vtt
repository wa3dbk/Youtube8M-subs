00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
i'll be showing you a technique that you

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.550 
i'll be showing you a technique that you
can<00:00:15.620> use<00:00:15.860> for<00:00:16.090> creating<00:00:17.090> tile<00:00:17.359> mosaics<00:00:18.020> you

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
can use for creating tile mosaics you

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.290 
can use for creating tile mosaics you
can<00:00:18.710> put<00:00:18.859> them<00:00:19.010> at<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.190> bottom<00:00:19.460> of<00:00:19.520> pools<00:00:19.760> you

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
can put them at the bottom of pools you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.640 
can put them at the bottom of pools you
can<00:00:20.510> use<00:00:20.660> them<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:21.109> decorate<00:00:21.320> your

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
can use them to decorate your

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.380 
can use them to decorate your
architecture<00:00:22.250> there<00:00:23.150> are<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> lot<00:00:23.359> of

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
architecture there are a lot of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.810 
architecture there are a lot of
applications<00:00:23.840> for<00:00:24.199> this<00:00:24.289> technique<00:00:24.820> what's

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
applications for this technique what's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.310 
applications for this technique what's
going<00:00:25.939> to<00:00:26.000> make<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:26.269> cool<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:26.720> we're<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.230> to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
that we got for creating this mosaic

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.880 
that we got for creating this mosaic
effect<00:04:23.050> I'm<00:04:24.050> going<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.290> go<00:04:24.470> ahead<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.680> blur

this<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:25.640> bit<00:04:25.760> because<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.390> want

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
this just a little bit because I want

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.650 
this just a little bit because I want
the<00:04:26.990> bump<00:04:27.200> map<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.730> catch<00:04:28.730> light<00:04:29.150> better<00:04:29.419> and

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
the bump map to catch light better and

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.420 
the bump map to catch light better and
this<00:04:29.750> will<00:04:29.870> create<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.169> smooth<00:04:30.650> curved<00:04:31.070> effect

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
this will create a smooth curved effect

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.290 
this will create a smooth curved effect
for<00:04:31.610> each<00:04:31.669> tile<00:04:31.970> let's<00:04:32.960> chart<00:04:33.850> same<00:04:34.850> process

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
the diffuse map and once for the bump

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.290 
the diffuse map and once for the bump
map<00:05:58.130> you're<00:05:58.669> going<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:58.940> get<00:05:59.000> two<00:05:59.180> different

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
map you're going to get two different

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.460 
map you're going to get two different
patterns<00:05:59.810> and<00:05:59.960> it's<00:06:00.050> not<00:06:00.169> going<00:06:00.289> to<00:06:00.380> look

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
patterns and it's not going to look

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.409 
patterns and it's not going to look
right<00:06:00.530> so<00:06:01.370> make<00:06:01.669> sure<00:06:01.700> to<00:06:01.820> use<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.120> technique

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
right so make sure to use the technique

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.880 
right so make sure to use the technique
that<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.600> told<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:02.960> because<00:06:03.169> that<00:06:03.620> will<00:06:03.740> let

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
that I told you because that will let

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.630 
that I told you because that will let
you<00:06:03.979> keep<00:06:04.190> the<00:06:04.520> same<00:06:04.729> pattern<00:06:05.090> for<00:06:05.270> both<00:06:06.640> so

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
you keep the same pattern for both so

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.100 
you keep the same pattern for both so
I've<00:06:07.729> brought<00:06:07.849> in<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.180> bump<00:06:08.360> map

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
I've brought in the bump map

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.600 
I've brought in the bump map
and<00:06:09.200> I'm<00:06:09.830> going<00:06:09.950> to<00:06:09.980> increase<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.430> bump

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
and I'm going to increase the bump

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.590 
and I'm going to increase the bump
amount<00:06:10.910> here<00:06:11.120> 20<00:06:12.250> 35<00:06:13.250> might<00:06:13.610> do<00:06:13.790> it<00:06:13.910> and<00:06:16.600> it

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
amount here 20 35 might do it and it

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.510 
amount here 20 35 might do it and it
looks<00:06:17.780> like<00:06:17.900> we<00:06:18.050> are<00:06:18.080> all<00:06:18.440> set<00:06:18.950> I<00:06:19.250> don't<00:06:19.430> think

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
looks like we are all set I don't think

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.160 
looks like we are all set I don't think
I<00:06:19.760> want<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:19.970> do<00:06:20.060> anything<00:06:20.240> else<00:06:20.510> this<00:06:20.660> material

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
I want to do anything else this material

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.330 
I want to do anything else this material
let's<00:06:21.500> take<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.680> render<00:06:21.950> and<00:06:22.070> see<00:06:22.160> what<00:06:22.250> that

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
let's take a render and see what that

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.390 
let's take a render and see what that
looks<00:06:22.400> like<00:06:26.470> okay<00:06:27.470> I<00:06:27.710> like<00:06:28.040> how<00:06:28.190> this<00:06:28.340> turned

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
looks like okay I like how this turned

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.030 
looks like okay I like how this turned
out<00:06:28.810> so<00:06:29.810> what<00:06:30.080> we've<00:06:30.200> done<00:06:30.230> is<00:06:30.440> we<00:06:30.680> took<00:06:30.800> the

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
out so what we've done is we took the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.910 
out so what we've done is we took the
original<00:06:31.490> painting<00:06:32.210> and<00:06:32.390> we<00:06:33.140> brought<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:33.800> into

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
original painting and we brought it into

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.250 
original painting and we brought it into
Photoshop<00:06:34.400> muddied<00:06:34.880> it<00:06:35.000> up<00:06:35.120> a<00:06:35.210> little<00:06:35.390> bit<00:06:35.570> we

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
Photoshop muddied it up a little bit we

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.980 
Photoshop muddied it up a little bit we
created<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.980> mosaic<00:06:37.700> map<00:06:38.000> that<00:06:38.240> we<00:06:38.330> can<00:06:38.510> use<00:06:38.540> in

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
created a mosaic map that we can use in

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.230 
created a mosaic map that we can use in
3d<00:06:39.530> studio<00:06:39.710> max<00:06:40.070> to<00:06:40.310> make<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.610> into<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.880> tiled

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
3d studio max to make it into a tiled

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.510 
3d studio max to make it into a tiled
mosaic<00:06:41.750> we<00:06:42.530> brought<00:06:42.710> it<00:06:42.830> in<00:06:42.950> as<00:06:43.070> a<00:06:43.100> ceramic

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
mosaic we brought it in as a ceramic

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.220 
mosaic we brought it in as a ceramic
material<00:06:43.550> and<00:06:44.090> rendered<00:06:44.300> it<00:06:44.420> and<00:06:44.600> it<00:06:45.080> looks

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
material and rendered it and it looks

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:54.220 
material and rendered it and it looks
great<00:06:52.480> thanks<00:06:53.480> for<00:06:53.630> tuning<00:06:53.930> in<00:06:54.050> to<00:06:54.140> another
