hi<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:00.930> mark<00:00:01.140> ram<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.560> today<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:01.920> taking<00:00:02.070> a

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi I'm mark ram and today we're taking a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi I'm mark ram and today we're taking a
look<00:00:02.310> at<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.380> GTA<00:00:04.380> 5<00:00:04.680> benchmark<00:00:05.400> test<00:00:05.700> I'm

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
look at the GTA 5 benchmark test I'm

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.830 
look at the GTA 5 benchmark test I'm
just<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> show<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:07.069> settings<00:00:08.840> all

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
just going to show you the settings all

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.870 
just going to show you the settings all
on<00:00:10.200> very<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> pretty<00:00:11.400> much<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:14.580> we're<00:00:14.790> just

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
on very I pretty much and we're just

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400 
on very I pretty much and we're just
going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.089> jump<00:00:15.299> right<00:00:15.420> into<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.929> benchmark

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
going to jump right into the benchmark

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
going to jump right into the benchmark
test<00:00:18.410> so<00:00:19.410> basically<00:00:19.680> I'm<00:00:19.830> using<00:00:20.070> an<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.580> 92<00:00:21.180> 95

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
test so basically I'm using an are 92 95

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.730 
test so basically I'm using an are 92 95
times<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.710> GPU<00:00:23.330> you<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> readouts<00:00:25.470> at

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
times to GPU you can see the readouts at

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.700 
times to GPU you can see the readouts at
the<00:00:25.830> top<00:00:26.039> right<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> screen<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
the top right of the screen and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
the top right of the screen and
basically<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> top<00:00:29.939> end

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
basically this is one of the top end

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.799 
basically this is one of the top end
graphics<00:00:30.660> cards<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> market<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.600> see<00:00:33.600> how

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
graphics cards on the market and see how

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.350 
graphics cards on the market and see how
it<00:00:33.989> fares<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.620> GTA<00:00:35.100> 5

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.720 

I<00:00:41.420> am<00:00:42.320> having<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.680> record<00:00:42.980> using<00:00:43.250> my<00:00:43.520> mobile

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
I am having to record using my mobile

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.480 
I am having to record using my mobile
phone<00:00:43.940> camera<00:00:45.100> unfortunately<00:00:46.100> because<00:00:46.430> I

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
phone camera unfortunately because I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.990 
phone camera unfortunately because I
don't<00:00:46.670> have<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.000> means<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:48.340> record<00:00:49.340> 4k

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
don't have the means to record 4k

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.840 
don't have the means to record 4k
without<00:00:50.830> influencing<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:52.070> benchmark

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
without influencing the benchmark

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.600 
without influencing the benchmark
results

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:03:51.710

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.130 

okay<00:03:52.720> well<00:03:52.930> that's<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.290> are<00:03:53.500> 92<00:03:54.280> 95<00:03:54.850> times<00:03:55.810> to

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
okay well that's the are 92 95 times to

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.370 
okay well that's the are 92 95 times to
GPU<00:03:56.800> with<00:03:57.670> GTA<00:03:58.060> 5<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.640> it's<00:04:00.640> kicking<00:04:01.090> I'm

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
GPU with GTA 5 and it's kicking I'm

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.890 
GPU with GTA 5 and it's kicking I'm
pretty<00:04:02.380> good<00:04:02.590> 60<00:04:03.040> frames<00:04:03.310> per<00:04:03.400> second<00:04:03.900> dipping

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
pretty good 60 frames per second dipping

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.890 
pretty good 60 frames per second dipping
in<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.110> out<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.190> I'm<00:04:06.520> Rob<00:04:06.700> Graham<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.240> thanks

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
in and out so I'm Rob Graham and thanks

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.470 
in and out so I'm Rob Graham and thanks
