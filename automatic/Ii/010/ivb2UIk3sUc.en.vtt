00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hmm 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:15.289
 I think that I would like to perform the sunset sky presentation using the light this time . 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.910
 It is divided into one big step, but it is so easy to see 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.300
 I think if you can 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.630
 First of all it is a movie this kind of form of the Well 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.920
 Now it is here a we have spread the sea It is the sea 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.920
 I would like to do this first c .3 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.489
 It applies to 3 seas and applies cc toner from the color collection. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.790
 I whole Well 1 seat adaptation to you and is now sepia Iroppoku 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.400
 Yes it's next but it's next 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.940
 Let's set the Kurushima by selecting from a Giyaï½°the Tteyuu new line bet 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.080
 It is already two cars and two stars 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.920
 I would like to ask you, but one such point code 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.950
 Well the color is a little like a sunset like dark color 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.809
 You Yes in the 400 field in collaboration such form 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.710
 Come This will 3 d layering a much less c press the ok and her husband already 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.900
 Something else 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.550
 It has become sunset Ppoku but one example it is another light 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.110
 This is a good ship This is light point height and white color 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.740
 And if you press ok to add , it looks like this 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 Two proofs or something like that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:27.770
 Just a good resonance or blend well 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:32.479
 You can produce it is sunset sky like a place in such a form 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 About I selected the character input tool and this time I typed in the characters 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.100
 Yes 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.430
 Let's say soft This is a form of art The mark of art has appeared 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 If this heart mark appears, from now on effects 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 Fractal noise and noise 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.430
 And I 'll put a blur of chaos Come on like this A heart is finished 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.649
 If 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.090
 The last is by doing so Come pull the overlay from the drawing mode 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.560
 It is correspondence that is free form 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 It is why it is possible to go back home 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.700
 Also, for example, if you have an illustrator logo 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.769
 You can switch to support as well. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:20.569
 In such cases to apply the ne First overlay Is 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.870
 And black and white fractal noise is here, select oldness and color here 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.230
 Then you will see 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:33.019
 Something you hard Ppoku such as correspondence ready 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.019
 And the noise and blur are depressed This can be completed in the same way
