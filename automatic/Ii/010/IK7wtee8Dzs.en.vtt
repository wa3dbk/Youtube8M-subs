00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.979
 I knew how to move and as I told you this 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.960
 let's play with the freezer avatar 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.670
 but with the good goku skin with the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.350
 OCU suit - shoes that I have 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.019
 different but I know it's not cool 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.150
 cool a lot and I like it more normal the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.460
 true this character but we are breaking 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.860
 a lot we are going to play this time versus 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.960
 the truth that this one here yes that 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.640
 it's very very very quiet by the way there 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 a little thing that I want to tell you now 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.480
 same because I love the beginning of the video 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 let's fight first against the normal 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.479
 and then it makes you the super perfect vale 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.710
 if you notice the bar is much more 

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.960
 strong that I worth the statistics that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.489
 has but I think I will win it will cost me 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.569
 but I will win many play is rim from 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.670
 the normal one wins it ring from the 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.789
 destroyed by the way a comic has come out 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.839
 about the movie 9 of dragon ball 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.760
 tell me the eating until legal 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.710
 would be to upload it worth of submitted in form 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.690
 but for comments please 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.489
 you want me to talk about that comic 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.899
 to contain movie spoiler 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.459
 but put it in the comments by 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.799
 please if you want to add something 

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:59.449
 referent that has stuck go by God 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.789
 referring to that comic because in this I 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.159
 tells things about the movie and the truth 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:09.289
 I said 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.149
 and successful all over everything because it successful 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:19.609
 completely everything I have left a little 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:21.140
 when he told me to see how to do well 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.270
 this character is no longer as weak as 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.450
 freezer good freeze rfc 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.750
 it's pretty good only that he's 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:44.629
 here part xl is incredibly good 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:46.189
 but throughout the 40 hits like this 

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.610
 it also takes away a lot more from me than 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.829
 I at the beginning of the technique takes away a 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.299
 heap more than half because he has 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.219
 more statistic than I do not carry things 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.629
 that uses super special here and I'm going 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.280
 to leave a little touched to give 

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.649
 try to beat up because it's coming 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.149
 here 12 and the limit I like to be 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.310
 to the limit because it makes you have what 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.569
 I do then it always makes me the barrier 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.099
 and if it were not for that barrier 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.359
 I think that barrier over I passed 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.259
 several people and they are very 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:13.849
 difficult 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.439
 but he's going to die because think and I like 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.970
 a little bit more and we're going to fight against 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.860
 be super perfect that in theory I 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.599
 It should cost a little more is more 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.700
 time is as spectacular as the one 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.040
 I played with freezer versus freezer but 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.560
 to see the following everything little by little is worth 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.150
 this week is that I think I should 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.220
 have green I convulsed beige or 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.019
 less almost what happens that I do not understand 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.379
 how has not already gone out there in the stock market 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.180
 see in Spanish I think for the 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.010
 Friday or Saturday and start to climb 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.720
 very history to the main channel I believe in 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.579
 I remember that the story of going up 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.709
 main channel and here I go up battle with 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.940
 my avatar or that more or less I want 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.620
 in me it's worth guys 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.010
 these are battle in little honor plan 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.750
 that are not good eliminates either the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.970
 history and everything ideal every principal 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.920
 and I also want to say that I will upload 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:06.319
 surely battle that you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:08.060
 tell also the handsome fellow 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.129
 I wonder also if you can catch 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.950
 several avatars that I can only 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.239
 select one vale 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.319
 you can select more than one avatar if you 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.310
 you want that avatar you're going to have to 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:23.480
 make a new game for you and that 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.650
 it seems to me it seems a little heavy to me 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.650
 it seems a bit that makes the truth 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:57.760
 this is the truth because quite a lot is not 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:57.760
 as I said 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.699
 Paris has been pretty bad 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.889
 my mother I have a field with cl that 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.030
 I shot the entity I got it two super 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.030
 every month but all followed 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.180
 It's so special 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.430
 because I am already of the race of the lands 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.450
 of the cold 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.720
 by the way the freezer knew about the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.400
 existence of that that according to him the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.010
 new movie does not seem like a big shit 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.510
 that he knew the world's assistance and 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.210
 I was afraid of them and never 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.080
 I would have been afraid because if I had 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.169
 afraid of them because there is no 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.300
 I was afraid to pass I do not understand that what 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.130
 I understand the truth another crap mccormick 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.520
 bread because a planned by the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.770
 movie said that such a fellow and not 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.770
 go and this there is a little more 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.740
 special that I'm going to do everything 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.169
 different because usually always the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.870
 same for tomÃ¡s I think that this technique 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.510
 it was old it was for america together 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.970
 damn if I'm in the limit was of 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:27.600
 radio itself without dying because 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:29.310
 there is five minutes and tonight in 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.660
 a video of theft that was with my super 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.120
 adult mecca creation that he has proposed 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.410
 on my twitter several times in the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.910
 creation that I am doing will revoke 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.080
 the truth that a very fun game and 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.820
 the truth that I recommend that you go through the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.930
 video super funny because I left the 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.180
 following videos but they liked it 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.100
 this one that involved my avatar with the 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.320
 goku clothes and put me the comments 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.880
 here also if you want me to upload some 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.410
 referring to the movie 9 aragon voley 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.510
 the comic to came out that contains spoilers 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.250
 By the way but hey I think that's 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.020
 quite important to make a video 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.420
 at least comment to me to kill that 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.330
 he is gorgeous and he is already and goku also not 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.330
 is finished
