00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello, it's welcome to this one. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
 sharing experiences 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.880
 The purpose of this video is to show how 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.969
 many people just as I have suffered 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.130
 to resolve the firewall 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.320
 windows who asks the same to be 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 linked by common means 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 this video exposes the habit of searching and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 follow the guidelines of people who 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
 have had the same problem in the meantime 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.269
 often the video lesson is not effective in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 its execution 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.070
 you will see the solution that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 I have found to solve this error in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.610
 however if you choose not to attend 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 to a whole video 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.950
 it will suffice to advance it according to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.230
 description of the video from the beginning of the lesson 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 how to eliminate this drawback 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 this video was made based on the study 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.930
 referring to windows 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.809
 8.1 installed four gigabyte memory 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.239
 5 operating system if it is best 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.940
 processor based on a strong former team 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 I stress to demonstrate 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.520
 because the end to my setback however not 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.890
 I can guarantee that this video you stay 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 without leaving percent of cases 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.080
 so if you can not solve 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.810
 following this tip that challenges 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.820
 further research decided otherwise 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 to solve this setback 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 also make a video and share your 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.409
 experience with others 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.020
 Thank you, I hope this exhibition can 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 be useful 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.369
 usually the antivirus sent the message 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.130
 firewall is off 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.869
 so we tried talking cock but like 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.960
 possible 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.850
 however an error message appears 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.189
 how to solve a problem when we are 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.420
 just trying to do something habitual and 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.600
 we could not 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.149
 as we all began to research if 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.610
 has anyone ever had a problem similar to 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.200
 first attempt and follow the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.920
 guidelines of the first pages of the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.990
 Google 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.390
 so we believe it will be very easy 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.310
 solve even more when the tips are 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.560
 from microsoft itself 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.269
 although I particularly never 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.310
 I appreciated the tutorials from 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.510
 microsoft 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.099
 the problem is solved as 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 now for example 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.790
 but still we still have the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.500
 hope 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.000
 this way from the second 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.480
 attempt 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.299
 the site is the same maybe it could already have 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.380
 I even gave up some blog research from 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.720
 microsoft 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.380
 however it would not be sensible of my 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.290
 part 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.560
 act with prejudice who knows this time 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.470
 the microsoft team can eliminate this 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.569
 and I may have a 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.730
 respect that the next experiment 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.620
 of the silva will call the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.819
 microsoft security scanner 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.780
 in my case for using the sic version of 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.569
 rockets 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.829
 The function of this tool is to make a 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.079
 search the system 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.319
 at the heart of the extension where there is 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.930
 likely to contain spyware and 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.310
 other malicious software good like me 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.319
 I do not really believe that the problem is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.310
 actually viruses or spyware opted for 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.710
 rapid examination 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.070
 the first alternative 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.780
 Microsoft suggests that it was really 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.090
 found something unwanted that is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 conducted a thorough examination 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.200
 In my case, as I expected, it was not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.320
 detected no threat anyway 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.120
 I will do the certification to see if the 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.970
 firewall has been started again by some 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.140
 virtual miracle 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.460
 unfortunately as I had imagined 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.460
 nothing solved 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.420
 This is now doing a search on YouTube 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.970
 in order to find someone who has had a 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.140
 similar problem has solved 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.740
 It seems like I've found something that goes 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.740
 solve my problem 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.970
 Quickly, already done. 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.210
 start the computer 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.400
 when you boot up you can see 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.090
 How are you going to board them if you have not? 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.090
 still activated 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 It will return to normal when we are 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.100
 behind a solution to some 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.410
 eventuality 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.900
 it is up to us at least to pay attention to what 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.310
 is being transmitted to apply 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.110
 in the photo in question 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.570
 only so we can judge whether the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.580
 was effective or not in accordance with 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.770
 channel suggestion third reading 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.430
 I downloaded the files and now I will execute 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.290
 the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.970
 if all goes well I'll be in movies 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.630
 using my computer 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.110
 be aware that this is the third attempt 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.000
 cool 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.430
 the first key here was inserted 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.780
 successfully 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.990
 still the installation of the second 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.190
 file to follow all the details 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.920
 orientation 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.200
 unfortunately, there was no such thing in the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.630
 installation of the second it 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.630
 and still do not know what to do would be 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.820
 risking a new scan in the system 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.180
 but this time apply the general examination 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.850
 opting for the second alternative in 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.940
 Microsoft scandal this check 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.090
 it's very time-consuming 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.210
 on this computer I spent more than three 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.210
 hours 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.350
 Now I'll do the filo's inspection to see 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.150
 if you can stay connected 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.150
 unfortunately nothing solved 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.090
 after several failed attempts 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.000
 in trying to solve the problem of 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.280
 firewall decides to forget a little and 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.730
 I searched for eliminated another fault that 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.300
 I was having my recordings 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.600
 was when I decided to pay a visit to the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.400
 task manager against the shift 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.480
 heskey and I noticed that on the services tab 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.480
 firewall that was stopped 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.460
 I thought maybe here I can activate 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.560
 it 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.020
 then right-click the 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.630
 mouse over it and noticed that there was 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.210
 option to start it was exactly what 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.680
 I did it after the action 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:30.650
 I did a new inspection through avast and 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.740
 I realized that now I had 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.750
 got connected 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.050
 It was great to have been able to see that 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.870
 message you are protected 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.190
 all modules are active the firewall 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.580
 is active 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.440
 everything is up to date I hope this 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.350
 discovery at random 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.320
 I have also helped you since neither 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.500
 even other tutorials in video lessons 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.880
 blogs teaching this way to activate the 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.910
 windows firewall 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.530
 Was this video helpful to you? 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.480
 share and so on this channel with 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:11.500
 sure there will be other experiences 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.500
 interesting even more and stay with God
