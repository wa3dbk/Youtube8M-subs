00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the food system it seems to me that we

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.500 
the food system it seems to me that we
can<00:03:47.829> either<00:03:48.010> pay<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.189> farmer<00:03:48.730> or<00:03:48.879> we<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.389> pay

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
can either pay the farmer or we can pay
