and as part of this too on the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
and as part of this too on the
unwrapping<00:02:10.729> process<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> things

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
unwrapping process one of the things

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.479 
unwrapping process one of the things
you'll<00:02:12.290> notice<00:02:12.379> is<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.709> take<00:02:12.890> some<00:02:13.099> really

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
you'll notice is I take some really

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.670 
you'll notice is I take some really
short<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.060> shallow<00:02:14.269> steps<00:02:14.780> back<00:02:15.049> only

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
short and shallow steps back only

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.839 
short and shallow steps back only
because<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:15.980> was<00:02:16.010> having<00:02:16.189> some<00:02:16.459> issues<00:02:16.819> with

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
because I was having some issues with

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.399 
because I was having some issues with
the<00:02:17.060> bar<00:02:17.359> banging<00:02:17.840> into<00:02:18.079> the<00:02:18.109> racks

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
the bar banging into the racks

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.530 
the bar banging into the racks
themselves<00:02:19.189> so<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.939> set<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.180> actually<00:02:20.510> a

better<00:03:06.200> low<00:03:06.470> bar<00:03:06.680> overall<00:03:07.159> so<00:03:07.700> there<00:03:07.849> you<00:03:07.939> have

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
better low bar overall so there you have

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.559 
better low bar overall so there you have

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
434 to I then moved on to deficit stiff

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
rep max so in this case I worked up to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.089
