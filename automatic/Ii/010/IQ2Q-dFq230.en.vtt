overhead and you'll see three extremely

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920 
overhead and you'll see three extremely
bright<00:01:07.310> stars<00:01:07.730> which<00:01:08.120> if<00:01:08.360> we<00:01:08.510> connect<00:01:08.810> with

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
bright stars which if we connect with

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.500 
bright stars which if we connect with
lines<00:01:09.200> make<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.710> huge<00:01:10.100> stellar<00:01:10.550> triangle<00:01:11.180> which

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
lines make a huge stellar triangle which

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.910 
lines make a huge stellar triangle which
is<00:01:11.660> traditionally<00:01:12.170> called<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.710> summer

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
is traditionally called the summer

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.640 
is traditionally called the summer
triangle<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:14.150> every<00:01:14.360> year<00:01:14.960> these<00:01:15.260> three

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
triangle because every year these three

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.380 
triangle because every year these three
stars<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.160> be<00:01:16.250> seen<00:01:16.460> rising<00:01:16.760> over<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
stars can be seen rising over the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.480 
stars can be seen rising over the
eastern<00:01:17.810> horizon<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.440> early<00:01:18.830> evening<00:01:19.220> at<00:01:19.370> the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
eastern horizon in early evening at the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.790 
eastern horizon in early evening at the
beginning<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.940> summer<00:01:20.180> but<00:01:21.140> since<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.530> stars

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
beginning of summer but since the stars

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.440 
beginning of summer but since the stars
change<00:01:22.220> their<00:01:22.430> position<00:01:22.850> with<00:01:23.030> each<00:01:23.180> season

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
change their position with each season

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.780 
change their position with each season
by<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.170> time<00:01:24.410> September<00:01:24.950> rolls<00:01:25.130> around<00:01:25.310> this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
by the time September rolls around this

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.180 
by the time September rolls around this
triangle<00:01:26.240> has<00:01:26.570> changed<00:01:27.230> its<00:01:27.470> position<00:01:27.710> so

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
triangle has changed its position so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.800 
triangle has changed its position so
that<00:01:28.220> in<00:01:28.460> early<00:01:28.820> evening<00:01:29.240> it's<00:01:29.360> almost

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
that in early evening it's almost

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.990 
that in early evening it's almost
directly<00:01:30.110> overhead<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.980> makes<00:01:31.430> an<00:01:31.580> almost

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
directly overhead and makes an almost

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840 
directly overhead and makes an almost
perfect<00:01:32.300> must-see<00:01:33.020> Labor<00:01:33.350> Day<00:01:33.560> tradition<00:01:34.010> now

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.460 
perfect must-see Labor Day tradition now
each<00:01:35.150> star<00:01:35.480> belongs<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> separate
