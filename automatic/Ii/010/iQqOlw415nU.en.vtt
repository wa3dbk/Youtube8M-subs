00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
okay this is my first track day with my

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.869 
okay this is my first track day with my
own<00:02:31.780> car<00:02:32.079> I've<00:02:32.709> been<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.099> couple<00:02:33.129> of<00:02:33.730> other

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
own car I've been to a couple of other

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.420 
own car I've been to a couple of other
track<00:02:34.180> days<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.780> driven<00:02:35.739> different<00:02:36.099> types<00:02:36.280> of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
track days and driven different types of

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.309 
track days and driven different types of
motorcars<00:02:36.939> obviously<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.049> your<00:02:38.200> own

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
motorcars obviously with your own

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.399 
motorcars obviously with your own
vehicle<00:02:38.829> it's<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> whole<00:02:39.400> new<00:02:39.609> experience<00:02:43.409> the

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
vehicle it's a whole new experience the

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.949 
vehicle it's a whole new experience the
track<00:02:44.650> day<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:45.129> I<00:02:45.670> suppose<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.359> an

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
track day is I suppose that an

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.349 
track day is I suppose that an
opportunity<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.829> get<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.250> get<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> know<00:02:49.239> your

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
opportunity to get to get to know your

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.929 
opportunity to get to get to know your
cup<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:50.349> advance<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:50.889> you're<00:02:51.040> driving<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.760> I

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
cup in advance as you're driving just I

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.879 
cup in advance as you're driving just I
suppose<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.959> normal<00:02:53.590> driving

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
suppose just in normal driving

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:00.410 
suppose just in normal driving
experience<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:55.359> you<00:02:55.450> get<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.720> chance<00:02:55.900> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.510

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
you can see this is where our company

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.330 
you can see this is where our company
started<00:03:23.700> which<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.630> very<00:03:24.930> much<00:03:25.230> small<00:03:26.069> days

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
couple of things one is obviously the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.259 
couple of things one is obviously the
controlling<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> vehicle<00:03:50.700> at<00:03:50.790> high<00:03:50.940> speed

through the corners obviously looking

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.820 
through the corners obviously looking
asleeping<00:03:55.019> where<00:03:55.200> you're<00:03:55.350> going<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.769> a

its limits of course but definitely here

its limits of course but definitely here
you<00:04:07.049> can<00:04:07.200> probably<00:04:07.410> excel<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.549> few

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
you can probably excel in a few

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.620 
you can probably excel in a few
different<00:04:09.030> areas<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.359> you<00:04:09.420> wouldn't

shiver Leggero as my wife says basically

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.830 
shiver Leggero as my wife says basically
it's<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:32.160> top<00:06:32.820> of<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:32.970> range<00:06:33.150> in<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.480> Giotto

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.170 
it's the top of the range in the Giotto
got<00:06:34.560> a<00:06:34.590> lot<00:06:34.680> of<00:06:34.710> carbon<00:06:35.160> fiber<00:06:35.430> in<00:06:35.700> the<00:06:35.790> vehicle
