00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.519
 among fun electric vehicles 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.710
 pure 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 we discovered the credit at the eicma 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.720
 card imported into Italy from pollens e 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 as you see in these images also or 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 collaborators and Lorenzo Ipichino does not have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 resisted the temptation to climb e 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.019
 to tell the truth 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 we tried a bit of healthy envy 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.040
 seems to drive a go kart up to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.320
 speed of 19 kilometers per hour but 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 lifting the drift bar you enter 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.649
 cray sicart mode the system would have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 given drift to the rear wheels 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 adjustable variables so it is possible 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 drive make evolutions both forward 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 back sideways diagonally and all 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.280
 what is possible and even imaginable 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.030
 with a radius of three hundred and sixty degrees 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.030
 it is possible to turn and rotate in place 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.830
 and this sport 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.370
 the kart crisis rocket won the award 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.190
 juice 2014 outdoor as a toy 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.890
 of the year and is already a cult product of 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.050
 strong impact of the united states that now 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 thanks to the Polini Motori distribution 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.520
 has all the numbers to become a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 very successful vehicle also in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580
 Europe 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.009
 the maximum speed is 19 kilometers 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.069
 per hour and the electric motor is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.039
 powered by two lead batteries 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.990
 sealed with 24 volt voltage is 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.109
 suitable for use by kids from beyond 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.580
 nine years and the weight of the pilot must not 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.580
 be over 63
