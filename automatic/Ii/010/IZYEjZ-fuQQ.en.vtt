00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.810
 new weight 84 beta 1 which came out 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 today for developers mainly 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.290
 innovation this and you have 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.740
 updated application music and I will 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 show it on ipad 3 and 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 see after work speed 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 this device on this device so 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.300
 First of all, let's run the settings and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.050
 let's look all over here with an example of something 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.820
 freezes 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.110
 One line of someone not as you can see from 480 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 his latest version 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 and so now let's go to the music application 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.070
 and we have an updated application 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 music 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.890
 look and slightly different now 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 My songs here are displayed in 1. this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.329
 my music 2 tab is playlists and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.329
 the third is itunes radio 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:08.700
 can also be switched from forts left 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.799
 right so let's go over here and here we are 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.260
 can choose songs album artists 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.630
 choose albums and as you can see on fate 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.830
 you got me three albums loaded artists 3 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.299
 artist go to the song and now 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.210
 run some song and run with us 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.740
 as you can see from the bottom this song appeared 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.740
 to open it fully push so 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.420
 as you can see 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:46.820
 and before us is a full player ps 84 and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 updated player swap bottom can be so 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 Principally convenient list is that we have from 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 nyx next song that will 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 playing here is a story and what to write 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.659
 that turns fun to live 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.119
 podlagivaet this in theory we can change 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.540
 which song will be the next to play like 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.540
 you see 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.090
 You can immediately delete this song with a wipe 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.280
 guru raised here will see 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.920
 the animation now crashes but still 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.110
 this beta 1 release can be all by 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.110
 everything will work smoothly 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.739
 so add example neto clicked example 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 tab add and here we add 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:45.129
 songs artists who will play 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.129
 not bad 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.160
 so also here we have a search even 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:01.420
 there is an example of wool paradise want songs 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.420
 coldplay and it started as you see 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:11.050
 the animation is a bit jerky in general 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:18.230
 Like all showed 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.910
 new in this player as you can see here in 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.290
 In general, such a player weighs 84 on ipad 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.440
 devices and so now let's see 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.100
 the speed of the animation is on weight 84 on 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.180
 ipad 3 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.070
 First of all, run the spotlight well 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 understandable as always slowing down here 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.310
 there is 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.590
 valid model 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.300
 so now outside ps tours 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.379
 download speed go out on former 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.379
 level 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.860
 a little bit longer probably 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.900
 okay now let's go safari see 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.980
 Safari will launch some site this is my 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.670
 site and you are running a term go to 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.670
 eurosport 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.860
 Che podlagivaet site heavy 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.820
 run the styling example freezes 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 of course tab compared with and you 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.840
 Gee, there a little bit less boulevard 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:13.280
 here it is more and so we will start the application 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:18.960
 photo example here everything is as before 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.440
 and run run run yet 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.440
 the camera 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:37.640
 now you see this is my camera case 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.600
 Well, nothing like as well as a camera and 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.600
 formerly working 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:52.540
 so now let's see the opening speed 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:54.870
 folders as always under the first run 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.380
 folders in the address they 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.380
 animation freezes 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.740
 open the bottom curtain 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.340
 top 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.340
 In principle, such is the speed of work and 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.770
 weight 84 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.770
 and finally, a couple will return the screen 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.710
 generally what tekram roll over 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:52.560
 smoothly principle not bad and so still 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:57.150
 let's run our menu like a century here 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.120
 more or less everything works smoothly if so 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:07.530
 everything is working 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:10.370
 gestures all very smoothly and in general here 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.360
 such as from 84 to ipad 3 as you can see 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.640
 of course podlagivaet 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.790
 I think his 83 he works better 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.260
 when but still this is the first beta and 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.930
 I hope everything will be in the final release 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.780
 work fine on this device and 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.850
 The main innovation of this OS is 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.350
 music offer updated 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:34.820
 and if you like this video set 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.820
 husky thank you for your attention
