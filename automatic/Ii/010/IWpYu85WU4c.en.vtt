settings I'm going to be showing you one

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.879 
settings I'm going to be showing you one
by<00:03:44.230> one<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.099> might<00:03:45.310> not<00:03:45.489> know<00:03:45.849> some<00:03:46.299> i<00:03:46.449> do

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
by one some I might not know some i do

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.289 
by one some I might not know some i do
first<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.129> rotation<00:03:48.639> angle<00:03:48.940> that's<00:03:49.090> why<00:03:49.269> i

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
first is the rotation angle that's why i

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.650 
first is the rotation angle that's why i
have<00:03:49.480> right<00:03:49.690> now<00:03:51.120> they're<00:03:52.120> they're<00:03:52.510> all

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
have right now they're they're all

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.199 
have right now they're they're all
rotated<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.250> better<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:54.699> careful<00:03:54.849> when

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
rotated so you better be careful when

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.390 
rotated so you better be careful when
adjusting<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.919> bad<00:03:57.099> thing<00:03:57.129> about

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
adjusting it and the bad thing about

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.460 
adjusting it and the bad thing about
this<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.419> have<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.870> risk<00:03:59.169> bring

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
this is that you have to risk bring

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.319 
this is that you have to risk bring
after<00:04:00.040> every<00:04:00.310> single<00:04:00.579> change<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:00.909> you<00:04:01.150> do

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
after every single change that you do

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.089 
after every single change that you do
say<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.959> mess<00:04:02.199> up<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.620> have<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.799> go<00:04:02.919> back

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
say you mess up and you have to go back

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.920 
say you mess up and you have to go back
and<00:04:03.159> then<00:04:03.400> with<00:04:03.579> spring<00:04:03.819> again<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.359> keep<00:04:04.750> on

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
and then with spring again and keep on

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.990 
and then with spring again and keep on
doing<00:04:05.199> that<00:04:05.230> over<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.620> over<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.699> kind<00:04:06.940> of

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
doing that over and over so it kind of

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.009 
doing that over and over so it kind of
