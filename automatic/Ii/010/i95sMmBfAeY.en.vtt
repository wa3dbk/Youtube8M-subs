00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
then you're gonna attach some more

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.090 
then you're gonna attach some more
ribbon<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.359> mixture<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.710> to

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
ribbon to the mixture that we have it to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.480 
ribbon to the mixture that we have it to
tie<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.000> jar<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.139> could<00:04:25.860> use<00:04:26.040> twine

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
tie it to the jar so you could use twine

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.250 
tie it to the jar so you could use twine
or<00:04:27.090> something<00:04:27.419> else<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.870> want<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.200> I

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
or something else if you want but I

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.719 
or something else if you want but I
thought<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> ribbon<00:04:28.889> was<00:04:29.040> pretty<00:04:29.400> festive

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
thought the ribbon was pretty festive

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.310 
thought the ribbon was pretty festive
and<00:04:30.540> again<00:04:31.229> this<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> little<00:04:31.979> bit<00:04:32.130> tricky<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
and again this is a little bit tricky I

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.100 
and again this is a little bit tricky I
would<00:04:34.320> have<00:04:34.410> been<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.889> actually<00:04:35.729> put<00:04:36.210> these<00:04:36.389> in

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
would have been I actually put these in

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.530 
would have been I actually put these in
between<00:04:37.290> my<00:04:37.590> legs<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.190> tied<00:04:38.490> them<00:04:38.639> with<00:04:39.360> my

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
between my legs and tied them with my

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.240 
between my legs and tied them with my
knees<00:04:39.780> holding<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.470> jar<00:04:40.710> which<00:04:41.010> worked

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
knees holding the jar which worked

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.790 
knees holding the jar which worked
pretty<00:04:41.520> well<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.330> here<00:04:42.930> for<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.260> shot<00:04:43.560> you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
pretty well but here for this shot you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.740 
pretty well but here for this shot you
can<00:04:43.979> see<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.280> was<00:04:44.610> struggling<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.300> little<00:04:45.450> bit

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
can see I was struggling a little bit

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.870 
can see I was struggling a little bit
but<00:04:46.710> you're<00:04:46.800> gonna<00:04:46.950> want<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.280> tie<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.580> really

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
but you're gonna want to tie it really

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.450 
but you're gonna want to tie it really
tight<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.500> could<00:04:49.650> even<00:04:49.830> use<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.100> little

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
tight and you could even use a little

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.840 
tight and you could even use a little
bit<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.789> hot<00:04:51.000> glue<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.950> secure<00:04:53.490> the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
bit of a hot glue to kind of secure the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.210 
bit of a hot glue to kind of secure the
ribbon<00:04:54.090> if<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.510> wanted<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:55.080> help<00:04:55.289> reinforce<00:04:55.650> I
