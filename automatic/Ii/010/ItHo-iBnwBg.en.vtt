00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.940
 Compact 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.680
 Easy to maneuver 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.500
 Easy to operate 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.280
 Use outdoors 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.600
 Hi, I am Mark from MAX_Mobility and today I will show you the techniques you need to know 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.380
 to get the most out of your SmartDrive outdoors. 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
 Let's go. 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.640
 Running with the SmartDrive is the same as running without the SmartDrive. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.860
 You simply brake lightly on the side you want to turn to and your wheelchair will go that way. 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.440
 With the SmartDrive motor on, 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.260
 it will feel like you are rolling down and that you are turning in a curve. 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.720
 So the SmartDrive keeps you moving even if you are on a flat surface 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120
 and you go around a corner. 

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.109
 Let's take a closer look. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
 Another way to turn with the SmartDrive is by hand braking on the inside 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.980
 and pushing with the hand on the outside to go around the corner. 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.920
 Cross and side slopes on the street are everywhere. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 They ensure water drainage from the sidewalks, parking spaces and exits. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.480
 Curbs can be difficult without a SmartDrive. But with the SmartDrive it can be very easy. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.620
 Let's see. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.120
 With the Smartdrive turned off on a side slope, 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.140
 do I constantly have to push with my low hand to drive straight, 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.820
 otherwise the wheelchair will turn and fall off the slope. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 So with the SmartDrive on, you simply make a hoop motion, brake with your high hand 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 and the chair will go straight on an inclined slope. 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.660
 When turning with the SmartDrive it is important not to turn too sharply 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.360
 or too fast for the environment you are in. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 You know when you turn too sharply or too fast because then you lose grip 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.780
 and you will go drifting in a corner. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.840
 The trick is to press the button, stop the engine and push at a more reasonable speed for that angle. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.880
 The SmartDrive has small rollers on the wheel that allow you to float over surfaces. 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.640
 But, be careful and make sure you don't get caught by things like cracks and cracks in the sidewalk. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400
 Be careful when turning. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680
 It is better to view it as rails and to ride diagonally on and over the hump, 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.740
 and not directly over it. 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.960
 Pushing up a van can be tricky. It's easy with the SmartDrive. 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.100
 But, it's important to practice. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.080
 The best way to climb a slope is to do this as slowly as possible. 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.600
 It's a very limited space, and you don't want to get in trouble there. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.660
 From the bottom of the ramp, push the engine as slow as you can and allow it to do the job. 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.040
 Once, all the way inside, press the button to turn the engine off. 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.020
 Driving up a slope with the SmartDrive is simple. 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.150
 Choose the speed at which you want to go up with that first push, 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 and make sure you are ready to stop at the top. 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.110
 So first push to get a nice comfortable speed; and then ready to stop at the top of the slope. 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.560
 It is always safest to switch off the SmartDrive before driving down. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.180
 That way you do not accidentally activate the engine and you will not get into trouble. 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.260
 That way you can easily stop at the bottom of the slope. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.120
 If you forget to switch off the SmartDrive before you drive down, 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.440
 It is important to know how you can prevent the engine from turning on. 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.280
 The SmartDrive is sensitive to acceleration. So the trick is not to speed up 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.800
 and go as slowly as possible, with a nice, even speed all the way down, 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.120
 and brake until almost complete standstill before the end, to be safe. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.240
 When you start at a hill with the SmartDrive, you can safely start by standing up so that you can rest and prepare yourself. 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.840
 When you are ready, turn to the slope, give the first push 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.640
 and then you can continue pushing to get the speed at which you want to go up the slope. 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.420
 So turn to the slope, push and let the Smartdrive start to go. 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.000
 If you want to go faster, push a little faster and climb the slope. 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.640
 If you have to stop at any time, the SmartDrive has an anti-rollback 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.780
 this prevents you from rolling back too quickly. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.720
 Just grab the hoops and push again to move forward. 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.680
 Two things you need to know about using the SmartdDrive when driving through doorways. 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.200
 The first is about how to take the threshold, or the hump that lies in the doorway 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.960
 And the second is what to do in case you suffer from the anti-recoil 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.400
 and it makes it difficult for you to roll backwards. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.640
 So the trick with the threshold of the door is to sit back a bit 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.620
 and allow your wheels to float smoothly over the threshold. 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.180
 If the anti-return feature switches on as you go through the door, just pause; 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.820
 The anti-return will switch off and allow you to go through the doorway freely. 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.620
 It is important that you pay attention to things such as cracks in the sidewalk, roots and obstacles 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.760
 while driving with the SmartDrive switched on. 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.760
 If you are not careful and hit one hard enough, you may end up on the floor, 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.780
 and you can be seriously injured. 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:37.060
 So keep your attention, see where you are going and do everything necessary to minimize the impact of a collision with these cracks during your ride. 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.120
 The trick with tearing is (1) knowing where they are 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.420
 and (2) remove the weight from the front wheels so that they float over the crack. 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.440
 So when you approach the crack, you lean back and give a little push 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.960
 so that your front wheels float on and over the crack. 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.180
 It is important that you know your limitations and the limitations of the SmartDrive. 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.280
 If the crack is too large, the SmartDrive will not help and may even cause you problems. 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.420
 It is best to switch the engine off completely and to bridge it manually 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.240
 and then turn on the Smartdrive again. 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.000
 While the SmartDrive will allow you to drive up and down curbs, 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.200
 it will not help you with this. 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.620
 So it's better to switch off the SmartDrive before you do this. 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.540
 That way you don't accidentally switch it on when you do a "wheelie" before you drive off the sidewalk. 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 It is important to protect your SmartDrive when you travel, 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.880
 otherwise someone could treat it incorrectly, drop it, break it and you will be without the rest of the trip. 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.160
 If you go in a taxi, do a normal transfer, and tell the driver how to take the unit off 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.780
 and let him give you the drive unit and battery, and place it in front of you. 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.000
 You do not want this in the trunk, rolling around, possibly breaking. 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.540
 When traveling by plane, use the SmartDrive in the normal way. 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.400
 Drive all the way to the door of the plane, transfer to the transfer seat 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.420
 and ask the flight attendant to remove the SmartDrive from the wheelchair, 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.900
 and the SmartDrive will be placed in the luggage compartment above your head with your hand luggage. 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.700
 The SmartDrive has a Lithium-Ion battery, 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.760
 that meets all aviation rules. Good trip. 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:21.050
 So now you know everything you need to know to get the most out of your SmartDrive outdoors. 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.230
 Be careful, have fun, 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.410
 And from all of us at MAX_Mobility, thank you for choosing the SmartDrive.
