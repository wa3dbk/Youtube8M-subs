00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.099

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.590
 macbook is what you use at all 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:30.109

 good little effect but I have a lot 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.820
 of painful friends who pollute my timeline 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 with tricks of the keynote so I 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 mutate the hashtag that notes to not see 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 and suddenly at the aesthetic level is this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 that you have an opinion on the lawn by 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.430

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 very beautiful and especially I have not yet 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.589
 serves something but I understand 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.939
 not as I understand why 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.740
 is that the iphone will be even 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.640
 bigger I do not understand no is this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.180
