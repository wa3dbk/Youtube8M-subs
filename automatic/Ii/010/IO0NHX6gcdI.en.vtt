00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.030
 hi how about i am triforce and here to 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.859
 then as you can see we are in 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.530
 a totally weird place since we're 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.290
 in a cousin's house and I'm going to 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.420
 take advantage of that she has the optimus lg 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.940
 he is 7 and he is going to update it 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.830
 and the living currently this is a 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.050
 team with ice cream sandwich is the l7 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.060
 that sells telcel is already connected via 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.340
 usb to the computer be cut with 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.599
 windows you need a new ones and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.180
 they have never done a good update 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.770
 then the gym page here is going to 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.500
 flashing the screen a little bit since it's 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.850
 a monitor crt but good hopefully it 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.129
 let me know a little bit there put the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.190
 page of the jeep dot com.mx go apart 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.230
 of cell phones or smartphones and then the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.519
 part of support seek the model of their 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.460
 team to start scratching 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.040
 work all the drivers that set apart 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.260
 from here it says software update and 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.690
 drivers and once they dropped all that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.790
 nothing else are two download the files that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.019
 is the drivers and they go and last is 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.110
 the application that is what is going to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.400
 update your device since what 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.230
 connect they recognize it 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.430
 and from here it clearly says that there is a 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.830
 new software version that is 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.710
 available to update the phone 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.790
 the model is a team sold in Mexico 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 it is a lp 708 that the version is the 2010 to 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 all since your computer is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.540
 connected to the internet to download 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 all the software will occupy the track 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.670
 in here the red button that says start 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 the update 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 we put them if that floor they were made 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 a backup 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.600
 we say yes 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 and will start working 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.030
 same here it can be a little slow already 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.040
 what 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.930
 the internal connection is not very fast that 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.810
 let's say a normal connection I think of 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.580
 12 megs but good more basically than 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.960
 I wanted you to see what you have to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.759
 do what they have to download so that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.380
 after the process is carried out in a 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.380
 automatic on your computer 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.900
 and all they have to do is 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.090
 follow the instructions step by step 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.090
 here of the application software 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.790
 I finished the process 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 I've been like watching you are recording a 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.520
 same with a smartphone also in case 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.110
 there's not much movement or something like that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 and you know the reason 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.380
 and as you can see the update weighs 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.600
 340 megs and it takes three then I think 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.600
 I'm going to pause this video and since 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.640
 I finished downloading because we continue with the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.380
 process and if not if it distracts me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.700
 when he can see how it ends 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.950
 they already had what they have to do 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.460
 is to download the page there 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.800
 application with the phone via usb and that 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.360
 basically it would be everything 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.940
 then I am triforce and you for 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.500
 android mx dot net and see you up 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.459
 the next one once they finish it's already going to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.459
 have the living 4.1.2 in his jee lc 7
