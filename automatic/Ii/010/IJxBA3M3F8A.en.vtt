everybody another love date on my solar
system

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.840 

it's<00:00:11.350> 12<00:00:11.620> noon<00:00:11.920> there's<00:00:12.220> not<00:00:12.340> a<00:00:12.370> cloud<00:00:12.610> in<00:00:12.670> the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
it's 12 noon there's not a cloud in the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.199 
it's 12 noon there's not a cloud in the
sky<00:00:12.910> I've<00:00:13.809> got<00:00:13.990> 400<00:00:14.230> watts<00:00:14.680> a<00:00:14.799> panel<00:00:15.190> on<00:00:15.400> the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
sky I've got 400 watts a panel on the

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.269 
sky I've got 400 watts a panel on the
roof<00:00:16.390> so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.980> I've<00:00:18.130> done<00:00:18.160> is<00:00:18.400> I've<00:00:18.970> swapped

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
roof so what I've done is I've swapped

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.269 
roof so what I've done is I've swapped
my<00:00:21.279> charge<00:00:22.150> controller<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.090> my<00:00:25.810> 2<00:00:26.130> 600<00:00:27.130> watt

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
my charge controller and my 2 600 watt

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
inverter of grid tie inverters I've got

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.000 
inverter of grid tie inverters I've got
a<00:00:30.100> boat<00:00:30.510> tied<00:00:31.510> in<00:00:31.779> at<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.990> same<00:00:32.230> time<00:00:32.500> on<00:00:32.860> this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
a boat tied in at the same time on this

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.900 
a boat tied in at the same time on this
switch<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.510> can<00:00:34.660> see<00:00:34.930> wanted<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.650> one<00:00:36.640> would

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
switch you can see wanted to one would

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.360 
switch you can see wanted to one would
be<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.300> charge<00:00:37.750> controller<00:00:38.010> two<00:00:39.010> would<00:00:39.250> be

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
be the charge controller two would be

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.189 
be the charge controller two would be
the<00:00:39.489> grid<00:00:39.699> tie<00:00:39.879> inverters<00:00:40.420> but<00:00:40.809> I<00:00:40.840> have<00:00:41.050> the

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
the grid tie inverters but I have the

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.130 
the grid tie inverters but I have the
option<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.920> switch<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.969> flop<00:00:43.210> them<00:00:43.360> up<00:00:43.540> to

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
option on the switch to flop them up to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.049 
option on the switch to flop them up to
both<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.590> them<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:45.460> we're<00:00:45.730> doing<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.969> little

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
both of them so we're doing a little

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.319 
both of them so we're doing a little
test<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.630> see<00:00:46.809> how<00:00:46.989> it's<00:00:47.200> doing<00:00:47.380> today<00:00:51.329> sit

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
test and see how it's doing today sit

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.590 
test and see how it's doing today sit
here

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.690 

that's<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.350> output<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:57.890> batteries

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:09.190 

input<00:01:01.570> from<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.230> solar<00:01:02.590> panels<00:01:04.020> so

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.080 

the<00:01:09.680> outputs<00:01:10.180> 13.4<00:01:11.180> balls

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090

46<00:01:15.049> wats<00:01:15.350> 3.5<00:01:16.250> amps<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.939> batteries<00:01:17.329> that

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
46 wats 3.5 amps to the batteries that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.140 
46 wats 3.5 amps to the batteries that
this<00:01:17.810> thing<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.049> on<00:01:18.289> float<00:01:18.619> right<00:01:18.920> now

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.260 

it's<00:01:23.960> what<00:01:24.170> we've<00:01:24.290> done<00:01:24.440> today<00:01:24.760> 12.9<00:01:25.760> hours

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.870 

it's<00:01:32.270> going<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.510> show<00:01:32.660> flow<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.260> in<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.380> minute

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
it's going to show flow here in a minute

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.150 
it's going to show flow here in a minute
it's<00:01:34.880> been<00:01:35.120> on<00:01:35.270> float<00:01:35.540> for<00:01:35.870> five<00:01:36.230> hours<00:01:36.260> and<00:01:36.710> 14

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's been on float for five hours and 14

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's been on float for five hours and 14
minutes<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.490> start<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:37.970> morning<00:01:38.410> I'm<00:01:39.410> sorry

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.190 

it<00:01:42.430> shows<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.390> because<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.840> was<00:01:43.960> flopping

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
it shows that because I was flopping

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.410 
it shows that because I was flopping
back<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.770> forward<00:01:45.150> working<00:01:46.150> on<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.360> thing

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
back and forward working on this thing

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.410 
back and forward working on this thing
but<00:01:47.370> then<00:01:48.370> go<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.760> my<00:01:48.970> grid<00:01:49.570> tie<00:01:49.750> inverters<00:01:50.350> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but then go to my grid tie inverters and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.210 
but then go to my grid tie inverters and
this<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:52.750> they're<00:01:52.930> doing

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.640 

while<00:01:55.760> charging<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.390> batteries<00:01:56.810> also<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:57.620> I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
while charging the batteries also so I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.980 
while charging the batteries also so I
think<00:01:58.220> that's<00:01:58.640> pretty<00:01:58.880> good<00:01:59.120> for<00:01:59.180> 400<00:01:59.810> watts

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
think that's pretty good for 400 watts

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.100 
think that's pretty good for 400 watts
of<00:02:00.200> pounds

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.540 

I<00:02:05.200> want<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.560> leave<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.860> on<00:02:05.980> all<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.220> time<00:02:06.370> i

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
I want to leave it on all the time i

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.200 
I want to leave it on all the time i
just<00:02:07.030> put<00:02:07.270> power<00:02:07.870> back<00:02:08.140> into<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> grid<00:02:08.710> and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
just put power back into the grid and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.630 
just put power back into the grid and
keep<00:02:10.210> my<00:02:10.330> batteries<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.929> plug<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.430> what's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
keep my batteries on plug this is what's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.410 
keep my batteries on plug this is what's
in<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> battery<00:02:16.270> bank<00:02:17.140> right<00:02:17.380> now<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
in the battery bank right now and it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.060 
in the battery bank right now and it
still<00:02:19.630> shows<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.110> charging<00:02:21.150> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
still shows it's charging so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.770 
still shows it's charging so
everything's<00:02:24.070> looking<00:02:24.250> good<00:02:27.570> very<00:02:28.570> very

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
everything's looking good very very

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
everything's looking good very very
happy<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.440> system<00:02:30.750> overall<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.860> was<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
happy with the system overall it was a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.199 
happy with the system overall it was a
bit<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.670> work<00:02:33.820> but<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:37.720> was<00:02:37.750> well<00:02:38.080> worth<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.560> I

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
bit of work but it was well worth it I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.620 
bit of work but it was well worth it I
put<00:02:40.209> some<00:02:40.390> new<00:02:40.510> lights<00:02:40.750> up<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.260> two<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:43.600> a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
put some new lights up to two and a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.380 
put some new lights up to two and a
light<00:02:43.870> everything<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:44.440> back<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:45.390> that
