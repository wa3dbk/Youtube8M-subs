defied<00:00:11.519> g2x<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:13.170> had<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> opportunity<00:00:13.590> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
defied g2x I have had the opportunity to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
defied g2x I have had the opportunity to
work<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.730> bigger<00:00:14.910> gimbals<00:00:15.330> but

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
work with some bigger gimbals but

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.599 
work with some bigger gimbals but
sometimes<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.800> need<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:17.310> more

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
sometimes you do need a little more

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.120 
sometimes you do need a little more
flexibility<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.810> where<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.470> feel<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
flexibility that's where I feel like the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.630 
flexibility that's where I feel like the
g2x<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> perfect<00:00:21.720> solution<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:23.070> amazing

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
g2x is a perfect solution it was amazing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.779 
g2x is a perfect solution it was amazing
how<00:00:23.789> much<00:00:24.269> creativity<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.289> had<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
how much creativity I had to think of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.169 
how much creativity I had to think of
shots<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> spot<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.760> rehearsal<00:00:29.760> time<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
shots on the spot and rehearsal time is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.350 
shots on the spot and rehearsal time is
is<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.840> low<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.430> light<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.030> can

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is so low because it's so light you can

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
is so low because it's so light you can
almost<00:00:33.480> shoot<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> rehearsal<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.890> can

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
almost shoot the rehearsal you can

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.810 
almost shoot the rehearsal you can
invert<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.630> g2x<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> sudden

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
invert the g2x and it's all of a sudden

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
invert the g2x and it's all of a sudden
much<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:39.090> comfortable<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.840> viewing<00:00:40.200> angle

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
much more comfortable the viewing angle

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
much more comfortable the viewing angle
is<00:00:40.620> much<00:00:40.890> better<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> allows<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> track

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
is much better it allows you to track

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 
is much better it allows you to track
with<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:42.780> subject<00:00:43.200> much<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.160> comfortably

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
with your subject much more comfortably

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
with your subject much more comfortably
because<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.690> holding<00:00:46.050> position<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.530> much

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because the holding position is much

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
because the holding position is much
more<00:00:46.800> natural<00:00:47.809> there<00:00:48.809> were<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> couple<00:00:48.989> shots

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
more natural there were a couple shots

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
more natural there were a couple shots
where<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.550> started<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.210> low<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
where we started out really low and we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.529 
where we started out really low and we
wanted<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.500> into<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.370> high<00:00:53.730> shot<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.390> eye

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
wanted to go into a high shot or an eye

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
wanted to go into a high shot or an eye
level<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.920> light<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.090> hold<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
level it's so light that you can hold it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
level it's so light that you can hold it
with<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.480> finger<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.199> while<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:58.920> walking

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
with one finger and while you're walking

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
with one finger and while you're walking
you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.730> raise<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> level<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.750> even

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you can raise it up I level or even

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
you can raise it up I level or even
above<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:02.160> worked<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.940> bigger<00:01:03.270> gimbals

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
above I've worked with bigger gimbals

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560 
above I've worked with bigger gimbals
you<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.470> fatigued<00:01:04.890> pretty<00:01:05.280> quickly<00:01:05.489> ran<00:01:06.450> all

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you get fatigued pretty quickly ran all

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
you get fatigued pretty quickly ran all
day<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:08.040> lighter<00:01:08.430> gimbals

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
day with this one with lighter gimbals

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.690 
day with this one with lighter gimbals
typically<00:01:09.890> things<00:01:10.890> aren't<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.400> smooth

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
typically things aren't as smooth

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
typically things aren't as smooth
because<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> weight<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
because you don't have the weight it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 
because you don't have the weight it
wasn't<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> case<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> was

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
wasn't the case with this one I was

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270 
wasn't the case with this one I was
amazed<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> number<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.770> times<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
amazed at the number of times that I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
amazed at the number of times that I
thought<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> missed<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> shot<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.470> we

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
thought I missed the shot and then we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.820 
thought I missed the shot and then we
viewed<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.180> rock<00:01:21.420> solid

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.790 

portability<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.120> big<00:01:27.630> deal<00:01:27.870> for<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> do

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
portability is a big deal for what I do

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.300 
portability is a big deal for what I do

used<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> shooting<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.860> bigger<00:01:38.760> cameras
