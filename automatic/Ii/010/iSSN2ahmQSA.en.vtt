00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it was an Intel machine however when I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.029 
it was an Intel machine however when I
got<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.199> turned<00:00:19.470> out<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.770> running

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

got it it turned out to be running
Leopard<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:21.210> turned<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
Leopard and it turned out to be a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.300 
Leopard and it turned out to be a
PowerPC<00:00:22.800> g4<00:00:23.580> based<00:00:23.910> Mac<00:00:24.330> Mini<00:00:24.859> now<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> did<00:00:26.160> get

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
overview of the machine and then we'll

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.060 
overview of the machine and then we'll
go<00:00:44.100> ahead<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> boot<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.239> yeah<00:00:46.079> alright

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so in the front here we have a slot

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
so in the front here we have a slot
loading<00:00:49.590> optical<00:00:50.219> drive<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
loading optical drive I'm pretty sure it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
loading optical drive I'm pretty sure it
is<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.289> combo<00:00:52.770> Drive<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> hundred

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is just a combo Drive I'm not a hundred

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
is just a combo Drive I'm not a hundred
percent<00:00:53.850> sure<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> though<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> will

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
percent sure on that though but I will

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.479 
percent sure on that though but I will
check<00:00:56.250> once<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.969> boot<00:00:57.149> into<00:00:57.390> OS<00:00:57.780> 10<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.250> right

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
check once we boot into OS 10 and right

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.930 
check once we boot into OS 10 and right
on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> bottom<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.899> power<00:01:01.260> LED

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
on the bottom there we have a power LED

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
on the bottom there we have a power LED

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
now on both sides of the machine we

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
now on both sides of the machine we
don't<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.949> anything<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.519> all

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
Ethernet port is actually a bit messed

up<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.150> now<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> haven't

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
up as you can see now I haven't

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
up as you can see now I haven't
attempted<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.860> repair<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.240> even<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
attempted to repair it but even if I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.330 
attempted to repair it but even if I
can't<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.740> no<00:01:31.890> big<00:01:32.040> deal

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
can't it's really no big deal

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.810 
can't it's really no big deal
as<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.240> machine<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.579> Wi-Fi<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
as this machine has the Wi-Fi and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.690 
as this machine has the Wi-Fi and
bluetooth<00:01:36.240> module<00:01:36.840> installed<00:01:37.530> well<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
bluetooth module installed well what I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
bluetooth module installed well what I
mean<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.090> say<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.840> this

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
mean when I say that is that this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.609 
mean when I say that is that this
machine<00:01:40.409> has<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.750> separate<00:01:42.750> card<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
machine has a separate card that the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
machine has a separate card that the
Airport<00:01:44.040> Extreme<00:01:44.280> card<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.119> Bluetooth<00:01:45.509> card

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
Airport Extreme card in Bluetooth card

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.480 
Airport Extreme card in Bluetooth card
go<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.970> without<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.409> card<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> can't

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
go on so without that one card you can't

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
go on so without that one card you can't
actually<00:01:50.729> install<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.509> airport<00:01:51.960> card<00:01:52.200> or

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
actually install an airport card or

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually install an airport card or
bluetooth<00:01:52.979> card<00:01:53.250> which<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.909> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> weird

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
bluetooth card which is kind of weird

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
bluetooth card which is kind of weird
but<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.040> these<00:01:56.189> machines<00:01:56.399> are

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
but that's just how these machines are

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.480 
but that's just how these machines are

yeah<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.650> best<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.550> works<00:03:32.790> for

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
yeah it's not the best but it works for

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.770 
yeah it's not the best but it works for
testing

ahead and do more info here all right so
you<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:47.650> see<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> machine<00:04:48.010> overview<00:04:48.760> there

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
you can see the machine overview there

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.800 
you can see the machine overview there
um<00:04:50.380> let<00:04:51.130> me<00:04:51.220> go<00:04:51.370> ahead<00:04:51.490> into<00:04:51.970> graphics<00:04:52.630> and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
um let me go ahead into graphics and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.440 
um let me go ahead into graphics and
displays<00:04:53.260> um<00:04:54.250> as<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.640> see<00:04:54.910> here<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.420> has

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
displays um as you can see here it has

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.450 
displays um as you can see here it has

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card and it

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.810 
an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card and it
only<00:05:00.580> has<00:05:00.790> 32<00:05:01.480> megabytes<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:02.230> video<00:05:02.410> memory

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
only has 32 megabytes of video memory

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.690 
only has 32 megabytes of video memory
now<00:05:03.820> this<00:05:04.030> is<00:05:04.180> quite<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:05.650> card<00:05:06.190> performs

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
now this is quite this card performs

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.580 
now this is quite this card performs
quite<00:05:07.000> poorly<00:05:07.330> under<00:05:07.660> Leopard<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.260> doesn't

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
quite poorly under Leopard it doesn't

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.130 
quite poorly under Leopard it doesn't
support<00:05:08.710> quartz<00:05:09.280> or<00:05:09.700> core<00:05:10.000> image<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.900> does

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
support quartz or core image it does

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.560 
support quartz or core image it does
support<00:05:11.320> coarse<00:05:11.680> extreme<00:05:12.100> however<00:05:12.310> but<00:05:13.300> all

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
support coarse extreme however but all

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.860 
support coarse extreme however but all
the<00:05:13.690> animations<00:05:14.290> are<00:05:14.410> kind<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.800> laggy<00:05:15.040> and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
the animations are kind of laggy and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.540 
the animations are kind of laggy and
overall<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.990> user<00:05:17.200> experience<00:05:17.830> really<00:05:18.070> isn't

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
overall the user experience really isn't

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.210 
overall the user experience really isn't
that<00:05:18.730> great<00:05:19.060> as<00:05:19.330> I'll<00:05:19.510> show<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.920> can<00:05:21.040> see

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
that great as I'll show you you can see

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.950 
that great as I'll show you you can see
them<00:05:21.400> minimize<00:05:21.790> animation<00:05:22.420> is<00:05:22.510> just<00:05:22.750> pretty

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
them minimize animation is just pretty

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.710 
them minimize animation is just pretty
laggy<00:05:23.290> so<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.700> stack<00:05:27.700> animation<00:05:28.390> this<00:05:28.540> and

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
laggy so is the stack animation this and

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.000 
laggy so is the stack animation this and
such<00:05:30.060> so<00:05:31.060> yeah<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.960> is<00:05:32.020> running<00:05:32.470> at<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.620> pretty

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
such so yeah this is running at a pretty

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.790 
such so yeah this is running at a pretty
low<00:05:33.190> resolution<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.850> that<00:05:34.560> speeds<00:05:35.560> up<00:05:35.740> the

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
low resolution so that speeds up the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.500 
low resolution so that speeds up the
performance<00:05:36.190> at<00:05:36.610> least<00:05:36.790> a<00:05:36.880> little<00:05:37.000> bit<00:05:37.150> if<00:05:37.419> I

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
performance at least a little bit if I

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.020 
performance at least a little bit if I
were<00:05:37.660> using<00:05:37.840> this<00:05:38.050> on<00:05:38.260> a<00:05:38.580> monitor<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.610> had<00:05:40.000> a

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
were using this on a monitor that had a

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.280 
were using this on a monitor that had a
higher<00:05:40.300> resolution<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.990> would<00:05:41.080> probably

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
higher resolution it would probably

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.730 
higher resolution it would probably
perform<00:05:41.890> even<00:05:42.160> worse<00:05:42.460> so<00:05:42.970> yeah<00:05:43.840> let<00:05:44.590> me<00:05:44.620> go

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
perform even worse so yeah let me go

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.380 
perform even worse so yeah let me go
ahead<00:05:44.830> into<00:05:45.160> disc<00:05:45.490> burning<00:05:45.910> and<00:05:46.030> we'll<00:05:46.150> see

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
ahead into disc burning and we'll see

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.900 
ahead into disc burning and we'll see
what<00:05:46.630> type<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:46.840> drawing<00:05:47.169> this<00:05:47.380> is<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:48.280> it

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
what type of drawing this is and it

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.740 
what type of drawing this is and it
appears<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.450> be<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:50.140> combo<00:05:50.950> Drive<00:05:51.280> as<00:05:51.750> it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
appears to be a combo Drive as it

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.159 
appears to be a combo Drive as it
doesn't<00:05:53.020> appear<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.590> be<00:05:53.860> able<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.840> or<00:05:55.840> no<00:05:55.990> this

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
doesn't appear to be able to or no this

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.710 
doesn't appear to be able to or no this
is<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.350> super<00:05:56.680> drive<00:05:56.919> my<00:05:57.160> bad<00:05:57.340> it<00:05:57.520> can<00:05:57.700> read<00:05:57.970> or

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
is a super drive my bad it can read or

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.440 
is a super drive my bad it can read or
it<00:05:58.840> can<00:05:59.050> write<00:05:59.260> DVDs<00:05:59.770> and<00:06:00.070> CDs<00:06:00.310> so<00:06:00.700> yes<00:06:00.910> it<00:06:01.090> is<00:06:01.150> a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
it can write DVDs and CDs so yes it is a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.880 
it can write DVDs and CDs so yes it is a
super<00:06:01.930> drive<00:06:02.169> so<00:06:02.980> that's<00:06:03.100> pretty<00:06:03.280> nice<00:06:04.800> let<00:06:05.800> me

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
super drive so that's pretty nice let me

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.029 
super drive so that's pretty nice let me
go<00:06:05.980> check<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.520> hard<00:06:06.790> drive<00:06:07.060> size

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.429 

tell<00:06:12.039> you<00:06:12.130> there

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:26.500 

go<00:06:17.039> ahead<00:06:17.189> the<00:06:17.369> Disk<00:06:17.610> Utility

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.050 

so<00:06:27.140> yes<00:06:27.410> it<00:06:27.590> does<00:06:27.770> have<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.160> original<00:06:28.280> 80

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
so yes it does have the original 80

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.300 
so yes it does have the original 80
gigabyte<00:06:29.600> hard<00:06:29.810> drive<00:06:29.900> installed<00:06:30.560> so<00:06:31.070> yeah

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
gigabyte hard drive installed so yeah

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.790 
gigabyte hard drive installed so yeah
this<00:06:31.880> machine<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.540> perfectly<00:06:33.170> original<00:06:33.710> one

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
this machine is perfectly original one

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.160 
this machine is perfectly original one
hasn't<00:06:33.950> been<00:06:34.130> upgraded<00:06:34.700> to<00:06:34.790> at<00:06:34.940> all<00:06:35.090> so<00:06:36.050> yeah

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
hasn't been upgraded to at all so yeah

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:43.540 
hasn't been upgraded to at all so yeah
that's<00:06:36.320> pretty<00:06:36.380> interesting<00:06:42.280> so<00:06:43.280> as<00:06:43.370> you<00:06:43.460> can

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
that's pretty interesting so as you can

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.850 
that's pretty interesting so as you can
see<00:06:43.610> it<00:06:43.790> is<00:06:43.910> connected<00:06:44.300> to<00:06:44.360> Wi-Fi<00:06:44.540> here<00:06:45.080> now<00:06:45.830> I

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
see it is connected to Wi-Fi here now I

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.230 
see it is connected to Wi-Fi here now I
haven't<00:06:46.190> really<00:06:46.370> installed<00:06:46.730> a<00:06:46.820> third-party

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
haven't really installed a third-party

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.940 
haven't really installed a third-party
browser<00:06:47.630> I<00:06:47.840> would<00:06:48.080> normally<00:06:48.230> use<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:48.710> rock

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
browser I would normally use the rock

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.160 
browser I would normally use the rock

leopard<00:06:51.500> but<00:06:52.480> safaris<00:06:53.480> pretty<00:06:54.290> decent<00:06:54.710> on

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
leopard but safaris pretty decent on

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.290 
leopard but safaris pretty decent on
these<00:06:54.920> machines<00:06:56.110> so<00:06:57.110> yeah<00:06:57.910> it<00:06:58.910> works<00:06:59.090> pretty

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
these machines so yeah it works pretty

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.690 
these machines so yeah it works pretty
well<00:06:59.570> it<00:06:59.780> is<00:06:59.870> pretty<00:07:00.080> slow<00:07:00.470> especially<00:07:00.740> when

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
well it is pretty slow especially when

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.790 
well it is pretty slow especially when
playing<00:07:01.940> YouTube<00:07:02.330> videos<00:07:02.660> it<00:07:02.930> can<00:07:02.960> hardly

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
playing YouTube videos it can hardly

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.910 
playing YouTube videos it can hardly
play<00:07:04.040> it<00:07:04.220> 360<00:07:04.820> P<00:07:05.320> that's<00:07:06.320> probably<00:07:06.650> just

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
play it 360 P that's probably just

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.280 
play it 360 P that's probably just
mainly<00:07:07.130> due<00:07:07.400> to<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:07.730> poor<00:07:08.210> graphics<00:07:08.540> or<00:07:09.260> the

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290 
mainly due to the poor graphics or the

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.040 
mainly due to the poor graphics or the
poor<00:07:09.620> GPU<00:07:10.100> that's<00:07:10.250> in<00:07:10.430> this<00:07:10.580> system<00:07:10.990> so<00:07:11.990> I'm

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
poor GPU that's in this system so I'm

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.300 
poor GPU that's in this system so I'm
not<00:07:12.140> really<00:07:12.380> going<00:07:12.500> to<00:07:12.560> show<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:12.920> because

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
not really going to show that because

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.850 
not really going to show that because
it's<00:07:13.640> not<00:07:13.820> really<00:07:14.060> worth<00:07:14.240> showing<00:07:14.510> but<00:07:14.930> yeah

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
it's not really worth showing but yeah

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.850 
it's not really worth showing but yeah
that<00:07:16.130> is<00:07:16.160> the<00:07:16.400> machine<00:07:16.970> so<00:07:17.480> I'm<00:07:18.320> go<00:07:18.500> ahead<00:07:18.710> and

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
that is the machine so I'm go ahead and

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:32.180 
that is the machine so I'm go ahead and
shut<00:07:19.070> it<00:07:19.100> you<00:07:19.280> know

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190
