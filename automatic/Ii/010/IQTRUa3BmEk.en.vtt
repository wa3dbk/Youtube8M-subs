00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello how is this song as it comes out 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.990
 Accompaniment is not very complicated like this 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.930
 that encourage you to learn the word 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.940
 good we start in the chord of fa with 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.940
 the left hand marking this rhythm 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.130
 we have given 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.220
 the mud 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.440
 we go to the minor re ' 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.920
 then sun 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.920
 ah 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.800
 those chords are also made by hand 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.660
 right exactly the same 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.660
 only that when we are doing 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.310
 we now pass lower 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.850
 because with the left hand instead of 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.909
 ascend descend to the sun here 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.170
 but here it is to ascend since we are of the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.909
 Sun 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 and we change to the next one agreed that it is 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 easy to highlight 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.900
 and with the left hand we mark the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.900
 dakar 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.620
 good for the chorus part we just go 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.120
 to make these chords 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.120
 re minor to minor my sun 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.140
 my minor sun 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.140
 it repeats 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.040
 and the rest of the chorus part is 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.890
 exactly the same as the left hand 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.830
 marking those chords here with your hand 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.830
 right let's do this 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
 reduced 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:13.620
 my neighbor 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 and here they have stopped the juices 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.520
 and with our left hand we do this 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.950
 and the rest of the song is 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.610
 exactly the same good see you in the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.610
