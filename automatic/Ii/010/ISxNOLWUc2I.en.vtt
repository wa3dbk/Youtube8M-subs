you<00:02:44.989> just<00:02:45.200> want<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.380> make<00:02:45.530> sure<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.920> you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
you just want to make sure that you

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.120 
you just want to make sure that you
drain<00:02:46.310> off<00:02:46.520> all<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.330> liquid<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.130> this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
drain off all of the liquid so this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.460 
drain off all of the liquid so this
looks<00:02:49.370> done<00:02:49.640> once<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.000> beef<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.540> no<00:02:50.959> longer

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
once you got one layer down just want to

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.680 
once you got one layer down just want to
put<00:03:18.019> some<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.290> your<00:03:18.590> meat<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:20.120> try<00:03:20.299> to<00:03:20.360> get<00:03:20.540> it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690

even and if you want to do this on a big
baking<00:03:23.030> sheet<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.570> do<00:03:23.690> one<00:03:23.870> layer

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
baking sheet and just do one layer

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.390 
baking sheet and just do one layer
that's<00:03:24.380> totally<00:03:24.830> fine

that's totally fine

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.190 
that's totally fine
but<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.610> tall<00:03:25.880> stack<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.269> nachos<00:03:26.630> just<00:03:26.959> seems

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
but a tall stack of nachos just seems

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.310 
but a tall stack of nachos just seems
more<00:03:27.530> celebratory<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.489> I'm<00:03:29.360> gonna<00:03:29.510> do<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.989> stack

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
more celebratory so I'm gonna do a stack

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.170 
more celebratory so I'm gonna do a stack
and<00:03:30.620> then<00:03:30.680> we'll<00:03:30.860> sprinkle<00:03:31.130> some<00:03:31.459> cheese<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
and then we'll sprinkle some cheese and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.960 
and then we'll sprinkle some cheese and
be<00:03:32.630> generous<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.760> there's<00:03:34.760> something

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
be generous because there's something

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.850 
be generous because there's something
weird<00:03:35.360> about<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> physics<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.440> nachos

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
weird about like the physics of nachos

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.470 
weird about like the physics of nachos
and<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.640> cheese<00:03:37.880> always<00:03:38.239> looks

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and that is that cheese always looks

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:52.830 
and that is that cheese always looks
like<00:03:38.540> less<00:03:38.930> ones<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.350> melted
