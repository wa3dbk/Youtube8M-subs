massively<00:00:40.270> about<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.110> think<00:00:41.170> there's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
massively about and I think there's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.420 
massively about and I think there's
still<00:00:41.530> worse<00:00:41.950> to<00:00:42.160> come

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
still worse to come

still worse to come
so<00:00:42.760> at<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:42.940> moment<00:00:43.180> we're<00:00:43.270> only<00:00:43.300> at<00:00:43.570> 11:30

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079

year it's a completely frivolous use and
also<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:03.350> very<00:01:03.710> unreliable<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.430> data<00:01:04.610> that

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
also it's very unreliable the data that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:12.310 
also it's very unreliable the data that
you<00:01:04.850> get<00:01:05.000> anyway<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:11.149> cosmetics<00:01:11.750> directive

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
you get anyway the cosmetics directive

you get anyway the cosmetics directive
is<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.470> really<00:01:12.740> positive<00:01:13.040> piece<00:01:13.580> of

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
is a really positive piece of

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.359 
is a really positive piece of
legislation<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.570> animals<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.530> was<00:01:15.710> passed<00:01:16.009> in

animals could be tested on for cosmetics

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.190 
animals could be tested on for cosmetics
but<00:01:27.440> unfortunately<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.450> cosmetics<00:01:30.080> industry

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
but unfortunately the cosmetics industry

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.469 
but unfortunately the cosmetics industry
lobbied<00:01:30.920> behind<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.520> scenes<00:01:31.759> after<00:01:32.390> the

another delay

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.609 
another delay
and<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.150> far<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.540> been<00:01:38.630> 20<00:01:39.110> years<00:01:39.140> and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
and so far it's been 20 years and

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.140 
and so far it's been 20 years and
they're<00:01:39.740> currently<00:01:40.130> asking<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.729> another<00:01:40.909> 10

a<00:01:49.790> lot<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:50.940> shocking<00:01:51.390> than<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.600> anticipated<00:01:51.870> I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
a lot more shocking than I anticipated I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.290

think<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> knew<00:01:53.760> what<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
think we kind of knew what was going to

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.770

police down which have the RSPCA down

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
police down which have the RSPCA down
we'd<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> animal<00:02:34.170> rights

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
we'd have all of the animal rights

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.380 
we'd have all of the animal rights
groups<00:02:34.860> up<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.130> arms<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:35.970> know<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.209> fact

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
groups up in arms but you know the fact

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
groups up in arms but you know the fact
that<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> something<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.080> goes<00:02:37.230> on

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that this is something that goes on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.440 
that this is something that goes on
daily<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.160> laboratories<00:02:38.790> across<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.240> world

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
daily in laboratories across the world

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 
daily in laboratories across the world
without<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.170> sort<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.739> protest<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.459> really

we<00:02:51.489> just<00:02:51.730> finished<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.540> performance<00:02:53.200> in

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
we just finished the performance in

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.960 
we just finished the performance in
Regent<00:02:53.739> Street<00:02:53.800> with<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.310> animal<00:02:54.730> test

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
Regent Street with the animal test

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.020 
Regent Street with the animal test
subject<00:02:55.569> being<00:02:56.530> killed<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:57.580> taken<00:02:57.940> out

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
subject being killed and then taken out

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.059 
subject being killed and then taken out
to<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.239> bins<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.319> reality<00:02:59.530> for

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
to the bins and this is the reality for

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.890 
to the bins and this is the reality for
millions<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.700> laboratory<00:03:01.300> animals<00:03:01.660> this<00:03:01.840> is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
millions of laboratory animals this is
