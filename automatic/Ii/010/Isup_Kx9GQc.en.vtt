and lighter the screen grew ever so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550

four inches diagonally and the screen
shaper<00:01:09.900> aspect<00:01:10.290> ratio<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:10.979> changed<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
shaper aspect ratio was changed to a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
shaper aspect ratio was changed to a
wider<00:01:11.880> screen<00:01:12.210> much<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> movie<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
wider screen much more like a movie that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
wider screen much more like a movie that
may<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.030> great<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.659> videos<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.380> look

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
may be great for videos and they do look

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
may be great for videos and they do look
good<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.520> also<00:01:17.670> means<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> older<00:01:18.600> apps

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
good but it also means that older apps

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
good but it also means that older apps
have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> play<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.040> annoying<00:01:20.400> black<00:01:20.970> bars<00:01:21.360> on

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
have to play with annoying black bars on

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.090 
have to play with annoying black bars on
the<00:01:21.720> sides<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.170> fill<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> extra<00:01:22.590> space

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the sides to fill in the extra space

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
the sides to fill in the extra space
that's<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> change<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.780> those<00:01:24.930> apps

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that's going to change as those apps

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
that's going to change as those apps
eventually<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.799> updated<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> play<00:01:26.549> full

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
eventually or updated to play full
