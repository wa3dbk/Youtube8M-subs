 with ferrari they were going to ski this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.410
 It happened as we said in the Alps 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 French near one of their 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 residences at the mÃ©ribel station 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.780
 when he suffers a fall he hit the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.219
 head with a rock 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 Schumacher at the time of the accident 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.649
 He was wearing a helmet so he avoided a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.539
 fatal blow however it had to be 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.640
 transferred from emergency to hospital in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.949
 helicopter two hours later and despite 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 that the manager of the resort where 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.969
 he found the German said he was 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 conscious as we said and that his life 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.620
 I was not in danger when I was 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 attended at the medical center 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.300
 in a coma the first medical part 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 official at the grenoble hospital 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.500
 confirmed the seriousness of the pilot who 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.650
 had to be operated on in a way 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.470
 Immediate schumacher is 44 years old and 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.380
 I suffered from a severe head injury 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.600
 with a coma on arrival as we said to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.880
 this university hospital center 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.860
 from Greg Nott and several European media 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 have reported that he suffers a hemorrhage 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 brain that keeps your life in danger 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.580
 the fall of the legend of motorsport 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.010
 it happened around 11 in the morning 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.290
 local time and at the time of the accident 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.400
 he was accompanied by his 14 year old son 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.920
 although he was not involved in the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.120
 accident is to say more or less happened 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 will do 12 hours a half day more or less more 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.530
 or less so a time has passed 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.020
 important time to be able to have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.750
 a clear diagnosis maybe already what 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.790
 intervened yes I think so 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 sure as we have been reading the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 reports that it is understood that already 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 they intervened 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.470
 but now it must expect 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.900
 see how it evolves was not out of 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.940
 track is to say what I think of outside 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.860
 of track maybe with more speed more 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.310
 risky though he had a helmet out there 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.200
 the fall was very strong this is to say 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 off the track of hesse a very good 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 accurate skier who has five 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.740
 misplaced that go is not there as 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.840
 we said those rocks unforeseen things 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.390
 that normally if you go to a track 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.850
 which is already marked cleaner it is not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.850
 there are so many dangerous objects trees 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.080
 but you already know the first ones 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 news are many things are said and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680
 then they are changing so we're going to 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.010
 be very close following the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.750
 development of this news to show 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.570
 in the course of the hours for 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.500
 have it more recent and later on 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.500
 example thank you marcelo
