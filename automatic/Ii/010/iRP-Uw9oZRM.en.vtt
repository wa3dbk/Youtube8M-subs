we<00:00:12.690> were<00:00:12.780> definitely<00:00:12.929> like<00:00:13.290> striving<00:00:13.830> for

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
we were definitely like striving for

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.179 
we were definitely like striving for
like<00:00:14.129> a<00:00:14.160> larger-than-life<00:00:14.870> sound<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.529> you

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
like a larger-than-life sound and so you

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.130 
like a larger-than-life sound and so you
know<00:00:17.220> i<00:00:17.340> mean<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.640> recorded<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.509> tiny

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140

know i mean we recorded it in a tiny
Brooklyn<00:00:19.560> apartment<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.360> like<00:00:21.570> we

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Brooklyn apartment but it's like we

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.420 
Brooklyn apartment but it's like we
definitely<00:00:22.099> experimented<00:00:23.099> with<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> variety

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
definitely experimented with a variety

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
definitely experimented with a variety
of<00:00:23.730> textures<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.930> everything<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.590> make

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of textures and everything just to make

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.010 
of textures and everything just to make
it<00:00:26.310> sound<00:00:26.520> from<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.970> something<00:00:27.180> you

needs to be rescued if you look at the

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.189 
needs to be rescued if you look at the
the<00:00:46.949> cover<00:00:47.220> art<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.729> the<00:00:47.850> record<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.170> of

the cover art of the record it's kind of
a<00:00:49.290> stylized<00:00:50.269> vision<00:00:51.269> of<00:00:51.479> this<00:00:52.080> essentially

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
a stylized vision of this essentially

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.890 
a stylized vision of this essentially
which<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.220> somebody<00:00:54.089> helping

which is you know somebody helping

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.140 
which is you know somebody helping
somebody<00:00:55.290> else<00:00:55.650> out<00:00:55.860> basically<00:00:56.549> like<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
somebody else out basically like you

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.399 
somebody else out basically like you

then<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.640> branches<00:01:03.449> start<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
then the branches start this is how is I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.280 
then the branches start this is how is I
too<00:01:07.200> bad<00:01:08.119> we<00:01:09.119> wrote<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.930> while<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.200> were

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
too bad we wrote that one while we were

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.840 
too bad we wrote that one while we were
in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> studio<00:01:10.500> actually<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:11.670> some

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
in the studio actually we had some

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
in the studio actually we had some
downtime<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.049> producer<00:01:13.500> came<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.799> with

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
downtime and the producer came up with

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
downtime and the producer came up with
this<00:01:14.100> idea<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> went<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.810> my

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this idea and he and I went back to my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.710 
this idea and he and I went back to my
apartment<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.610> started<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.510> back

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and forth on some lyrics and it really

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.220

down<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.450> quick<00:01:24.750> rough<00:01:25.560> demo<00:01:25.980> which<00:01:26.190> was<00:01:26.370> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
down a quick rough demo which was just

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.410 
down a quick rough demo which was just
piano<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.390> voice<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.820> really

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.910 
impressed us all the piece and it just
ended<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.210> fitting<00:01:33.450> perfectly<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> end<00:01:34.710> of
