degree seat that's been installed and we

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
degree seat that's been installed and we
can<00:00:36.210> program<00:00:36.390> any<00:00:36.750> angles<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.350> radiuses<00:00:37.800> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
can program any angles or radiuses that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
can program any angles or radiuses that
we<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.360> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> basically<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> a

we want this is basically going to get a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.729 
we want this is basically going to get a
three<00:00:40.500> angle<00:00:40.800> valve<00:00:40.980> job<00:00:42.200> with<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> 60<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.710> the

three angle valve job with a 60 on the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.450 
three angle valve job with a 60 on the
bottom<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> 45<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.780> main<00:00:45.930> seat

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
bottom and then the 45 the main seat

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
bottom and then the 45 the main seat
finishing<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> 30<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> top<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
finishing off with the 30 on the top and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
finishing off with the 30 on the top and
we<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> profile<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> screen

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we can see the profile on the screen

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.560 
we can see the profile on the screen
which<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.440> what's<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.250> cut<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.000> we

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
which is what's going to be cut and we

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.040 
which is what's going to be cut and we
can<00:00:54.600> follow<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.199> profile<00:00:56.120> during<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.809> cut

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
can follow that profile during the cut

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
can follow that profile during the cut
as<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.559> cutting<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> path<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
as it's cutting we can see the path of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.830 
as it's cutting we can see the path of
the<00:01:00.780> tool<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.170> live<00:01:02.390> once<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> start<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the tool that live once I start the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.740 
the tool that live once I start the
process<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:05.670> stop<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> now

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
process so I'll stop that now

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.010 
process so I'll stop that now
and<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> watch<00:01:08.189> both<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> tool<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> on

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and we can watch both at the tool and on

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.000 
and we can watch both at the tool and on
the<00:01:10.200> screen<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.750> mimics<00:01:12.750> what's

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the screen which will just mimics what's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:22.580 
the screen which will just mimics what's
happening<00:01:14.010> live<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.119> there<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.600> go

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.650 

basically<00:01:23.340> does<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.580> ruff<00:01:24.000> cycle<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.540> then

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
basically does the ruff cycle and then

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.680 
basically does the ruff cycle and then
finishes<00:01:25.110> off<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.760> finished<00:01:27.120> pass<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
finishes off with a finished pass and

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.380 
finishes off with a finished pass and
that<00:01:28.230> completes<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.330> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that completes the see it's just a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.460 
that completes the see it's just a
matter<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:31.130> seconds<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.430> application

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
matter of seconds for application

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
matter of seconds for application
depending<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.620> size<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> seat

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
depending on the size of the seat

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.590 
depending on the size of the seat
excuse<00:01:36.300> me<00:01:36.450> less<00:01:36.630> than<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> minute

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:56.360 

and<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.440> finish<00:01:46.740> pass
