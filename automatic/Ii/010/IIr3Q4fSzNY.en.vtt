00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi guys Robotnik's here and this is just
a<00:00:03.030> quick<00:00:03.210> showcase<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> medieval<00:00:04.350> dock

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
a quick showcase for a medieval dock

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.210 
a quick showcase for a medieval dock
house<00:00:05.480> now<00:00:06.480> like<00:00:06.660> all<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:06.930> builds<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.649> try<00:00:08.160> to

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
house now like all my builds I try to

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820 
house now like all my builds I try to
have<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> good<00:00:09.000> variation<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:09.960> materials<00:00:10.559> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
have a good variation in materials so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.730 
have a good variation in materials so
again<00:00:11.340> I've<00:00:11.849> used<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.420> stone<00:00:12.780> bricks<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
again I've used the stone bricks and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
again I've used the stone bricks and
cobblestone<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> lower<00:00:14.730> floors<00:00:15.260> wattle

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
cobblestone for the lower floors wattle

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
cobblestone for the lower floors wattle
and<00:00:16.320> daub<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.830> wood<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> upper<00:00:17.910> floors

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and daub and wood for the upper floors

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.189 
and daub and wood for the upper floors
with<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.010> cobblestone<00:00:20.010> roof<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.869> think

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
with a cobblestone roof and I think

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.810 
with a cobblestone roof and I think
biggest<00:00:22.650> feature<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
biggest feature of this that I like is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269 
biggest feature of this that I like is
the<00:00:23.970> overhang<00:00:24.420> again<00:00:25.380> I've<00:00:25.500> used<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.949> re

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the overhang again I've used the re

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
the overhang again I've used the re
textured<00:00:26.730> nether<00:00:26.910> brick<00:00:27.060> stairs<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
textured nether brick stairs here to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.460 
textured nether brick stairs here to
achieve<00:00:29.279> sort<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> diagonal<00:00:30.359> things<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
achieve sort of diagonal things and I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
achieve sort of diagonal things and I
think<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.800> gives<00:00:32.009> quite<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> good<00:00:32.489> effect

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
think that gives quite a good effect

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.120 
think that gives quite a good effect
just<00:00:33.059> makes<00:00:33.270> Harbor<00:00:34.230> wall<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:34.980> more

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
just makes Harbor wall look a bit more

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
just makes Harbor wall look a bit more
interesting<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.630> obviously<00:00:37.020> where

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
interesting and this is obviously where

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
interesting and this is obviously where
the<00:00:37.260> cargo<00:00:38.010> would<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> brought<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the cargo would be brought in from the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
the cargo would be brought in from the
air<00:00:39.300> from<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> wall<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> ship's<00:00:40.320> they

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
air from the wall from the ship's they

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
air from the wall from the ship's they
stored<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.180> quite<00:00:42.420> nice<00:00:42.600> big<00:00:42.840> cargo

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
obviously the wharf where the ships

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
just make from fence posts which allow

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
just make from fence posts which allow
cargo<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> load<00:00:56.190> kids<00:00:56.430> carts

happy this is quite a simple build I
haven't<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.899> done<00:01:04.080> too<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.799> far<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
haven't really done too much so far to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.289 
haven't really done too much so far to
sort<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:06.979> Judge<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.790> with

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sort of Judge it up a little bit with

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
sort of Judge it up a little bit with
extra<00:01:09.600> details<00:01:09.990> I've<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.310> bare

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
extra details I've just kind of the bare

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
extra details I've just kind of the bare
bones<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.570> quite<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bones but I think that's quite good to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
bones but I think that's quite good to
sort<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> showing<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> guys<00:01:14.930> showing<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
guys the basics of how its put together

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.920 
guys the basics of how its put together
we<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.290> inside<00:01:20.060> again<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.299> quite<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> sort<00:01:21.900> of
