the gameplay is starting now and as you
can<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.299> sprain<00:01:33.810> guys<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> says<00:01:34.409> he<00:01:34.560> has

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
can see on sprain guys it says he has

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
can see on sprain guys it says he has
heroic<00:01:35.189> fists<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.210> guessing<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
heroic fists now I'm guessing this is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.890 
heroic fists now I'm guessing this is
amy<00:01:37.770> leigh<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.369> he<00:01:38.460> also<00:01:38.579> has<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.150> heroic<00:01:39.390> thing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
amy leigh but he also has a heroic thing

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
amy leigh but he also has a heroic thing
which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.259> infinite<00:01:41.009> ammo<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.909> he<00:01:42.030> has<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
which is infinite ammo so he has to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.440 
which is infinite ammo so he has to
pretty<00:01:43.200> much<00:01:43.380> primary<00:01:43.950> weapons<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.149> i

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pretty much primary weapons there so i

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
pretty much primary weapons there so i
