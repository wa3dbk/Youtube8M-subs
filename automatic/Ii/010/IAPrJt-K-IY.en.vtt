00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.240
 let's see how to change 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.740
 locations of our machine 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.800
 brothers cana in cat 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.320
 we are on the main screen we go 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.350
 to press the know button with the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.629
 key 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.129
 as you can see there opens a window in 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.800
 to which we have all our varieties 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.300
 Settings start from the first 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 first setting we have e 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 setting the language by clicking on 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.809
 work tools we can go 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.470
 change the writing language to 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.820
 in this case we keep the Italian 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.530
 we have the possibility to vary 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.360
 the unit of measurement from mm to inches 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.860
 we can go and vary what it is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.330
 the cutting area 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.119
 let's always click on the tools 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.280
 from work to see the two possibilities 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.650
 we have the first possibility than that 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 with 12 inch cutting air for 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.150
 12 inches which are approximately 30 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 centimeters 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.680
 clicking on this button we pass 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.890
 to the next Italian version that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.009
 the one of the double top then a 30 x 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.630
 60 cm this cutting plane is not in 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.010
 equipped with the car but is a 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.540
 additional accessory that is possible 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 buy it later 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 let's go back we have the possibility 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.990
 to set a background color 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.400
 therefore light or dark or of 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.580
 turn it off 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.260
 we drain with the arrows we can go to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.979
 vary what is the speed of 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.870
 cutting the cutting pressure la 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.840
 drawing speed and the pressure of the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.110
 I design what I can recommend 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.340
 go and change these parameters 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.830
 only by following the guide you find 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.629
 inside the machine then a 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.150
 depending on the type of material it is 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.040
 went to use you go changed 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 the speed the cutting pressure for 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.390
 avoid cutting the floor below 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.220
 as a greater pressure risks 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.750
 to go and ruin the plan of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.640
 support 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.220
 we go down again with the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.049
 darts we have automatic shutdown 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.359
 we can set the machine so 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.140
 that turns off automatically after 1 hour 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:38.720
 2 hours and 3 hours we have the possibility of 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.720
 activate or deactivate the citizen 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.430
 when we go to press the margins of 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.010
 stitching them again 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.269
 we can therefore increase a quarter of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.260
 inch half inch 5 octaves 3 mm 5 mm 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.150
 7 mm or one centimeter the interval 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 of the drawings and the last settings that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.689
 we can go and change that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.180
 then on the initial startup screen 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.340
 the one with the scan and cut animation that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.069
 we can decide whether to activate it or 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.260
 turn it off these are the settings 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.840
 of the car we can go to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 edit in the next video vi 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.319
 I will show the various folders with 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.790
 subcategories of drawings already 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.790
 available on the machine
