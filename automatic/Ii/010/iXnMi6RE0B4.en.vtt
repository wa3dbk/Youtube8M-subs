00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.388
 "Which spice works against inflammation?" 

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:10.917
 Once in a while I come across a study that's so interesting 

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:12.803
 that I will make a whole video about her. 

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:17.084
 An example is my video "Which fruit works against cancer best" 

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.518
 or "Best Cooking Methods" 

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.876
 possibly a video of this study that compared thousands of foods. 

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.357
 Even now I have one special. 

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.000
 A group of scientists from the University of Florida in Gainesville and Pennsylvania State University 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 created a sophisticated scientific experiment. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.575
 We know for some time that they have their weight 

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:36.303
 herbs and spices one of the strongest 

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.726
 antioxidant activities we know. However, the experiments were carried out in a tube. 

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:43.183
 Before we can ask whether the herb or spice has health benefits, 

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:46.544
 it is first necessary to determine whether the substances are bioavailable at all. 

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.583
 This was a recent study. 

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.457
 They could have made it easy, 

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:55.663
 simply measure the change in antioxidant levels 

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:58.183
 in the blood before and after consumption of spices. 

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.102
 But the assumption that antioxidant activity 

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.556
 Blood is an indicator of the bioavailability of antioxidants has its weakness. 

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.275
 Maybe more is absorbed than we think 

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.474
 but they do not show up in antioxidant tests 

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.406
 because they bind to proteins or cells. 

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.018
 Therefore, they tried to measure rather 

00:01:13.018 --> 00:01:15.586
 physiological changes in the blood. 

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:18.430
 They were wondering if the absorbed compounds could 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.303
 to protect white blood cells 

00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:22.622
 against oxidative or inflammatory damage. 

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:25.215
 They wanted to find out if they would protect the DNA chains 

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:27.943
 before disintegration after contact with free radicals. 

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.742
 They are also wondering if eating herbs 

00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:33.741
 and spice could affect cellular inflammatory responses 

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.744
 on exposure 

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:37.502
 significant inflammatory damage. 

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:39.223
 What does it all mean? 

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.850
 They chose a group of people and each one of them 

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.380
 they were tasked with eating 

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:45.170
 some kind of spice for one week. 

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.860
 There are many unique elements in this study, 

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.500
 One is that the amount consumed 

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:56.660
 the spice corresponded to the normal amount contained in the actual meals. 

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:00.060
 For example, an oregano group received half a teaspoon a day. 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.380
 Thus, the dosage is moderate, 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.140
 the same amount people sometimes give to food. 

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.020
 They took blood at the end of the week 

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:09.460
 about a dozen people 

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.420
 who added black pepper to their meals during the week 

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.020
 and compared the effects of their blood 

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:16.060
 with the blood of another dozen people 

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:18.760
 consuming kayan pepper, cinnamon, cloves or Roman cumin. 

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.780
 They had about 10 different groups of people 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.360
 who ate about 10 different kinds of spices. 

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.340
 Then they dripped their plasma 

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.020
 (liquid part of blood) 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.540
 on human white blood cells placed in a petri dish. 

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.850
 These cells were exposed to inflammatory damage. 

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.580
 They wanted to choose something really inflammatory, 

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:35.860
 therefore selected oxidized cholesterol. 

00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:38.530
 He gets into the bloodstream 

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:40.870
 for example, after eating a fried chicken. 

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:43.120
 Thus, white blood cells were exposed 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 oxidized cholesterol and then measured 

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.820
 how much TNF creates in response. 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.500
 Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine 

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:56.020
 infamous for his role in autoimmune attacks on the body, 

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.480
 for example in chronic intestinal inflammation. 

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.460
 They found a difference in comparing the blood of those 

00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:01.220
 who didn't eat any spices for a week 

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:03.860
 with those who ate black pepper? 

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:07.270
 Was pepper able to ease the inflammatory response? 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630
 He couldn't. 

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.860
 What about other kinds of spices? 

00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:17.340
 Cloves, ginger, rosemary and turmeric 

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:21.980
 significantly suppress the inflammatory response. 

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:25.970
 Remember that on human white blood cells 

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.340
 they did not drip spices directly, but the blood of people 

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:29.580
 who ate this spice. 

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.420
 Therefore, the results may correspond to the actual situation 

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:33.860
 in our body when our cells are exposed to a lot of spices 

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:38.090
 flowing in the blood after eating normal daily doses of these spices. 

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:40.420
 They didn't use huge doses in pills, 

00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:44.100
 use the same amount as you would taste a spaghetti sauce, 

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.910
 pumpkin pie or curry sauce. 

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:49.980
 There are drugs that can do the same. 

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:53.620
 Tumor necrosis factors are such major mediators 

00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:56.540
 inflammation and inflammation-related diseases. 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.280
 Therefore, there are substances that suppress TNF. 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.140
 These drugs are used to treat inflammatory diseases, 

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:04.830
 for example, osteoarthritis, chronic intestinal inflammation, 

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.540
 psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. 

00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:12.540
 Together, these medicines carry over $ 20 billion a year 

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:15.260
 because the pharmaceutical company people 

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:20.210
 they charge for an annual treatment of this type from 340,000 to 450,000 CZK. 

00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:24.900
 Given such a high price, I would hope that side effects will be hugs and rainbows. 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.180
 But that's not the case, these drugs carry a warning in a black box, 

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.060
 because they can cause for example 

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.790
 cancer and heart failure. 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.300
 If there were a cheaper and safer solution. 

00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:40.240
 Curcumin, yellow turmeric dye 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.310
 that is, a spice that is cheaper and safer than such a medicine. 

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:46.500
 But does it work outside the tube? 

00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:49.660
 There is evidence that it can help with all diseases, 

00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:52.180
 in which TNF blockers are currently used. 

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:55.580
 Given that the price of healthcare and its safety are important elements, 

00:04:55.584 --> 00:05:04.240
 Gold Turmeric can help us find a solution for this situation.
