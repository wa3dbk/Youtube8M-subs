red it was actually it's not that
difficult<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:21.079> scratch<00:01:21.380> off<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:21.709> I<00:01:21.799> said<00:01:22.009> if

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
difficult to scratch off as I said if

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.589 
difficult to scratch off as I said if
you<00:01:22.189> because<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.880> numerous<00:01:23.240> layers<00:01:23.420> of

00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:23.599 
you because of the numerous layers of

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.239 
you because of the numerous layers of
varnish<00:01:23.749> I<00:01:24.049> applied<00:01:24.380> during<00:01:24.679> my<00:01:24.799> paint<00:01:25.039> jobs

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
varnish I applied during my paint jobs

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.989 
varnish I applied during my paint jobs
and<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:26.630> know<00:01:26.749> if<00:01:27.499> I<00:01:27.649> get<00:01:27.889> something<00:01:28.609> on<00:01:28.729> a

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
and you know if I get something on a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:30.550 
and you know if I get something on a
layer<00:01:29.240> don't<00:01:29.509> want<00:01:29.719> I<00:01:29.840> can<00:01:30.020> pretty<00:01:30.259> much<00:01:30.349> to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
layer don't want I can pretty much to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.989 
layer don't want I can pretty much to
scratch<00:01:30.770> off<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.159> cocktail<00:01:31.340> stick<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:31.880> I'm

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
scratch off with a cocktail stick if I'm

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.269 
scratch off with a cocktail stick if I'm
careful<00:01:32.209> and<00:01:32.509> it's<00:01:33.439> have<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.649> do<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.919> in<00:01:34.130> a

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
careful and it's have to do that in a

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.899 
careful and it's have to do that in a
few<00:01:34.459> places

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
few places

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.589 
few places
um<00:01:36.249> but<00:01:37.249> yeah<00:01:37.429> so<00:01:37.669> this<00:01:37.789> is<00:01:37.849> it<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.299> how<00:01:38.569> it

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:38.599 
um but yeah so this is it this is how it

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.599 
um but yeah so this is it this is how it
looks<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.020> far<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.649> looks<00:01:39.679> pretty<00:01:40.099> good<00:01:40.340> this

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
looks so far it looks pretty good this

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.330 
looks so far it looks pretty good this
is<00:01:40.729> kind<00:01:40.909> of<00:01:40.969> like<00:01:41.179> almost<00:01:42.189> cel-shaded<00:01:43.189> like<00:01:43.310> a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
is kind of like almost cel-shaded like a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.389 
is kind of like almost cel-shaded like a
cartoon<00:01:43.909> version<00:01:44.179> of<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.719> dreadnought<00:01:45.349> and<00:01:46.039> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
cartoon version of a dreadnought and I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.279 
cartoon version of a dreadnought and I
only<00:01:46.639> just<00:01:46.729> donned<00:01:47.119> them<00:01:47.270> he<00:01:47.419> kind<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.810> reminds

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
only just donned them he kind of reminds

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.169 
only just donned them he kind of reminds
me<00:01:48.349> of<00:01:48.439> Optimus<00:01:48.859> Prime<00:01:49.099> I<00:01:49.369> think<00:01:49.909> that's<00:01:50.060> just

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
me of Optimus Prime I think that's just

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.940 
me of Optimus Prime I think that's just
the<00:01:50.329> color<00:01:50.509> scheme<00:01:50.749> I<00:01:50.929> was<00:01:51.229> almost<00:01:51.349> tempted<00:01:51.679> to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.690 
you've just got it you just got to be
patient<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:00.770> at<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.070> end<00:04:01.100> result<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.580> get

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
patient but at the end result you get

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.180 
patient but at the end result you get
like<00:04:01.970> super<00:04:02.180> smooth<00:04:02.660> super<00:04:02.930> smooth<00:04:03.770> colors

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
like super smooth super smooth colors

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.480 
like super smooth super smooth colors
and<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:07.010> relatively

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
and and it you know it's relatively

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.060 
and and it you know it's relatively
quick<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.360> know<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.900> each<00:04:09.410> strokes<00:04:09.740> usually

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
quick you know it each strokes usually

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.340 
quick you know it each strokes usually
dry<00:04:10.280> before<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:11.450> know<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.630> go<00:04:11.959> back<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
dry before you know you go back to the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.020 
dry before you know you go back to the
area<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.820> next<00:04:13.970> next<00:04:14.480> coat<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:16.130> yeah

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
area and do the next next coat and yeah

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.750 
area and do the next next coat and yeah
so<00:04:17.329> that's<00:04:17.709> that's<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.400> haven't<00:04:19.579> done<00:04:19.669> the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so that's that's that I haven't done the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.610 
so that's that's that I haven't done the
base<00:04:19.940> I'll<00:04:20.209> do<00:04:20.359> all<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.540> base<00:04:20.690> later<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.410> I

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
base I'll do all the base later and I

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.490 
base I'll do all the base later and I
tend<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:21.950> then<00:04:22.130> last<00:04:22.370> but<00:04:22.960> yeah<00:04:23.960> that's

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
tend to do then last but yeah that's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.130 
tend to do then last but yeah that's
what<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.860> looks<00:04:25.010> like<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.430> far

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
what it looks like so far

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.409 
what it looks like so far
big<00:04:27.140> step<00:04:27.410> up<00:04:27.560> from<00:04:27.740> before<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.880> also<00:04:29.150> did<00:04:29.390> a

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
big step up from before and I also did a

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.380 
big step up from before and I also did a
quick<00:04:30.130> another<00:04:31.130> satin<00:04:31.550> varnish<00:04:31.730> over<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> top

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
quick another satin varnish over the top

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.150 
quick another satin varnish over the top
of<00:04:32.419> this<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.750> protect<00:04:32.870> this<00:04:33.200> work<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:33.980> if<00:04:34.040> I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
of this to protect this work so if I

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.830 
of this to protect this work so if I
make<00:04:34.310> mistakes<00:04:34.640> mistakes<00:04:35.030> on<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.480> next<00:04:35.690> stage

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
make mistakes mistakes on the next stage

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.500 
make mistakes mistakes on the next stage
would<00:04:36.020> be<00:04:36.080> easy<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:37.160> correct<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:38.300> as<00:04:38.479> a

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
would be easy to to correct but as a

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.719 
would be easy to to correct but as a
result<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.229> if<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.950> spray<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:40.430> anything

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
result and if you spray it like anything

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.190 
result and if you spray it like anything
other<00:04:41.150> than<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.419> gloss<00:04:41.630> varnish<00:04:41.840> over

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
other than a gloss varnish over

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.560 
other than a gloss varnish over
metallics<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.040> kind<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.370> dulls<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.970> metallic

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
metallics it kind of dulls the metallic

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.690 
metallics it kind of dulls the metallic
effects<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.350> sheen<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:46.130> metal<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.580> it

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
effects so the sheen on this metal of it

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.030 
effects so the sheen on this metal of it
you<00:04:47.300> know<00:04:47.419> it's<00:04:47.540> not<00:04:47.720> I'd<00:04:48.290> imagine<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:48.919> I

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
you know it's not I'd imagine that if I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.830 
you know it's not I'd imagine that if I
was<00:04:49.160> doing<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.460> when<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.850> wasn't<00:04:50.210> varnished

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
was doing this when it wasn't varnished

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.290 
was doing this when it wasn't varnished
it<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.350> reflectivity<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.490> metal<00:04:53.180> would

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
it the reflectivity of the metal would

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.420 
it the reflectivity of the metal would
be<00:04:53.479> sort<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.750> blinding<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.290> camera<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.650> bit<00:04:54.830> but

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
be sort of blinding the camera a bit but

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.230 
be sort of blinding the camera a bit but
um<00:04:56.500> no<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.680> kind<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.130> it's<00:04:58.550> dog<00:04:58.790> Lee<00:04:59.030> Bob

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
um no it's kind of a it's dog Lee Bob

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.150 
um no it's kind of a it's dog Lee Bob
and<00:04:59.510> Donna<00:04:59.690> bit<00:04:59.900> which<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.050> fine<00:05:00.350> that<00:05:00.560> it's

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and Donna bit which is fine that it's

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.440 
and Donna bit which is fine that it's
just<00:05:01.370> fine<00:05:01.520> I<00:05:01.550> mean<00:05:01.820> it's<00:05:01.940> kind<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
just fine I mean it's kind of like the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.570 
just fine I mean it's kind of like the
effect<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.870> wanted<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:03.740> when<00:05:04.010> we<00:05:04.100> get<00:05:04.220> around<00:05:04.310> to

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
effect I wanted so when we get around to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.890 
effect I wanted so when we get around to
shading<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.270> then<00:05:05.360> highlighting<00:05:05.840> that

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
shading it and then highlighting that

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.420 
shading it and then highlighting that
the<00:05:06.020> highlights<00:05:06.350> will<00:05:06.470> really<00:05:06.860> pop<00:05:07.070> on<00:05:07.340> the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
the highlights will really pop on the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.100 
the highlights will really pop on the
metal<00:05:07.700> where<00:05:08.240> it's<00:05:08.360> all<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.570> shadows<00:05:08.900> between

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
metal where it's all the shadows between

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.879 
metal where it's all the shadows between
almost<00:05:09.740> matter

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
almost matter

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.850 
almost matter
I'm<00:05:11.330> black<00:05:12.330> or<00:05:12.539> something<00:05:12.810> like<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.259> they

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
I'm black or something like that so they

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.379 
I'm black or something like that so they
look<00:05:14.069> really<00:05:14.099> really<00:05:14.430> cool<00:05:14.789> I<00:05:14.819> think<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.210> suits

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
look really really cool I think it suits

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.779 
look really really cool I think it suits
the<00:05:15.629> air<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.960> Dreadnought<00:05:16.289> well<00:05:16.439> so<00:05:16.789> stay

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
the air the Dreadnought well so stay

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.300 
the air the Dreadnought well so stay
tuned<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.599> I'll<00:05:19.349> probably<00:05:19.529> do<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.129> next

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
tuned and I'll probably do the next

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.670 
tuned and I'll probably do the next
tutorial<00:05:21.029> and<00:05:21.569> I'll<00:05:22.110> probably<00:05:22.289> film<00:05:22.529> it

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
tutorial and I'll probably film it

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.059
