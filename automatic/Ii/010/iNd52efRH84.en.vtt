the back which is as per usual in these
types<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> design<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
types of design but a good thing is that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.189 
types of design but a good thing is that
the<00:01:01.320> head<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.890> completely<00:01:02.780> concealed<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the head is completely concealed and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.609 
the head is completely concealed and
it's<00:01:04.949> very<00:01:05.369> solid<00:01:06.860> no<00:01:07.860> rattles<00:01:08.490> just

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
it's very solid no rattles just

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.310 
it's very solid no rattles just
everything<00:01:10.619> fits<00:01:10.860> together<00:01:10.950> perfectly

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
everything fits together perfectly

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
everything fits together perfectly
no<00:01:13.320> sloppiness<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.610> course<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
no sloppiness here of course it is a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.899 
no sloppiness here of course it is a
parts<00:01:15.659> former<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> benefit<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
parts former but that's the benefit of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
parts former but that's the benefit of
being<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.360> parts<00:01:18.689> former<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.680> complain<00:01:22.220> in

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
being a parts former don't complain in

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270 
being a parts former don't complain in
general<00:01:23.670> yes<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.380> jet<00:01:25.740> mode<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
general yes I like the jet mode and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.080 
general yes I like the jet mode and
these<00:01:27.680> missiles<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> front<00:01:29.520> hull<00:01:29.759> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
these missiles are the front hull very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
these missiles are the front hull very
nice<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.979> beam<00:01:32.159> weapon

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
nice and there's a kind of beam weapon

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.289 
nice and there's a kind of beam weapon
on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> nose<00:01:33.270> cone<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:35.460> underslung

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
on the nose cone and this underslung

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
on the nose cone and this underslung
being<00:01:37.229> rifle<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.900> also<00:01:39.900> rather<00:01:40.500> fetching

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
being rifle is also rather fetching

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.780 
being rifle is also rather fetching
mounting<00:01:41.970> points<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> under<00:01:44.579> each

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
mounting points here in the under each

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.569 
mounting points here in the under each
wing<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.710> have<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.979> either<00:01:47.220> left

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
wing so you can have it on either left

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.810 
wing so you can have it on either left
or<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.570> nice<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.960> had<00:01:49.200> two

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
or right it would be nice if we had two

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
or right it would be nice if we had two
one<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.939> each<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.170> actual<00:01:52.500> fact<00:01:52.680> what

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
one on each side and in actual fact what

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649 
one on each side and in actual fact what
I<00:01:52.890> found<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.090> point<00:01:54.360> here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
I found was that at this point here

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
I found was that at this point here
which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.790> under<00:01:56.790> its<00:01:57.780> belly<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
which is just under its belly there is a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.410 
which is just under its belly there is a
slot<00:02:00.390> where<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.110> mount<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> cannon

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
slot where you can mount the cannon

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
slot where you can mount the cannon
okay<00:02:03.420> yes<00:02:03.719> gain<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.439> symmetry<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:07.429> we<00:02:08.429> would

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
okay yes gain some symmetry but we would

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.170 
okay yes gain some symmetry but we would
have<00:02:08.670> rather<00:02:09.239> had<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> lower<00:02:10.649> down<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
have rather had it lower down and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.830 
have rather had it lower down and
further<00:02:13.180> forward<00:02:14.069> that's<00:02:15.069> just<00:02:15.250> my<00:02:15.340> taste<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
further forward that's just my taste and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
further forward that's just my taste and
I<00:02:17.650> think<00:02:17.769> that's<00:02:18.099> about<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.610> his<00:02:18.700> jet<00:02:19.030> mode

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I think that's about it for his jet mode

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.080 
I think that's about it for his jet mode
yeah<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.690> very<00:02:19.870> good<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:21.459> doesn't<00:02:21.610> look<00:02:21.730> like

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
yeah it's very good it doesn't look like

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.479 
yeah it's very good it doesn't look like
a<00:02:22.659> robot<00:02:24.269> pretending<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> jet<00:02:27.930> well

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
a robot pretending to be a jet well

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.520 
a robot pretending to be a jet well
unless<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.640> were<00:02:30.730> really<00:02:30.940> looking<00:02:31.420> hard<00:02:32.760> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
unless you were really looking hard so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.649 
unless you were really looking hard so
his<00:02:35.530> robot<00:02:36.129> mode<00:02:36.159> or<00:02:36.610> mobile<00:02:36.879> suit<00:02:37.239> mode<00:02:37.480> if

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
his robot mode or mobile suit mode if

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.380 
his robot mode or mobile suit mode if
you<00:02:37.690> must<00:02:38.790> yes<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:41.829> get<00:02:41.980> lots<00:02:42.159> of<00:02:42.370> bits<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you must yes to get lots of bits and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:03:00.410

and<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:53.130> would<00:05:53.700> have<00:05:53.820> expected<00:05:54.360> him<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:55.250> have

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
and I would have expected him to have

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.190 
and I would have expected him to have
been<00:05:56.610> brought<00:05:56.970> out<00:05:57.030> sometime<00:05:57.780> in<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.020> future

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
been brought out sometime in the future

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.060 
been brought out sometime in the future
in<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.680> chrome-plated<00:05:59.660> edition<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.950> know

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
in a chrome-plated edition to you know

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.460 
in a chrome-plated edition to you know
celebrate<00:06:02.790> that<00:06:03.000> fact<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.900> positioning

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
celebrate that fact but the positioning

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.800 
celebrate that fact but the positioning
of<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.650> gates<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:05.490> quite<00:06:05.790> clear<00:06:06.090> that<00:06:06.120> is

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
of the gates it's quite clear that is

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.600 
of the gates it's quite clear that is
gonna<00:06:06.990> be<00:06:07.170> nasty<00:06:07.410> if<00:06:07.710> they<00:06:07.830> chrome<00:06:08.130> plate<00:06:08.370> it

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
gonna be nasty if they chrome plate it

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.950 
gonna be nasty if they chrome plate it
it's<00:06:08.820> probably<00:06:08.940> not<00:06:09.120> gonna<00:06:09.300> stop<00:06:09.660> them<00:06:09.930> from

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
it's probably not gonna stop them from

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.630 
it's probably not gonna stop them from
chrome<00:06:10.440> plating<00:06:10.920> it<00:06:11.010> but<00:06:11.190> I<00:06:11.430> certainly

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
chrome plating it but I certainly

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.680 
chrome plating it but I certainly
wouldn't<00:06:12.120> buy<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:16.070> so<00:06:17.070> if<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.430> like

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
wouldn't buy it so if you like

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.930 
wouldn't buy it so if you like
transforming<00:06:18.690> mobile<00:06:19.560> suits<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:20.130> think<00:06:20.790> this

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
transforming mobile suits I think this

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.940 
transforming mobile suits I think this
is<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.150> not<00:06:22.140> bad<00:06:22.410> choice<00:06:24.620> certainly<00:06:25.620> looking

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
is a not bad choice certainly looking

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.530 
is a not bad choice certainly looking

forward to building the Rahzel I went

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.629 
forward to building the Rahzel I went

normal version because that one had a
