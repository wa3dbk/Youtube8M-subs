 disappearing oranges in blue is a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.770
 flash and reappearance in orange is a 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.020
 trace we have 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 as power as or take out to teach 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.210
 different types of airbus at the time 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.860

 of all the colors that we can 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.670
 imagine there are millions of colors then 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.250
 have finally added boys trolley with 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.229
 tnt here we have our bat and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.789
 I fluttering this that the truth is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.509
 It's not like I'm going to look at it right now 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.459
 is a daylight sensor guys then 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.640
 we also have a welder that what 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.410
 it was called if welder I do not know why 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.330
 it works true then we have a block 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.450
 iron and gold 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.160
 as it was called a funnel I think that in the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.260
 computer was called tool ball or something 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.300

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.820
 new network repeaters are but now 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.200
 of three so it's kind of weird the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.240
 true now instead of moving the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.890
