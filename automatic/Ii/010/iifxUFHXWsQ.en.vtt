can do with this game and it's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
can do with this game and it's
definitely<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:47.970> direction<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.630> anything

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
definitely a good direction if anything

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
definitely a good direction if anything
I'm<00:01:49.290> disappointed<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.250> didn't<00:01:50.579> start

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
I'm disappointed that they didn't start

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
I'm disappointed that they didn't start
this<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> ritual<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.200> mash<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.649> because

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this with the ritual and mash up because

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.289 
this with the ritual and mash up because
I'm<00:01:53.220> voice<00:01:53.399> acting<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.240> been

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I'm voice acting there would have been

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
I'm voice acting there would have been
very<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.810> especially<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> was

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
very nice especially because it was

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.030 
very nice especially because it was
dialogue<00:01:56.579> heavy<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> yet<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.770> would

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
dialogue heavy and and yet it just would

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.740 
dialogue heavy and and yet it just would
have<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.430> much<00:01:59.460> cooler<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.180> uh<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.570> it's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
have been so much cooler but uh but it's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
have been so much cooler but uh but it's
a<00:02:00.840> shame<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.340> least<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.610> finally

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
a shame and but at least they finally

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.789 
a shame and but at least they finally
done<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> let's<00:02:04.110> hope<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.350> all<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
done it and let's hope that all the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
done it and let's hope that all the
quests<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> future<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.630> even

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
quests in the future and you know even

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.469

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
normal content come with Vice voice

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140 
normal content come with Vice voice
dialogues<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.009> who<00:02:11.129> knows<00:02:11.310> maybe<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
dialogues and and who knows maybe if I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150 
dialogues and and who knows maybe if I
could

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
could

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.190 
could
I could<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:13.730> presumptuous<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.570> be<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.900> so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
I could be so presumptuous and be of so

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800 
I could be so presumptuous and be of so
optimistic<00:02:15.980> perhaps<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.120> could<00:02:17.180> redo<00:02:17.540> all

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
optimistic perhaps they could redo all

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.930 
optimistic perhaps they could redo all
the<00:02:17.990> dialogue<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> entire<00:02:18.980> game<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.550> mean<00:02:19.850> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the dialogue in the entire game I mean I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.550 
the dialogue in the entire game I mean I
think<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.420> probably<00:02:20.630> take<00:02:20.960> quite<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.290> bit<00:02:21.500> of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
think that probably take quite a bit of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770 
think that probably take quite a bit of
money<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:22.100> time<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:22.610> uh<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.390> that's<00:02:23.540> probably

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
money in time but uh so that's probably

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.700 
money in time but uh so that's probably
something<00:02:24.020> that's<00:02:24.260> never<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.650> happen

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
something that's never going to happen

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.030 
something that's never going to happen
but<00:02:25.130> hey<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.490> can<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.330> dream<00:02:26.620> anyway<00:02:27.620> thanks
