champion rework under gameplay so this

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.580

gravity<00:01:18.180> augments<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:19.020> likely<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.619> reworked

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
gravity augments will likely be reworked

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
gravity augments will likely be reworked
some<00:01:20.610> degree<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.390> definitely<00:01:21.630> should<00:01:22.020> be

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
some degree and it definitely should be

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
some degree and it definitely should be
so<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.340> changes<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> longer

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so any changes will have a longer

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
so any changes will have a longer
development<00:01:25.110> period<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> numbers<00:01:26.460> week

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
development period than the numbers week

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
development period than the numbers week
due<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.780> any<00:01:28.110> updates<00:01:28.560> likely<00:01:29.070> won't<00:01:29.310> be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
due to that any updates likely won't be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.179 
due to that any updates likely won't be
finished<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.119> while<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.860> then<00:01:31.860> here's<00:01:32.130> the

see Xin Zhao reworked we should be

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
see Xin Zhao reworked we should be
expecting<00:01:55.399> Victor<00:01:56.399> they're<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.729> really

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
expecting Victor they're not really

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.550 
expecting Victor they're not really
telling<00:01:57.210> us<00:01:57.390> yet<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.259> supposed<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
telling us yet what we're supposed to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.440 
telling us yet what we're supposed to
expect<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:00.030> realistically<00:02:01.159> it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
expect from it because realistically it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
he's not that close to be coming out yet
really<00:02:06.180> what<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.229> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
