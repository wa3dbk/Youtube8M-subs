00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Today I want to present you our wooden tree shelf.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
It is available in different versions. 
Here we see it in the large version.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It has separate shelves, so it 
is freely suspended from the wall. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's what makes the special 
charm of this big wall version.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I will show it to you, 
as I take out a few wood.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Here you see the construction.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The separated shelves have side panels
which are folded upwards.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
As you can see, the shelves
have a stop at the rear.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
This prevents staining the wall.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Each shelf has 10 kg load capacity. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Wherein the large shelf, we have a total load 
capacity of 140 kg, which the shelf supports.
