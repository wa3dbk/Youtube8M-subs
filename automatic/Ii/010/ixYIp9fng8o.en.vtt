season<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.880> basically<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> thought<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
season so basically I thought this was a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
season so basically I thought this was a
creative<00:00:26.130> idea<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.849> other<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.090> do

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
creative idea right so other people do

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
creative idea right so other people do
it<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> past<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> decided<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it in the past so I decided to do it so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.919 
it in the past so I decided to do it so
basically<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.029> didn't<00:00:30.359> want<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> lot<00:00:30.720> like

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
basically I didn't want a lot like

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
basically I didn't want a lot like

to<00:04:39.070> admit<00:04:39.340> that<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.790> doesn't<00:04:40.390> let<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:40.570> have

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
to admit that it doesn't let you have
