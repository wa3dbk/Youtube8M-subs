00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.480
 Hi everyone! 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.900
 Today I show you a glowy, evening, makeup look 

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:23.979
 As you can see I just got back from vacation 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.080
 So my skin color is slightly darker than normal. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.880
 That is why I use this foundation, this is the MAC Face and body foundation in C5 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.715
 That is the darkest foundation I have. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 Normally I would go for something that covers more, because it is very light. 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.080
 I just realized, I don't even have a mirror (lol) 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.307
 So well prepared man ... 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.520
 Also got some coffee NATURAL CARRÃ‰ 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.160
 I already have cream on my face and now I start with the foundation 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 Shake ff, WHOOOOOOOOO 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 And then I dot it on my face. 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.700
 It was time for a new makeup video, because I have done a lot more fashion lately. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.400
 Something I just really like, but I recently experimented with makeup 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 And I thought "let me do another one" 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.520
 Then I grab my Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.449
 In Light Neutral 

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:23.029
 Because it is so light, it is a good color to highlight with under my eyes. 

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:26.869
 So I use it as a concealer / highlighter product 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.489
 That is why I also apply it to my nose bridge, around my nose, my chin, and my forehead. 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.120
 Then I use a flat brush to blend it. 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.400
 I blend it down and blend it in a triangle. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.060
 Then I blend it out well with my finger. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.860
 Then I apply a powder, I use the Chanel Universelle Powder. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.220
 I apply a nice layer 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.260
 Now that I have done my foundation, I fill in my eyebrows with the Catrice eyebrow powder 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.920
 I use the darkest color here. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.000
 I start at the top, making sure that it is a straight line, and then I fill in the rest. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.420
 Then I use the Too Faced Shadow Unsurance as a basis. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.900
 I grab a little bit and apply that. 

00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:32.437
 Then I use the MAC Vanilla pigment. 

00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:37.415
 And I apply that with a flat brush. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.720
 If you have the idea that you get glitter everywhere, you can always put something under your eye. 

00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:49.151
 So that the concealer under your eyes is not ruined. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.560
 Apply it up to the arcade arch. 

00:02:56.028 --> 00:03:01.288
 Then I blend the edges with a fluffy brush. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.560
 Then I use MAKEUP GEEK Cocoa Bear eye shadow in my arcade arch. 

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:19.758
 Then I blend that out a bit too. 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.620
 Then I apply the Vanilla Pigment 1 more time. 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.600
 Then I use a Kohl brush, this is Lancome. I draw a thick line above my eyes. 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.980
 Then with a slanted brush, I'm going to blend it a little and make it a little smokier. 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.780
 Then I apply mascara, this is the L'oreal Mega Volume Miss Manga mascara. 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.480
 I thought this mascara was not tested on animals, but apparently it was! 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.160
 The L'oreal site says no, so be careful. 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.500
 I thought they were honest MARRIABLE NOT JEEMIA NO MAN 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.720
 If you still know good mascaras, please leave it behind! 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 After my mascara I apply a nude colored eye pencil to my waterline. 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.720
 Because it makes your eyes look bigger. 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.860
 That is why we use this, because we want to be beautiful! 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.500
 Now that we're done with the eyes, I'm going to contour my face a bit. 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.860
 I use the Benefit Hoola bronzer and an angled brush. 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.880
 Also don't forget your neck, your jaw, and your forehead. 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.060
 You can also contour your nose a little, if you want it smaller. 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.160
 We are already applying a lot of makeup anyway, and might as well apply even more 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.760
 Then I use the MAC Sheertone Blush in Peaches. 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.940
 A bit on the apples from my cheeks. Also the other side (duh.) 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.640
 Then I use the Mac Skinfinish in Soft &amp; Gentle. I apply it with a flat brush. 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.620
 I will highlight that! 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:27.180
 On my forehead, my nose bridge, cupid bow, chin, neck, cheeks, under my eyebrows, and a little in the corners of my eyes. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.800
 I already applied a lip moisturizer before I started filming this video. 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.820
 The red lipstick that I am going to use has an orange undertone and it is Lady Danger from MAC. 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.640
 It is incredibly beautiful and incredibly BEAUTIFUL 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.220
 I often apply the lipstick first and then the lip liner, I don't know exactly why. It works better for me. 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.240
 Then I use a red lip liner. Where's mine then? Oh there. (so stupid to subtitle this) 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.365
 He rolled away man 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.280
 I don't know exactly which brand it belongs to, because everything is in FRENCH 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.980
 Then I line just above my own lip line. 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:25.020
 I applied lip liner on one side and not on the other. And you certainly see a difference. 

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:35.087
 So so! Wow, suddenly it is really very light. 

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:37.527
 It seems like I have never been on vacation 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.480
 Never thought I'd ever say this, but sun: blown away. 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.441
 Now go back to the normal liiiichttt !! 

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:45.842
 OHMYGOD 

00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:47.082
 GO AWAY. 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.200
 This is the end result. Let me THOUGHT my hair FOR YOU
