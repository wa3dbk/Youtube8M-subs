come<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.650> I've<00:02:56.459> got<00:02:56.489> tons<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.180> them<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.360> I'd

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
come in I've got tons of them but I'd

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.630 
come in I've got tons of them but I'd
crank<00:02:57.959> him<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.260> pretty<00:02:58.410> fast<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.340> least<00:02:59.459> I

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
crank him out pretty fast to at least I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.000 
crank him out pretty fast to at least I
think<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.080> get<00:03:01.260> them<00:03:01.350> done<00:03:01.440> accurately

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
think so and I get them done accurately

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.710 
think so and I get them done accurately
and<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> key<00:03:02.580> no<00:03:02.880> one's<00:03:03.060> perfect

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and that's the key no one's perfect

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.690 
and that's the key no one's perfect
even<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> bands<00:03:04.680> himself<00:03:05.160> changed<00:03:05.550> things

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
even the bands himself changed things

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.090 
even the bands himself changed things
around<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.660> say<00:03:06.870> accurately<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.770> means

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
around so when I say accurately it means

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.330 
around so when I say accurately it means
is<00:03:08.489> true<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.540> actual<00:03:10.260> version<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.130> can

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
is true to the actual version as you can

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.699 
is true to the actual version as you can
get<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> most<00:03:12.480> part<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.530> say<00:03:13.680> a

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
get for the most part but to say a

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.110 
get for the most part but to say a
hundred<00:03:13.920> percent<00:03:14.130> no<00:03:14.580> one<00:03:14.700> does<00:03:14.910> that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
hundred percent no one does that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.720 
hundred percent no one does that
alright<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> integrity

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
alright so but I do have the integrity

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.009 
alright so but I do have the integrity
behind<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.269> don't<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.600> keep<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.959> way

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
behind it don't want to keep it that way

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.870 
behind it don't want to keep it that way
if<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.620> couldn't<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.370> way<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.610> wouldn't

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
if I couldn't do it that way I wouldn't

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.550 
if I couldn't do it that way I wouldn't
even<00:03:21.000> bother<00:03:21.239> with<00:03:21.450> doing<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.870> channel<00:03:22.260> I'm<00:03:22.380> not
