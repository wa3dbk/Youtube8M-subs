 great barry this makeup i 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.590
 obviously I would use it for the night 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.020
 yes, because it 's a little bit 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 charged but this is one of the shadows 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.950
 what struck me the most when 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.380
 to buy the palette the puesteros line 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 of the cranberries is roses and so or 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.940
 moraditos and well did not extend them more 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.070
 Intro let's see then the tutorial 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.019
 let's start with the prebase as 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.629
 always today I will use the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.940
 to separate and we will put it very well 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.589
 around the mobile eyelid trying to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.480
 you blur pretty well so that 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.309
 do not stand and then on a shadow 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.369
 today we are going to use the palette 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.440
 from vice 3tv nikkei as I told them the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.170
 first tone will be the truck that is a tone 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.350
 that imitates and I'm going to put it in all the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.049
 eyebrow bone quite a bit 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.690
 and I'm also going to take advantage and I'm going to 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.820
 use it as the basis of the tapes 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.170
 shadows is doing it in all the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.170
 mobile eyelid that also 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.200
 we continue with tom daun who is a 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.690
 Brown cited half mate and we're going to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.970
 put in the entire eye socket to 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.150
 deepen and begin to define what 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 it will be the eye 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.130
 but always to combine quite well 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.530
 we follow then with shadow bondage 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.980
 this is an area with purple enough 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.080
 dark and I will use the brush 224 of 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.300
 soeva that is a brush to illuminate a lot 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.430
 smaller and more precise and I'll put it 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.000
 in the eye socket and also at the end 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.330
 of the eye in the form of b blurring towards 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330
 in 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.920
 we continue with the tone of my alchemy that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.870
 It is a very beautiful cranberry tone 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.629
 vibrant here so that it intensifies 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.670
 I've wet it even more with the sea ​​pix 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.739
 they can also very do it with water 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.840
 whatever it is so that the tone concentrates 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.200
 even more and I'll place it in all the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.340
 center the mobile eyelid and also up 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.340
 the lacrimal conpes 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.470
 and yes of course now we are going to 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.060
 blur to try to mix with a 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 little tones but not too much 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.620
 because they are quite strong tones one with 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.170
 the other and I will use the same tone 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.570
 cranberry and the purple shadow now 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.720
 also in the lower eyelid of equal 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.720
 way 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.530
 in the final part I will intensify a 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.140
 little more on the upper eyelid for 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.790
 make a kind of turning with the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.769
 same mud shadow so that it 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 intensify the look a little more 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.420
 at the end more or less like this 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.560
 I continue with the face I will use the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.900
 mac fluid corrector and can clean 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.970
 everything that could have fallen and continued 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.440
 with the loose powder to seal the base 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.790
 that I have already put in mind that all 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.349
 products that I am always using 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.110
 He left us written in the box 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.150
 information below I am then now the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.660
 Concealer with queen powder in tone 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.660
 banana 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.000
 now I will use the shadow moved 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.340
 he is a pretty white shadow 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.390
 in the lacrimal way to illuminate or in 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.240
 the part in front of the eye now we pass to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.520
 the eyeliner can use the yuri dvd 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.110
 inside and I'm going to make a delineated one 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.070
 little bit catlike because 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.070
 merits this makeup 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.870
 and 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.230
 now we continue with the pencil can 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.300
 use this one that is in serious tone and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.579
 also of farts the one that does not have a tone 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.200
 so you can also use a book and what 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.640
 I will place on the entire water line 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.860
 I think it's the tone that most 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.180
 intensify this what we follow 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.430
 then with the eye mask can 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.720
 use the essence of well-vigilant 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.720
 that I love 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.010
 and of course this look can not be 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.990
 complete if we do not use good ones 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.990
 false eyelashes those that can not 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.660
 put on two or three layers as topics 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.960
 and with the eyes we already finished perfect 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.960
 true 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.660
 we continue now with the red that I'm going to 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.660
 use the pecan de mix outline 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.020
 as powder to use the floating favor 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.020
 plus 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.150
 and as an illuminator use today 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.150
 the rose style also from mac 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.479
 and 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.080
 of lipstick use the color post 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:36.370
 also issue here we are ready so is 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.370
 How is this place 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.430
 pretty autumnal 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.430
 easy to make 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.470
