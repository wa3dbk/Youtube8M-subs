00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:13.269
 this is gambling flashback in games 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:15.370
 which we grew up studio raven 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.340
 start a collaboration with the legendary of 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.650
 fbi in the year of the doom and now a year later 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.110
 exactly 20 years ago they released 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.060
 joint project critic game on 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.570
 following from the thought not only a genre but also 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.670
 engine 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.680
 some weapons were nearly 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.200
 full copies of their martian 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.510
 analogs of the amendment to the fantasy world but 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.940
 the dawn of the genre of three-dimensional action films few 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.250
 would consider it as a flaw every game 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.290
 perceived as separate events 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 the more so because the young genre is a huge field 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.180
 for creativity in 9-ke added 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.340
 revolutionary opportunity to aim for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.720
 vertical had to pick up a crossbow 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.280
 up to shoot fire 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.690
 gargoyle while duma 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.079
 aiming vertically was 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.090
 automatic enemies in the game of 16 types but 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.340
 about a third of them are just ghostly 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.960
 entities already familiar to us monsters for 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.019
 their destruction developers 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.240
 provided for 8 types of weapons and more 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.460
 one revolution is improving back 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.710
 if you pick up that village and each one 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.510
 transformed by adding an alternate 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.640
 attack or enhances the range 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.990
 how to become and it was not the only one 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.940
 useful artifact 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.010
 quite often came across vials 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.740
 restoring health a little less 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.840
 torch and dispel darkness and even wings 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.790
 anger giving ability to fly 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.979
 the cutest artifact turned 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.549
 the enemy in the chicken and he looked 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.500
 guess correctly like an egg and another in 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.119
 Unlike doom use artifacts 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 it was possible as needed they 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.810
 instantly 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.640
 long live the inventory and so the player to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.830
 the finals did not accumulate a dozen rings and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.659
 transitions between levels 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.620
 we were left only one copy 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.070
 naha 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.170
 later there was a series of continuations besides 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 separate fantasy has sprung from the game 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 action haxon popular in the mid-90s 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 years of the last century
