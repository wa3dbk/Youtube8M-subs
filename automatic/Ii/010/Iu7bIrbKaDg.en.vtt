grow<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.820> top<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.329> how<00:02:00.420> short<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
grow up on top and look how short the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:15.020 
grow up on top and look how short the
roots<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.770> tiny

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.550 

well<00:02:16.030> once<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.390> started<00:02:16.690> doing<00:02:16.750> weekly<00:02:17.230> water

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
well once I started doing weekly water

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.530 
well once I started doing weekly water
changes<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.220> plant<00:02:18.490> really<00:02:18.940> responded

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
changes the plant really responded

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.430 
changes the plant really responded
really<00:02:19.750> will<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.480> want<00:02:22.690> if<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.230> want

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
really will so if you want if you want

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.010 
really will so if you want if you want
to<00:02:23.819> attempt<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.480> definitely

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
to attempt to do this I definitely

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.480 
to attempt to do this I definitely
recommend<00:02:26.290> doing<00:02:26.650> weekly<00:02:27.130> water<00:02:27.400> changes

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
recommend doing weekly water changes

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.380 
recommend doing weekly water changes
it's<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:30.400> made<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> big<00:02:30.819> big<00:02:31.120> huge

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's a really made a big big huge

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.449 
it's a really made a big big huge
difference<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.260> here's<00:02:32.590> August<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.250> mean<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
difference and here's August I mean this

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.820 
difference and here's August I mean this
thing<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:34.140> pumping<00:02:35.140> out<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.440> various

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
thing was just pumping out the various

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540 
thing was just pumping out the various
it<00:02:36.010> was<00:02:36.100> pretty<00:02:36.700> amazing<00:02:37.030> at<00:02:38.400> how<00:02:39.400> many

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
it was pretty amazing at how many

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.340 
it was pretty amazing at how many
berries<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.000> get<00:02:40.300> out<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.750> stuff<00:02:41.020> for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
berries I get out of just stuff for

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.390 
berries I get out of just stuff for
plants<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.940> little<00:02:43.150> tote<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:44.400> my

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
plants and I have this little tote in my

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.870 
plants and I have this little tote in my
opinion<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:46.680> hydroponics<00:02:47.680> does<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.130> it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
opinion what hydroponics does is it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.650 
opinion what hydroponics does is it
really<00:02:49.180> gets<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:50.250> can't<00:02:51.250> wait<00:02:51.459> mumblings<00:02:52.330> close

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
really gets I can't wait mumblings close

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.320 
really gets I can't wait mumblings close
in<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.930> bag<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:54.100> hydroponics<00:02:54.760> does<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.209> me

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
in this bag what hydroponics does for me

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330 
in this bag what hydroponics does for me
is<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:56.050> think<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:56.860> get<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.160> most

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is that I think you can get the most

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.380 
is that I think you can get the most
potential<00:02:58.150> at<00:02:58.989> your<00:02:59.350> plants<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.300> what<00:03:01.300> I'm

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
potential at your plants and what I'm

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.790 
potential at your plants and what I'm
trying<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.630> say<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.019> well<00:03:02.260> let's<00:03:02.440> say<00:03:02.560> your

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
trying to say is well let's say your

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.770 
trying to say is well let's say your
plant<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:04.560> seascape<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.430> they<00:03:06.850> be<00:03:06.910> estimate

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
plant is seascape so they be estimate

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.850 
plant is seascape so they be estimate
you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.050> get<00:03:08.170> pound<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.620> pound<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> half<00:03:08.950> of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
you can get pound a pound and a half of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.559 
you can get pound a pound and a half of
berries<00:03:11.860> per<00:03:12.040> plant<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.819> hydroponics<00:03:13.150> I

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
berries per plant with hydroponics I

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.570 
berries per plant with hydroponics I
figuring<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.080> closer<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.709> two<00:03:15.160> pound<00:03:15.489> in

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
figuring it closer to the two pound in

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.449 
figuring it closer to the two pound in
half<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:16.180> mean<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:17.380> depends<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.800> on<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
half I mean it all depends on on the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.330 
half I mean it all depends on on the
type<00:03:18.670> strawberry<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.769> every<00:03:21.070> plant

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
type strawberry have and not every plant

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.150 
type strawberry have and not every plant
it's<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.820> have<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.230> regime<00:03:23.230> X<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.860> get<00:03:23.980> it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
it's going to have a regime X to get it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.819 
it's going to have a regime X to get it
pounded<00:03:24.519> out<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.120> was<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> really<00:03:26.320> press<00:03:26.650> on

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
pounded out that I was a really press on

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.620 
pounded out that I was a really press on
how<00:03:26.980> well<00:03:27.190> these<00:03:27.340> guys<00:03:27.549> did<00:03:30.480> well<00:03:31.480> when<00:03:31.600> I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
how well these guys did well when I

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.050 
how well these guys did well when I
first<00:03:31.870> started<00:03:32.019> this<00:03:32.519> little<00:03:33.519> project<00:03:33.730> or

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
first started this little project or

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.400

mixed in between those and there again
this<00:03:55.239> picture<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.750> roots<00:03:55.930> clip<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.739> roots

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
this picture the roots clip the roots

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.699 
this picture the roots clip the roots
and<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.870> mean<00:03:58.870> look<00:03:59.049> at<00:03:59.109> that<00:03:59.170> one<00:03:59.380> right<00:03:59.500> there

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
and I mean look at that one right there

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.710 
and I mean look at that one right there
is<00:03:59.920> hardly<00:04:00.280> any<00:04:00.549> root<00:04:00.820> growth<00:04:01.000> whatsoever<00:04:01.209> but

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
is hardly any root growth whatsoever but

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.960 
is hardly any root growth whatsoever but
you<00:04:01.780> look<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.079> top<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:03.340> ton<00:04:03.940> of

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you look on top and just a ton of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.060 
you look on top and just a ton of
vegetation<00:04:04.480> ton<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.320> branches<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:05.799> ton<00:04:06.040> of

vegetation ton of branches and ton of
berries<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:07.680> that's<00:04:08.680> pretty<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.519> know<00:04:10.480> that

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
berries and that's pretty I know that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.599
