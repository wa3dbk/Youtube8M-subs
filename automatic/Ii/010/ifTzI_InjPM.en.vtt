00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
that's definitely the case actually kind

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.760 
that's definitely the case actually kind
of<00:04:44.360> easy<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.720> win<00:04:44.900> once<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.230> learn<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.410> track

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
of easy to win once you learn the track

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.440 
of easy to win once you learn the track
it<00:04:45.950> seems<00:04:46.220> would<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.760> agree<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.090> Sean

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
it seems would you agree with that Sean

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.930 
it seems would you agree with that Sean
yeah<00:04:48.050> yeah<00:04:48.440> definitely<00:04:49.070> it's<00:04:49.160> pretty<00:04:49.730> easy

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
yeah yeah definitely it's pretty easy

yeah yeah definitely it's pretty easy
going<00:04:50.300> if<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.780> know<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.140> route<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.380> should

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
going if you know the route you should

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.970 
going if you know the route you should
have<00:04:52.070> no<00:04:52.250> problem<00:04:52.280> beating<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.060> AI

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
have no problem beating the AI

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840 
have no problem beating the AI
especially<00:04:54.980> if<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.100> bump<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.520> bang<00:04:55.670> them<00:04:55.820> a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
especially if you bump and bang them a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.460 
especially if you bump and bang them a
little<00:04:55.970> bit<00:04:56.210> yeah<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.660> just<00:04:56.900> race<00:04:57.140> against

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
little bit yeah you just race against

of my head give it you know we've been
raiding<00:05:38.419> quite<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.720> few<00:05:38.930> games<00:05:39.110> lately<00:05:39.500> but<00:05:40.250> i'm

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
raiding quite a few games lately but i'm

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.409 
raiding quite a few games lately but i'm
going<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.520> give<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.640> what<00:05:40.850> I<00:05:40.880> think<00:05:40.970> would<00:05:41.240> off

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
going to give you what I think would off

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.270 
going to give you what I think would off
the<00:05:41.570> top<00:05:41.780> my<00:05:41.810> head<00:05:41.990> would<00:05:42.229> be<00:05:42.410> my<00:05:42.620> rating<00:05:43.130> on

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
the top my head would be my rating on

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.420 
the top my head would be my rating on
this<00:05:43.490> game<00:05:43.760> I<00:05:44.090> gotta<00:05:45.080> say<00:05:45.260> man<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:46.010> think

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
this game I gotta say man I I I think

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.650 
this game I gotta say man I I I think
this<00:05:46.520> is<00:05:46.669> going<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:46.820> be<00:05:46.910> close<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.330> nine<00:05:47.510> he

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
this is going to be close to the nine he

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.180 
this is going to be close to the nine he
especially<00:05:47.870> we<00:05:48.080> take<00:05:48.229> off<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.500> physics<00:05:48.919> they

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
especially we take off the physics they

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.370 
especially we take off the physics they
get<00:05:49.340> an<00:05:49.430> on<00:05:49.580> sim<00:05:49.940> title<00:05:50.360> what<00:05:50.930> do<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.020> think<00:05:51.110> as

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
get an on sim title what do you think as

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.860 
get an on sim title what do you think as
a<00:05:51.560> game<00:05:51.919> absolutely<00:05:52.669> i<00:05:52.700> mean<00:05:52.760> it's<00:05:53.030> it's<00:05:53.300> not<00:05:53.840> a

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
a game absolutely i mean it's it's not a

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.630 
a game absolutely i mean it's it's not a
physics<00:05:54.410> game<00:05:54.650> there's<00:05:54.950> no<00:05:55.100> force<00:05:55.370> feedback

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
physics game there's no force feedback

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.820 
physics game there's no force feedback
obviously<00:05:56.450> it<00:05:56.600> so<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.229> really<00:05:57.260> comes<00:05:57.620> down<00:05:57.710> to

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
obviously it so it really comes down to

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.950 
obviously it so it really comes down to
fun<00:05:58.250> factor<00:05:58.729> graphics<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.540> stuff<00:05:59.630> like<00:05:59.900> that

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
fun factor graphics and stuff like that

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.420 
fun factor graphics and stuff like that
and<00:06:00.140> I<00:06:00.410> mean

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
and I mean

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.880 
and I mean
