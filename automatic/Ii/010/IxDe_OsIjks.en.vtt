00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
Joker that's been so difficult has been

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.080 
Joker that's been so difficult has been
his<00:02:10.750> inability<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.470> round<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.190> drop<00:02:12.580> he's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it's an intermediate gait so it didn't

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.060 
it's an intermediate gait so it didn't
cause<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> lot<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> tension<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.740> he<00:02:23.920> could

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
cause a lot of tension and he could

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.699 
cause a lot of tension and he could
stretch<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.490> work<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:26.230> more<00:02:26.410> we<00:02:26.530> did
