 usinger the product range original 1923 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.900
 invented here in keel of that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 company founder walter schröder the die 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.489
 groundbreaking idea an anvil 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 Cutting technique invented has been there 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.720
 a blade on a flat surface 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.040
 unlike other pruning shears 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.940
 gets past each other two knives 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.710
 shearing the so-called bypass technique 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 Our lion number one also corresponds 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.620
 a construction size capacity the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 original model from 1923 in 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.320
 the rest can actually be even the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 Blade this scissors into the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.720
 built-in model from 1923 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.100
 the latest state of development is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 meanwhile that one works best with one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 born blade and a curved one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.049
 Unterlage manufactures these scissors 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 allow the highest possible control 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 about the cut goods at three are the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.770
 These scissors sound thinner 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 this is possible at the hamburger marriage 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.290
 as with a bypass shear what in turn 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.790
 contributes to a lighter cut and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.680
 when they start results-See the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.450
 if they find an absolute 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.890
 cleaner did not cut the injury 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.960
 pension no squeeze 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.150
 that is possible with this quality of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.320
 marching original 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.270
 Wear parts such as blade and underlay 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 they can be easily replaced 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.510
 and if you look at the price of such 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.970
 Replacement blade on the number of 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.740
 cuts up from 500,000 to 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.290
 about a million cuts depending on 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 wood we calculate a price 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.400
 per cut from 00 00 02 euro and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.350
 no one can cut many cheaper 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.270
 visited in jürgen weeks 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.720
 partners and users around the world 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.150
 from china over brazil from australia 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 all of us are united to europe 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.880
 original lion is the perfect tool 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.860
 for professionals next to the number one lion 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
 we have further scissors 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
 develops the specific applications 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.520
 can be advantageous again 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.380
 For example, to show the number 5 one 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.420
 very small and very handy scissors 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.040
 here we have a shorter blade 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 we can grind accordingly thinner 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.550
 and this scissors is for example 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.290
 Thinner branch diameter of 18 to 20 mm 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.180
 the best choice especially since this scissors and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.180
 compare easily cuts fast 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.530
 Resistance is no longer noticeable 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.330
 in a more pointed configuration of the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.210
 cut it for close access 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.850
 For example, in viticulture is 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.980
 this scissors lion number six one 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.660
 Anvil scissors with additional 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.730
 equipment features a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.170
 outboard blade for very fast 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.910
 sound change a handle 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.010
 Adjustment that allows the scissors 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.420
 individually to the user's hand size 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.850
 equipped for about 25 years 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.490
 years in the assortment loewe number 9 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.350
 A bypass scissor features this scissors 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.150
 about the same features as the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.890
 scissors number 6 you have one 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.380
 reach adjustment to the individual 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.760
 Adjustment of the hand size also the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.770
 outside line for a quick sword 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.460
 sound change but this scissors 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.690
 works in bypass technology and it at that time 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.450
 applications particularly suitable where 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.240
 very close to the trunk 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 need to complete the start two completely 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.290
 to cut zero off 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 are anvil shears of original lion 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.760
 world market leaders our different 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.430
 Models ensure for each 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.090
 requirement the highest quality made in 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 germany 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.220
 by the way, the anvil shear was replaced by the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.140
 grandfather of our present 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.540
 he invented the managing director 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.930
 tradition of the best price performance 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.240
 ratio shears all 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.959
 we put in three different grip 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.329
 shape 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.590
 so the lower handle is found either 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 swinging outwards 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.380
 for big hands swinging inwards 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.530
 for a normal or rather small hand 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.960
 size and alternatively in one function 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.180
 as anticipation with a grip around 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.760
 the own axis turns and thus the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.640
 friction between the palm and the handle 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.380
 Material completely eliminated and at 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.840

 Wine growers cut from 12 to 15,000 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.160
 in the day can imagine how much 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.850
 play here when they form this 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.860
 not functions of 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.810
 features of our number 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.210
 8 and some more serious ones 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.130
 Models is a continuously adjustable 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.470
 reach possible over this 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.780
 Set screw with the distance 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.740
 of each other individually 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.900
 can adjust 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.060
 In addition to the preselection of a larger or 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.130
 smaller curved inside or outside 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.020
 do you have any possibility of the handle 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.010
 optimal on your own hand 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.780
