00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
one is you need to make sure that to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.000 
one is you need to make sure that to
10,000<00:00:56.739> deaths<00:00:57.730> or<00:00:58.180> kills<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.720> so<00:00:59.710> that<00:00:59.860> the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
someone you also need to make sure that

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.300 
someone you also need to make sure that
the<00:01:03.790> items<00:01:03.880> are<00:01:04.390> dropped<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:04.839> Death<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.380> died

the items are dropped on Death and died

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.540 
the items are dropped on Death and died
it<00:01:06.790> doesn't<00:01:07.090> really<00:01:07.180> matter<00:01:07.420> which<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:08.550> which

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
it doesn't really matter which I which

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.030 
it doesn't really matter which I which
map<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:10.030> pick<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> plateau<00:01:11.170> is<00:01:11.410> definitely

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
map you pick but a plateau is definitely

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.150 
map you pick but a plateau is definitely
the<00:01:12.130> easiest<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:15.420> once<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.570> start<00:01:16.840> that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
the easiest so once you start that

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.230 
the easiest so once you start that
should<00:01:18.160> again<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:20.909> unpause<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:21.970> video

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
should again and all unpause the video

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.020 
should again and all unpause the video
once<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.930> gets<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.409> why<00:01:23.860> once<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> gates<00:01:24.820> go

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
once it gets to why once the gates go

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.510 
once it gets to why once the gates go
down<00:01:25.210> alright<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.380> now<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:27.190> gates<00:01:27.400> are

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
down alright so now I the gates are

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.610 
down alright so now I the gates are
going<00:01:27.790> down<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.299> you're<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.290> want<00:01:29.500> to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
helping you by down to the portal on the

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.770 
helping you by down to the portal on the
opposing<00:01:37.390> team<00:01:37.780> side<00:01:38.110> um<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.299> really<00:01:40.630> only

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
opposing team side um this really only

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.340 
opposing team side um this really only
works<00:01:41.110> well<00:01:41.680> if<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:43.000> ton<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:43.960> people

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
works well if you have a a ton of people

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.640 
works well if you have a a ton of people
so<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.590> they<00:01:44.770> die<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.340> hit<00:01:45.400> but<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.650> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
so that they die in one hit but on the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.149 
so that they die in one hit but on the
basic<00:01:48.610> theory<00:01:48.880> behind<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.330> ler<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.979> want

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
basic theory behind this ler is you want

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.500 
basic theory behind this ler is you want
to<00:01:51.250> call<00:01:51.460> them<00:01:51.490> out<00:01:51.760> before<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.240> high<00:01:52.450> it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
to call them out before they high it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.780 
to call them out before they high it
before<00:01:53.170> they<00:01:53.260> have<00:01:53.380> time<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.650> react<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.159> put<00:01:54.700> on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
before they have time to react to put on

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.840 
before they have time to react to put on
protect<00:01:55.180> item<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:57.189> way<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.400> get<00:01:57.640> whatever

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
protect item I that way you get whatever

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.450 
protect item I that way you get whatever
item<00:01:58.330> they<00:01:58.450> bring<00:01:58.689> in<00:01:58.840> um<00:01:59.280> you're<00:02:00.280> going<00:02:00.400> to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
item they bring in um you're going to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.859 
item they bring in um you're going to
want<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> make<00:02:00.759> sure<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:01.090> your<00:02:01.420> partner<00:02:01.750> is

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
want to make sure that your partner is

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.770 
want to make sure that your partner is
just<00:02:02.400> over<00:02:03.400> here<00:02:03.549> behind<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.909> portal<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.540> of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
just over here behind the portal out of

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.870 
just over here behind the portal out of
the<00:02:04.840> way<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.979> don't<00:02:06.159> accidentally<00:02:06.580> attack

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the way so you don't accidentally attack

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.830 
the way so you don't accidentally attack
him<00:02:07.150> and<00:02:07.590> um<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.820> that's<00:02:10.179> pretty<00:02:10.450> much<00:02:10.540> how

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
him and um and so that's pretty much how

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.699 
him and um and so that's pretty much how
