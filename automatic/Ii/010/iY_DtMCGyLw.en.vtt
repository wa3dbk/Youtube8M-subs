00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 on a tony mango and I'm a catcher 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.759
 in pole football team 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:16.760
 innovation india then I was doing 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 so soccer soccer 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 then one day my big brother came to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.910
 house telling me is in jail and I'm going 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 register for american football 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 I said okay what is it or is it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.670
 that you intend to do and find yourself 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 that in fact in my own life I had the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.980
 France's best team is one of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 best in europe 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.809
 it was my goal it was always 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 my goal to play at this level 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.899
 but it's really after being 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 junior champion of France and then 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.930
 after being sent to a camp 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.600
 football in america may well exist in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.809
 Idaho realized that here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 even though I'm French I can 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.489
 play in first division university 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 I am I had and listened to my 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 instinct I really even contacted 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.750
 a lot of a lot of coaches there are 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 academic but the problem that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500
 always came back were French 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.619
 so we do not know what you're worth against 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.320
 the Americans and following that there is a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.909
 old flash collar that contacted me in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.619
 saying this is me I just received 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 an offer 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.840
 I left europe and noticed in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.400
 california houses college and i te 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.189
 know you know me I know you have 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.750
 want to have been a chance so is 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.090
 what you want to live this experience 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.009
 with me I jumped on the theme here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.640
 I am a French who arrives at the states 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.220
 united trying to take their 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.299
 place but trying to play in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 first division 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.979
 be aware that it's not all 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.719
 Americans who will play indivision 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 as and when I train 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.530
 gained respect from two methods of all 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.109
 my teammates to be able to be 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 eligible and plays football before 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.479
 to be allowed to bring the outfit and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.840
 play on the ground you'll have the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.540
 average 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 then yes 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.100
 the school world is not apart at 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.770
 football world is trying I want 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.900
 play all of having since the weight of 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 time and ace is pretty restricted 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.800
 since with morning training 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 then the courses and then 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 football training meetings 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.860
 so the remaining time you can not the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.710
 spent to be with friends 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.840
 you have to work all the time all the time 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.230
 time all the time so during the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.940
 season I was a bit frustrated because I 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.010
 really thought you see there after my 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.770
 first part of the season 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.209
 all the heroes and cardboard tonita is this 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.880
 that you receive is what you have 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.940
 calls and jallet no news a 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.310
 week after winning these titles 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.430
 accused really been calls d d a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.530
 a lot of fans came to the campus his 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.989
 campus directly via prÃ¨ here is there 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.700
 had a lot of a lot of contacts in 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.080
 a few weeks while we are 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 also brings closer final exams so 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 it's not obvious at all it's a 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.489
 exciting and at the same time you study 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.170
 here you know what you wanted but in 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.550
 same time there are exams and you know 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
 very well that without these exams 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.360
 you can not be in syria so chose 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.010
 paul ii a new series because 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.750
 academically it's a very very 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.930
 big school that recognized worldwide 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.530
 especially in the field of 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.709
 engineering 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.340
 So you can be an engineer but hey you 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.959
 never know but after that the level is 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.360
 of the football team for me was 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.180
 also a factor 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.420
 the water chick phase evolves in a 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.540
 excellent conference the big ten so 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.190
 here is there are seven bland word will do all this 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.020
 that I wanted so anemic attack me 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.030
 I already said is now folder 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.450
 all the sports facilities that will me 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.460
 enable me to develop to reach 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 my personal goals 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.200
 I think me in my mind 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.750
 I really want to do things that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.200
 who have been rarely made to see everything from 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.620
 never seen 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.110
 so here is evolved in France and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 leave here in the first division is 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.140
 something is something that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.130
 Mark 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.620
 I want to mark the spirits Game 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.760
 marked history in my own way 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.510
 but after you have to put the work two 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.120
 years except that most do not 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.310
 not counting everything you need to 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.950
 happen so especially what I said 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.410
 it's the school part that's it 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.710
 that everyone needs to understand 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.190
 if you do not work, you'll never go 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.330
 stopped talking well but it is that the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.200
 foot acts regarding the results 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.770
 who do not have the next stage this is the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.860
 holder in my fac win a title 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.750
 and then that tells me that if I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.419
 am i'm training to help my team 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.370
 to win a title it's savadra 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.210
 direction being and the best 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.410
 receivers of the league and then said if 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.910
 do you like hero flavors why do you 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.110
 could I not do too much if you are 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.400
 better here it's not because you're 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.169
 French that we will not take the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900
 evidence 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.599
 I had several so not my grants the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.330
 first step its holders win a 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.580
 title with my team and then that's it 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.029
 the nfl is always in these images of 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.029
 background in dia
