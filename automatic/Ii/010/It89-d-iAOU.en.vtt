00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello people here is vector of the ball 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.760
 sweeper fans on the balcony stood at the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.030
 rother live in eppelsheim and here have 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.549
 i mean my favorite copter is totally 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 new and that's nice that's it 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.539
 my mini is the x3 50 pro premium 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 the gps now has two 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 different channels and a channel 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.939
 receives gps and receives a channel 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 Gruners these are the Russian ones 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.980
 satellite 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.360
 Therefore, the accuracy is very high it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
 is received very quickly 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 then he has a fish's eye in front 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.860
 camera if I fly like this now 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.039
 In principle I see everything that is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 wonderful for the fcv plow suitable 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.199
 camera has a send module for this 58 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.730
 he actually has an 8s lithium 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.410
 Polymer Battery packs it's motors 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 350 kv what very long flight times 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.930
 allows here on the back is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.760
 also quite new a panel on the the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.290
 functions are shown or the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.090
 I have checks here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.420
 I see the remote control is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 the compass is ok and gps 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 barometer is provided a country 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 scarce but also take 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 he is not like server here 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.860
 close but the hand, however 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 not at all that landed by a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.439
 replace longer and at this copter 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.420
 also a normal kimball hang with 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.490
 one where or with a camera 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 so I theoretically also two 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 can operate cameras 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 with a separate monitor or in the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.439
 glasses which are still interesting here inside 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 everything is modular in it 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.829
 everything is plugged there are no cables 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 more all these receivers the whole 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.350
 adopter flight control the free 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.119
 is programmable as with all was 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.070
 karas is now on the pedestal and everything is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 put that means if something is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.610
 if i have an extension module 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 I just want to install it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.569
 Put in here and what he has left is 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 the ground station is also called here 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.489
 is integrated with brown station which with 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.660
 an android tablets and soon 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:22.709
 ios devices probably work i 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 can control the thing in flight via tablet 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.330
 I can handle autonomous emissions with the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.950
 program tablet and the thing is 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.680
 really handy I can do it 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 always take with you 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.920
 this is mine for me at the moment 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.830
 favorite head 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.180
 he looks really nice and me too 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.129
 I'm also looking forward to our 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.129
 passenger she will do in the next
