sort of like you see here within this

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
sort of like you see here within this

then<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> few<00:01:13.920> days<00:01:14.570> finding<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
then it's been a few days finding that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.179 
then it's been a few days finding that
area<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.110> support<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> broke

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
area of support and then it broke

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
area of support and then it broke
through<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.000> same<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> action

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
through that's the same sort of action

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.760 
through that's the same sort of action
that<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.610> need<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:22.229> place

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that you would need to see take place

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.450 
that you would need to see take place
and<00:01:23.509> if<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.810> move<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and if we now move this on to the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.740 
and if we now move this on to the
quarter<00:01:27.240> day<00:01:27.509> chart<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.329> high<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.720> now

is<00:01:31.130> 3164<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.090> may<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.329> still<00:01:33.810> rallying<00:01:34.500> as

this a video but what's interesting is

always<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:20.670> 29<00:02:21.670> 44<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.260> will<00:02:23.320> always<00:02:23.500> be

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
always be 29 44 well it will always be

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
always be 29 44 well it will always be
the<00:02:24.040> previous<00:02:24.640> fibonacci<00:02:25.120> level<00:02:25.720> so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the previous fibonacci level so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.850 
the previous fibonacci level so
therefore<00:02:26.680> for<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.280> market<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.020> really<00:02:29.020> hold

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
therefore for the market to really hold

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.030 
therefore for the market to really hold
up<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:31.330> first<00:02:31.690> level<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.140> support<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.860> in

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
up it the first level of support is in

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.650 
up it the first level of support is in
this<00:02:33.130> band<00:02:33.430> here<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.150> roughly<00:02:34.480> between

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
this band here which is roughly between

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.510 
this band here which is roughly between
30<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.790> 30<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.150> half<00:02:37.480> but<00:02:37.990> obviously<00:02:38.520> that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
30 and 30 and a half but obviously that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.010 
30 and 30 and a half but obviously that
really<00:02:39.940> does<00:02:40.180> need<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.710> stay<00:02:41.710> above<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.420> 29<00:02:43.420> 44

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
really does need to stay above the 29 44

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.130 
really does need to stay above the 29 44
variable<00:02:44.800> now<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.100> breaks<00:02:45.400> this

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
variable now if it breaks this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.470 
variable now if it breaks this
resistance<00:02:47.140> field<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.710> here<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.270> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
resistance field in here then what this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.170 
resistance field in here then what this
tells<00:02:49.780> us<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.230> there's<00:02:50.470> some<00:02:50.770> sort<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.190> forces

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
tells us is there's some sort of forces

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.870 
tells us is there's some sort of forces
going<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.470> unusual<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.700> might

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
going on that is unusual and you might

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.580 
going on that is unusual and you might
want<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.240> give<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.570> rally<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.110> benefit<00:02:56.560> of

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
want to give the rally the benefit of

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
want to give the rally the benefit of
the<00:02:56.920> deaf<00:02:57.100> now<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.550> very<00:02:57.700> easily<00:02:57.760> Pierce

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the deaf now it can very easily Pierce

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.170 
the deaf now it can very easily Pierce
above<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.230> find<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> resistance<00:03:00.910> point

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
above it and find the resistance point

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.840 
above it and find the resistance point
there<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.660> too<00:03:02.020> is<00:03:02.320> also<00:03:02.740> common<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:03.760> you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
there that too is also common but if you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.040 
there that too is also common but if you
start<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.210> notice<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> markets

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
start to notice that the markets

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.850 
start to notice that the markets
breaking<00:03:05.530> 32<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.400> up<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.640> even<00:03:06.820> 32<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.450> half

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
breaking 32 and up to even 32 and a half

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.730 
breaking 32 and up to even 32 and a half
then<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.190> really<00:03:09.730> want<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.450> expand<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
then you really want to expand the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.760 
then you really want to expand the
timeframes<00:03:12.700> out<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> more<00:03:14.050> longer<00:03:14.530> term

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
timeframes out to a more longer term

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.380 
timeframes out to a more longer term
time<00:03:15.460> frame<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.820> we'll<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
time frame and we'll do this on the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.530 
time frame and we'll do this on the
three-day<00:03:16.780> chart<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:18.400> next<00:03:18.790> suggested

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
three-day chart and it's next suggested

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.790 
three-day chart and it's next suggested
level<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.050> resistance<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:22.380> 3341<00:03:23.380> so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
level of resistance is that of 3341 so

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.190 
level of resistance is that of 3341 so
if<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:23.980> continues<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.030> continue<00:03:25.630> on<00:03:25.810> going

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
if it continues to continue on going

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.280 
if it continues to continue on going
further<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:27.640> would<00:03:27.970> be<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.240> expected<00:03:29.110> level

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
further that would be the expected level

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.200 
further that would be the expected level
which<00:03:29.680> was<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.130> area<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.550> previous<00:03:31.030> support

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
which was the area of previous support

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.190 
which was the area of previous support
and<00:03:31.960> an<00:03:32.770> area<00:03:33.130> where<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.610> consolidated<00:03:34.540> at<00:03:34.780> for

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
and an area where it consolidated at for

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.020 
and an area where it consolidated at for
the<00:03:35.470> end<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:37.230> 2011<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:39.100> as<00:03:39.550> far<00:03:39.700> as<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.880> whole

the end of 2011 and as far as the whole

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.780 
the end of 2011 and as far as the whole
long-term<00:03:40.510> time<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:41.020> concerned<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:42.520> have<00:03:42.760> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
long-term time is concerned we have a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.150 
long-term time is concerned we have a
high<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.270> 49<00:03:43.630> 81<00:03:44.170> from<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.560> end<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.740> april<00:03:44.890> of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
high of 49 81 from the end of april of

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.330 
high of 49 81 from the end of april of
last<00:03:45.220> year<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:45.880> then<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> low<00:03:46.240> of<00:03:46.270> 26<00:03:46.900> 10<00:03:47.380> from

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
last year and then the low of 26 10 from

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.040 
last year and then the low of 26 10 from
really<00:03:48.910> two<00:03:49.090> different<00:03:49.210> periods<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.870> was<00:03:49.990> a

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
really two different periods this was a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.510 
really two different periods this was a
four<00:03:50.290> cent<00:03:50.530> difference<00:03:50.710> within<00:03:51.070> both<00:03:51.340> of

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
four cent difference within both of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.940 
four cent difference within both of
these<00:03:51.610> lows<00:03:51.960> however<00:03:52.960> for<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.320> selling<00:03:53.800> to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
these lows however for this selling to

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520 
these lows however for this selling to
be<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.130> failed<00:03:54.520> move<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.120> needs<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.540> hold<00:03:56.080> and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
be a failed move it needs to hold and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.410 
be a failed move it needs to hold and
stay<00:03:56.770> above<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:57.340> significant<00:03:57.970> level<00:03:58.240> that's

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
stay above this significant level that's

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.300 
stay above this significant level that's
a<00:03:58.510> little<00:03:58.750> ways<00:03:58.900> away<00:03:58.930> right<00:03:59.470> now<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.830> that's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
a little ways away right now and that's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.570 
a little ways away right now and that's
at<00:04:00.580> 3891<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.960> like<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.290> number<00:04:02.560> 40<00:04:03.040> which

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
at 3891 so I like the number 40 which

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.150 
at 3891 so I like the number 40 which
gives<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> really<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.780> dollar<00:04:05.080> Pierce<00:04:05.740> above

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
gives you a really a dollar Pierce above

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.100 
gives you a really a dollar Pierce above
that<00:04:06.340> level<00:04:06.580> when<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.180> hold<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.930> stay

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
that level when it can hold and stay

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.460 
that level when it can hold and stay
above<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.500> for<00:04:09.010> more<00:04:09.730> than<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:10.180> two<00:04:11.110> or<00:04:11.140> three

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
above that for more than a two or three

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.860 
above that for more than a two or three
weeks<00:04:11.940> then<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.120> should<00:04:13.360> tell<00:04:13.540> us<00:04:13.690> that

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
weeks then that should tell us that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.890 
weeks then that should tell us that
things<00:04:14.050> are<00:04:14.290> really<00:04:14.800> really<00:04:15.370> starting<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.750> get

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
things are really really starting to get

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.380 
things are really really starting to get
going<00:04:17.290> with<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:18.010> market<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.090> thank<00:04:19.299> you

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
going with in this market so thank you
