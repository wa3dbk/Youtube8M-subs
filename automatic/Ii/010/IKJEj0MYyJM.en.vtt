00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
had to be under enormous pressure yes

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970

the eyes of the world are upon her you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
the eyes of the world are upon her you
know<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> pressure<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
know and that's a lot of pressure and I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
know and that's a lot of pressure and I
don't<00:00:58.350> must<00:00:58.649> equate<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.609> two

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
don't must equate that to about two

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't must equate that to about two
strokes<00:01:00.690> per<00:01:00.960> round<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.440> her<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> two

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
strokes per round for her so for the two

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
strokes per round for her so for the two
days<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.570> might<00:01:03.690> add<00:01:03.930> four<00:01:04.290> strokes<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
days you might add four strokes for that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880 
days you might add four strokes for that
and<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> know<00:01:05.880> she<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.360> five<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> if

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and you know she was five over and if

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
and you know she was five over and if
you<00:01:07.979> take<00:01:08.159> away<00:01:08.220> those<00:01:08.790> four<00:01:09.090> strokes<00:01:09.510> which

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you take away those four strokes which

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
you take away those four strokes which
is<00:01:09.960> two<00:01:10.140> strokes<00:01:10.439> per<00:01:10.650> round<00:01:10.860> she<00:01:11.130> might<00:01:11.280> have

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
is two strokes per round she might have

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
is two strokes per round she might have
made<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> cut<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> without<00:01:12.600> all

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
made the cut with all that without all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
made the cut with all that without all
that<00:01:12.900> pressure<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> she<00:01:13.860> would<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.070> made<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that pressure and she would have made it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
that pressure and she would have made it
anyway<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.580> she<00:01:14.670> hit<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> couple<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> birdie

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
anyway if she hit a couple of the birdie

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260 
anyway if she hit a couple of the birdie
putts<00:01:16.100> which<00:01:17.100> mighty<00:01:17.700> help<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.119> too

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
putts which mighty help there too

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.730 
putts which mighty help there too
because<00:01:18.420> she<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.110> number<00:01:19.710> three

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
because she was actually number three

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
because she was actually number three
out<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.340> hundred<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> eleven<00:01:20.790> men<00:01:21.210> folks

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
out of a hundred and eleven men folks

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
out of a hundred and eleven men folks
she<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.320> number<00:01:22.530> three<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.009> far<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.340> finding

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
she was number three as far as finding

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.240 
she was number three as far as finding
the<00:01:23.909> fairway<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.479> she<00:01:24.720> found<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.290> fairway<00:01:25.470> she

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the fairway so she found the fairway she

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.859 
the fairway so she found the fairway she
was<00:01:26.400> good<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.670> greens<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> regulation<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
was good in greens and regulation I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.999 
was good in greens and regulation I
think<00:01:27.900> she<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> middle<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> pack

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
think she about the middle of the pack

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
think she about the middle of the pack
and<00:01:29.250> her<00:01:29.340> putting<00:01:29.670> was<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.090> great<00:01:30.360> she<00:01:30.509> was

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and her putting was not great she was

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
and her putting was not great she was
near<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> bottom<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
near the bottom and that but like you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
near the bottom and that but like you
said<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.390> where<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.259> tension

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
said you know that's where that tension

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.819 
said you know that's where that tension
can<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.159> play<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> role<00:01:36.140> yeah<00:01:37.170> Annika

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
can really play a role yeah Annika

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
can really play a role yeah Annika
definitely<00:01:38.250> hits<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> fairways<00:01:38.700> but

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
definitely hits a lot of fairways but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.690 
definitely hits a lot of fairways but
her<00:01:40.140> putting<00:01:40.409> gets<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:40.979> suspect<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
her putting gets a little suspect I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
her putting gets a little suspect I
think<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.210> hurt<00:01:42.390> her<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.280> tournament

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
think it hurt her for this tournament

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
think it hurt her for this tournament
but<00:01:44.369> also<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> nerves<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
but also when the nerves are up it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
but also when the nerves are up it
definitely<00:01:47.520> affects<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.049> small

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
definitely affects more of the small

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950 
definitely affects more of the small
muscles<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.579> affect<00:01:50.970> putti<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.780> than

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
muscles which affect putti more so than

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
muscles which affect putti more so than
the<00:01:52.049> big<00:01:52.229> muscles<00:01:52.680> which<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:53.070> affected<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the big muscles which will affected in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.899 
the big muscles which will affected in
the<00:01:53.729> fairways<00:01:54.259> yeah<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> duration

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the fairways yeah and and the duration

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
the fairways yeah and and the duration
of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> pressure<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.020> start<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.619> Thursday

pressure just didn't start Thursday
morning<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.510> mean<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.780> was

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
morning I mean this was

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.809 
morning I mean this was
building<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.840> weeks<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.470> weeks<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.489> she<00:02:15.549> was

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
building for weeks and weeks so she was

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.789 
building for weeks and weeks so she was
feeling<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> pressure<00:02:16.319> for<00:02:17.319> probably<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
feeling the pressure for probably a

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.520 
feeling the pressure for probably a
month<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.849> just<00:02:19.030> ended<00:02:19.420> Friday<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.230> I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
month and it just ended Friday but I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.140 
month and it just ended Friday but I
don't<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.459> say<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.909> pressure

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
don't think to say that the pressure

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.360 
don't think to say that the pressure
started<00:02:22.720> Thursday<00:02:22.900> morning<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.709> appropriate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
started Thursday morning is appropriate

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.740 
started Thursday morning is appropriate

really being able to train her body to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580 
really being able to train her body to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
it doesn't work for me and I'm not

it doesn't work for me and I'm not
playing<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:49.389> tournaments<00:03:50.159> so<00:03:51.159> in<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.870> you

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
playing in tournaments so in this do you

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.500 
playing in tournaments so in this do you
think<00:03:53.139> if<00:03:53.530> she<00:03:53.680> were<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.919> play<00:03:54.099> again<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:55.269> she

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
think if she were to play again that she

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.680 
think if she were to play again that she
would<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.810> fact<00:03:56.049> be<00:03:56.290> able<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:57.639> do<00:03:57.790> better<00:03:58.060> now

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
would in fact be able to do better now

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.110 
would in fact be able to do better now
that<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.229> out<00:03:59.349> of<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.530> way<00:03:59.680> oh<00:04:00.060> yeah<00:04:01.060> you

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
that this is out of the way oh yeah you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.110 
that this is out of the way oh yeah you

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.689 
know on Thursday it showed she beat 27
of<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.659> greatest<00:04:05.019> golfers<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:06.280> world

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
of the greatest golfers in the world

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.409 
of the greatest golfers in the world
she<00:04:07.180> beat<00:04:07.389> Sergio<00:04:07.840> Garcia<00:04:08.379> she<00:04:09.159> beat<00:04:09.430> Tom

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
she beat Sergio Garcia she beat Tom

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.719 
she beat Sergio Garcia she beat Tom
Lehman<00:04:10.659> Appleby<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.680> Tom<00:04:12.069> Lehman<00:04:12.310> British

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
Lehman Appleby and Tom Lehman British

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.089 
Lehman Appleby and Tom Lehman British
Open<00:04:13.060> champ<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:13.870> showed<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.829> any

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
Open champ and it showed that on any

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.979 
Open champ and it showed that on any
given<00:04:15.250> day<00:04:15.549> she<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.299> compete<00:04:16.570> with<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.810> men

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
given day she can compete with the men

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.009 
given day she can compete with the men
so<00:04:17.199> I<00:04:17.260> think<00:04:17.349> if<00:04:17.739> she<00:04:18.099> plays<00:04:18.340> again<00:04:18.789> her<00:04:19.539> nerves

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
so I think if she plays again her nerves

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.990 
so I think if she plays again her nerves
will<00:04:20.289> subside<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.159> think<00:04:21.430> she'll<00:04:21.639> actually

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
will subside and I think she'll actually

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.029 
will subside and I think she'll actually
make<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.240> cut<00:04:22.450> all<00:04:22.870> right<00:04:23.139> well<00:04:23.440> hopefully

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
make the cut all right well hopefully

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.320 
make the cut all right well hopefully
we'll<00:04:24.340> see<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.639> don't<00:04:24.760> know<00:04:24.849> exactly<00:04:24.940> what

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
we'll see we don't know exactly what

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.230 
we'll see we don't know exactly what
she's<00:04:25.479> gonna<00:04:25.599> do

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
she's gonna do

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.820 
she's gonna do
