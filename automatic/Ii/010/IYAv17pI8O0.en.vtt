 hello everyone and welcome today we are going to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.410
 make this bracelet that I had 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.720
 requested a long time ago and there was 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.730
 could do it but good here and the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.189
 we have this bracelet we can make 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.439
 to give as gifts we can also 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.599
 make it to sell there are many people who 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.000
 he has asked me for things to sell so 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.580
 this can serve you well so stay 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.430
 watch this video with me subscribe if still 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.440
 they have not done it and share this video and 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.750
 here we have the rings ready 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.130
 to see how to prepare the rings 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.130
 I leave the link in the description well 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.500
 let's use wire in this case 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.930
 used 'normal' wire 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.170
 ironmongery we start with the wire to 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.570
 about 5 centimeters of this one let's do 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.830
 a ring so with the clamp 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.560
 molding round tips we are going to 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.980
 help us to make a ring of this 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.130
 way and we already have a ring we have 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.740
 this excess that is the one that we are going to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.000
 add to the ring now we take the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.159
 ring and put the wire in the part 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.579
 where it was more redondita 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.950
 in this way and now we are going to fix the 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.350
 wire to the ring so we give it a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.869
 couple of laps we helped each other with a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.270
 clamp so that it is quite fixed and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.100
 tight and once we have given 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 a couple of laps we can cut 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.960
 and this surplus we are going to press him well 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.260
 so that it does not stay up and can not 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.230
 hurt or hurt them 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.420
 hold on to clothes and so on so 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.000
 let's crush how good we have the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.680
 first part grabbed the girl now 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260
 let's do it with the second part 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.210
 let's do the same simply that 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.140
 in this case the wire will be much more 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.510
 long let's give it a couple of laps 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.340
 fixing the wire to the ring of the other 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.050
 side is also important is that the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.050
 wire is not so thick to be able 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.060
 work it and we already have the wire 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.400
 fixed to the ring now let's 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.950
 start adding the accounts so 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.580
 let's take an account we put it in 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.580
 the wire 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.319
 we make the account stay in the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.439
 hole in the ring and we will give the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.749
 turn the wire wrapping the other 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.420
 side of the ring we help ourselves with a 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:40.599
 clamp to pull with a turn is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.549
 enough we already have an account with a 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.799
 ring now let's add the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.470
 next ring putting the wire in 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.510
 the girl 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.360
 this way we take it with the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.350
 others and the wire we wrap it like this 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.110
 just like that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.110
 and the ring is already added 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.490
 if we add the following account 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.430
 we put the wire around the other 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.430
 end of the ring and throw 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.930
 we have the following ring 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 we wrap like this 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.129
 I like to use wire since with 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.410
 wrap and press we have it fixed 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.810
 because if we do it with thread this thread 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.640
 it is loose does not keep the form 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.050
 instead the wire if then we go to 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.599
 continue adding the rings 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.489
 necessary for the bracelet once 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.890
 we have added all the amount of 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.400
 rings and accounts necessary to have 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.739
 the bracelet we will do the same as 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.930
 we did at the beginning at the end we're going to 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.440
 make a ring then for this 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.920
 first let's adjust the wire well 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.459
 and with the help of the molding clamp of 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.079
 round tips we make a ring and 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.239
 once we have the ring, then the 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.250
 another tip we wrap in the other 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.450
 part of the ring does not need to be done 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.700
 too many guards we cut the excess 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.799
 once we have this we are going to 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.769
 do in the top part we're going to 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.000
 put rings to join the rings like this 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.250
 between the two rings we add one 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.639
 ring and ready we have added all 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.790
 the rings on top and by 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.330
 last we only have to add the 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.680
 close or mosquito for that we're also going 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.680
 to use a ring 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.100
 and we have ready the bracelet we are going to 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.169
 shape it and the other side does not make us 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.910
 missing add ring because as 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.479
 we made the ring with the wire 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.020
 We are already formed and here 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.150
 we have our ring wristband with 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 accounts at the end of the video I leave more 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.260
 Recycle tutorials with rings like this 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.380
 they just have to click on the 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.240
 picture and take it directly to the video 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.669
 nothing else, this is all for today 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.560
 I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.720
 you also do it and see you in 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.720
 the next video until next time 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.949
 and 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.530
 Y 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.720
 and fair
