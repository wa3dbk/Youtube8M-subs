00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so this is our first look at the mat-su

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.880 
so this is our first look at the mat-su

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
tech HP 33a which is an a a is

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.669 
tech HP 33a which is an a a is
transponder<00:00:07.890> Class<00:00:08.160> B<00:00:08.370> transponder<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
transponder Class B transponder and

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.090 
transponder Class B transponder and
integrated<00:00:10.679> with<00:00:10.950> its<00:00:11.460> own<00:00:11.790> GPS<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.250> with

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
integrated with its own GPS and with

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.189 
integrated with its own GPS and with
with<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> GPS<00:00:17.640> display<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.420> not<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
with the GPS display but not not as a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.210 
with the GPS display but not not as a
chart<00:00:19.470> plotter<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:22.170> box<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.980> have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
chart plotter so in the box we have

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
chart plotter so in the box we have
quite<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.880> extensive<00:00:24.650> operational<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
quite an extensive operational and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.820 
quite an extensive operational and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
installation manual and which wasn't

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
installation manual and which wasn't
visible<00:00:29.189> online<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.359> quite

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
visible online so that's quite

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.350

for<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> GPS<00:01:53.670> antenna<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:57.890> not<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.310> come

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
for the GPS antenna so not much as come

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
for the GPS antenna so not much as come
out<00:02:00.270> yet<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> internet<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.200> these<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
out yet on the internet about these and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.990 
out yet on the internet about these and
they're<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.369> value<00:02:02.700> seemingly<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
they're very good value seemingly so and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.340 
they're very good value seemingly so and
I'll<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.210> look<00:02:06.360> later<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.990> powered

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I'll have a look later when we powered

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.500 
I'll have a look later when we powered
up
