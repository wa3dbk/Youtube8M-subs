views<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.849> night<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.070> thought<00:00:29.070> that's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
views in one night so I thought that's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.120 
views in one night so I thought that's
pretty<00:00:29.550> darn<00:00:29.820> epic<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:31.080> we're<00:00:31.710> doing<00:00:31.830> another

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pretty darn epic so we're doing another

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.340 
pretty darn epic so we're doing another
one<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.120> quickly<00:00:33.390> set<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
one so I'm gonna quickly set the time to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
one so I'm gonna quickly set the time to
zero<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> mean

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
zero to one I mean

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.310 
zero to one I mean
and<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.610> glitch<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.540> invisibility

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and so this glitch is the invisibility

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.389 
and so this glitch is the invisibility
glitch<00:00:40.829> which<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.579> allow<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:43.370> troll<00:00:44.370> your

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
glitch which can allow you to troll your

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
completely hidden and invisible so the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.590 
completely hidden and invisible so the
first<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.670> might<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> already<00:00:51.390> seen

lever and then you click it again and
your<00:02:19.989> boat<00:02:20.200> should<00:02:20.440> end<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.799> like<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.250> then

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
your boat should end up like that then

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
your boat should end up like that then
you<00:02:22.269> break<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.780> lever<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.440> then<00:02:24.069> right-click

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
you break the lever and then right-click

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.330 
you break the lever and then right-click
on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.819> boat<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> are<00:02:26.349> completely

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
on the boat now you are completely

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.289 
on the boat now you are completely
submerged<00:02:28.319> inside<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.120> piston

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
submerged inside of the piston

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.509 
submerged inside of the piston
you're<00:02:31.599> completely<00:02:31.840> invisible<00:02:32.319> sort<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.370> like

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
you're completely invisible sort of like

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.870 
you're completely invisible sort of like
the<00:02:33.610> other<00:02:33.700> one<00:02:34.319> but<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.650> time<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.849> can

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the other one but this time you can

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.220 
the other one but this time you can
actually<00:02:37.599> shoot<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.290> bow<00:02:38.739> out<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.690> mean

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
actually shoot a bow out of it so I mean

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.210 
actually shoot a bow out of it so I mean
that<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.860> epic<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.120> honest<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.220> some

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
that is just epic to be honest and some

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.539 
that is just epic to be honest and some
places<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.360> go<00:02:47.290> make<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.340> play

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
places you can go make up you can play

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.819 
places you can go make up you can play
you<00:02:48.819> can<00:02:48.970> shoot<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.299> anywhere<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.230> let's<00:02:50.650> try

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
you can shoot it anywhere so let's try

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can shoot it anywhere so let's try
and<00:02:50.920> kill<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.129> tower<00:02:51.400> right<00:02:51.640> here<00:02:51.900> we're

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
and kill this tower right here we're

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.190 
and kill this tower right here we're
trying<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.410> cowl<00:02:53.620> right<00:02:53.860> now<00:02:54.120> dies<00:02:55.200> you're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
trying this cowl right now dies you're

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.270 
trying this cowl right now dies you're
about<00:02:56.410> you're<00:02:57.010> about<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.310> die<00:02:58.980> where<00:02:59.980> are<00:03:00.129> you

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
about you're about to die where are you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.140 
about you're about to die where are you
can<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:01.780> clicked<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.230> well<00:03:03.160> anyway<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:03.730> that's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
can get clicked on well anyway so that's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.119 
can get clicked on well anyway so that's
the<00:03:04.299> second<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.349> basically<00:03:05.769> just

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
the second one and you basically just

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.390 
the second one and you basically just
click<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.639> left<00:03:06.880> shift<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.569> out<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
click the left shift to get out of this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.920 
click the left shift to get out of this
and<00:03:09.400> look<00:03:09.579> how<00:03:09.700> discreet<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.329> looks<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.750> just

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
and look how discreet it looks it's just

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.509 
and look how discreet it looks it's just
a<00:03:11.049> piston<00:03:11.530> that's<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.639> so<00:03:14.310> unfortunately<00:03:15.310> it's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
a piston that's it so unfortunately it's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.800 
a piston that's it so unfortunately it's
an<00:03:15.579> only<00:03:15.970> one<00:03:16.209> time<00:03:16.569> use<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:19.329> have<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.660> go

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
an only one time use so you have to go

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.500 
an only one time use so you have to go
underneath<00:03:20.019> get<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.620> boat<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.819> then<00:03:22.030> break

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
underneath get the boat and then break

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050 
underneath get the boat and then break
weight<00:03:23.019> after<00:03:23.200> break<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.920> then<00:03:24.519> what

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
weight after break that and then what

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.910 
weight after break that and then what
it's<00:03:25.209> easily<00:03:25.599> reset<00:03:26.019> because<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.650> use

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
it's easily reset because you just use

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.000 
it's easily reset because you just use
all<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> items<00:03:27.760> again<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.630> put<00:03:28.840> there<00:03:29.049> put

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
all the items again you put there put

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
all the items again you put there put
the<00:03:30.609> lever<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:31.419> put<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.690> boat<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.139> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the lever there put the boat there and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.110 
the lever there put the boat there and
you<00:03:34.930> sometimes<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.919> glitches<00:03:36.519> out<00:03:36.639> a<00:03:36.700> bit<00:03:36.970> like

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
you sometimes it glitches out a bit like

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.729 
you sometimes it glitches out a bit like
this<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:38.769> have<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.220> just<00:03:39.400> reset<00:03:39.970> it

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
this and so you have to just reset it

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.089 
this and so you have to just reset it
oh<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.690> think<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.169> know<00:03:44.230> what<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> problem<00:03:45.010> is

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
oh I think I know what the problem is

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.800 
oh I think I know what the problem is
here<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.849> have<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.150> place<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.599> different

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
here you have to place it in a different

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.949 
here you have to place it in a different
place<00:03:47.290> -<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.310> last<00:03:48.519> time<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.940> did<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.239> so

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
place - the last time you did it so

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.670 
place - the last time you did it so
let's<00:03:50.290> try<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.760> let's<00:03:51.760> see<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.230> when<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.410> add

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
let's try that let's see if when you add

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.250 
let's try that let's see if when you add
it<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.220> moved<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:56.099> leave<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.130> boom<00:03:59.609> and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
it I moved it leave a boom and

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.229 
it I moved it leave a boom and
there<00:04:03.260> we<00:04:03.349> go<00:04:03.469> yeah<00:04:04.189> you<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.790> place<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.030> in

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
there we go yeah you have to place it in

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.780 
there we go yeah you have to place it in
a<00:04:05.269> different<00:04:05.540> place<00:04:06.019> every<00:04:06.290> time<00:04:06.829> we<00:04:07.459> can<00:04:07.640> just

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
a different place every time we can just

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.849 
a different place every time we can just
move<00:04:07.969> it<00:04:08.150> one<00:04:08.329> block<00:04:08.540> along<00:04:08.930> if<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.140> want<00:04:09.260> so

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
move it one block along if you want so

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.449 
move it one block along if you want so
and<00:04:10.640> then<00:04:10.819> you<00:04:10.939> just<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:12.379> the

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
and then you just get in your in the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.670 
and then you just get in your in the
piston<00:04:13.659> completely<00:04:14.659> submerged<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.439> then<00:04:15.560> you

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
piston completely submerged and then you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.449 
piston completely submerged and then you
can<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:16.160> shoot<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:16.609> tower<00:04:16.910> right<00:04:17.150> here<00:04:17.180> and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
can just shoot this tower right here and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.670 
can just shoot this tower right here and
bearing<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.549> mind<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.660> game<00:04:20.989> thinks<00:04:21.500> you're

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
bearing in mind the game thinks you're

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.370 
bearing in mind the game thinks you're
standing<00:04:22.160> up<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.550> if<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.759> aim<00:04:23.000> here<00:04:23.330> it'll<00:04:24.050> go

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
standing up so if I aim here it'll go

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.040 
standing up so if I aim here it'll go
above<00:04:25.160> where<00:04:25.490> I'm<00:04:25.699> actually<00:04:25.820> shooting<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.960> you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
above where I'm actually shooting so you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.460 
above where I'm actually shooting so you
have<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.289> aim<00:04:27.470> lower<00:04:28.190> down<00:04:28.990> for<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.259> shoot

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
have to aim lower down for it to shoot

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.300 
have to aim lower down for it to shoot
where<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.770> want<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:32.410> there<00:04:33.410> are<00:04:33.590> two<00:04:33.740> glitches
