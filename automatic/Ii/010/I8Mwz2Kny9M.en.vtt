00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Harbinger it's possible to search up

Harbinger it's possible to search up
another<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:56.030> not<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> fastest<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.809> better

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059

work<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.700> instead<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> contact<00:01:06.270> him

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
work and instead not to contact him

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
work and instead not to contact him
probe<00:01:06.689> into<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.590> turn<00:01:07.820> as

probe into it that for that turn as
either<00:01:09.590> obviously<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> risk<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.189> him

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
either obviously this is a risk of him

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600 
either obviously this is a risk of him
removing<00:01:11.909> from<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.180> hand<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.610> potentially

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
removing from my hand so potentially

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
removing from my hand so potentially
better<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> wait<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.720> he<00:01:16.220> drops

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
better just to wait here he drops

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
better just to wait here he drops
another<00:01:17.400> gap<00:01:17.729> tarmogoyf<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.740> puts<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.800 
instant swells that we can play that he
hits<00:01:27.720> us<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.049> six<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.450> maybe<00:01:30.570> should<00:01:30.780> have

hits us for six and maybe should have

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.420 
hits us for six and maybe should have

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
blocked with the flanking Harbinger

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
blocked with the flanking Harbinger
there<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.570> concerned<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> year

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
there but I was concerned about a year

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
there but I was concerned about a year
liliana<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> why<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.090> trying<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> play

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
liliana which is why was trying to play

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
liliana which is why was trying to play
around<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.890> liliana<00:01:37.890> coming<00:01:38.250> down<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
around there liliana coming down and the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.120 
around there liliana coming down and the
minus<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:39.780> wing<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> kill<00:01:40.259> off<00:01:40.350> my<00:01:40.500> name<00:01:40.650> Vegas

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.440 

so<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> plays<00:01:44.369> an<00:01:44.460> engineered<00:01:44.909> explosives

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so you plays an engineered explosives

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.730 
so you plays an engineered explosives
for<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> terrible<00:01:47.700> position

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
for one which is in a terrible position

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.319 
for one which is in a terrible position
obviously<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.520> attack<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.210> probably

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
obviously we attack which we probably

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
obviously we attack which we probably
shouldn't<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.720> done<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.200> either<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.130> he's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
shouldn't have done but either way he's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.060 
shouldn't have done but either way he's
gable<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> kill<00:01:53.909> them<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.770> drop<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.799> kiln

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
gable to kill them off drop my kiln

gable to kill them off drop my kiln

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
fiend and the take to fall down to fall

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.139 
fiend and the take to fall down to fall
probably<00:02:05.280> should<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.490> left<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.790> creatures

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
probably should have left my creatures

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
probably should have left my creatures
and<00:02:06.299> untapped<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.110> least<00:02:07.229> we'd<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and untapped so at least we'd have to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.510 
and untapped so at least we'd have to
kill<00:02:07.890> them<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.819> turn<00:02:09.060> butter<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.370> the<00:02:11.370> least

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
kill them that turn butter and the least

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.770 
kill them that turn butter and the least
and<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.180> kill<00:02:12.330> his<00:02:12.420> death<00:02:12.599> right

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and that would kill his death right

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.600 
and that would kill his death right
