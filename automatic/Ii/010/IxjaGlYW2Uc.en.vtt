00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.490
 as you already know a lot of employment about 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.260
 all the majority are being erased or 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.600
 eliminated so it is already difficult for 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.269
 you can see it and they have gone to the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.800
 light enough enough weapons I'm going to 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.140
 say here all the weapons that have been 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.599
 seen and such and I will say trying to see 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.550
 more things of everything to keep saying 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.749

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.970
 anything goes 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.519

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.039
 well let's get enough 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.219
 quite a lot of things worth 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.170
 and we go with all the weapons or almost all 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.190

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.219
 that basically will only fix on airplanes and 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.799
 all kinds of things you already know what is 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:32.170

 the arms the reflex sight looks at kof 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.450
 -the target finder which is basically what 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 that has come out as far as it has gone 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.549
 that fixed the targets red and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.590
 will join hybrid suppressor that is basically 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.509
 the oppressors the fast muffler more 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.670
 that will be fast chargers because if 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 Double workers or so for 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.519
 the grip that will be the I think the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.370
 laser handle that is the laser looks like 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.680
 that we will have an adjustable laser this 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.739
 which I suppose will be an adjustable sight and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.420
 such we will have to mind the grenades the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.280
 selector of ratio of shots already 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.090
 you know to put a bullet three shots 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.700
 or more shots that will be had is main

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.670
 aimed bullets tip 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.410
 and I think he did not leave anything else 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 I will try to come with the advantages and such 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.180
 with everything I 've seen so strange that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.490
 surely it will cost me a chicken 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.840
 and nothing this has been all kids and we 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.080
