the SSD we've got an agility 3 for the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.230 
the SSD we've got an agility 3 for the
SSD<00:02:16.550> okay<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.820> that's<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.690> components<00:02:20.240> let's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
SSD okay so that's the components let's

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.490 
SSD okay so that's the components let's
put<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.600> together<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.990> see<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.320> looks

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
put it together and see what it looks

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.670 
put it together and see what it looks
like

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.330 

okay<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:26.640> we've<00:02:26.969> got<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:28.159> computer<00:02:29.159> together

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
okay so we've got the computer together

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.119 
okay so we've got the computer together
nice<00:02:32.340> black<00:02:32.909> finish<00:02:33.769> let's<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> look<00:02:35.069> at
