00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.410 
that would be the colored pool you know
me<00:03:13.650> nor<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.040> gay<00:03:14.340> pool<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.940> see<00:03:15.090> them<00:03:15.209> saying

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
me nor the gay pool you see them saying

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.800 
me nor the gay pool you see them saying
yeah

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
yeah

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.360 
yeah
so<00:03:15.989> i<00:03:16.230> guess<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.799> better<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.160> just

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
so i guess it's better to just

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.220 
so i guess it's better to just
completely<00:03:17.880> exclude<00:03:18.480> them<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.720> treat<00:03:19.049> them

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
completely exclude them and treat them

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.050 
completely exclude them and treat them
like<00:03:19.260> crap<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.829> for<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.160> even<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> second

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
like crap so for not even for a second

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
like crap so for not even for a second
would<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.329> think<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:22.260> belong<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.950> this
