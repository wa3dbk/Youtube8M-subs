feel these cool challenges that would
make<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.630> seems<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:16.199> where<00:00:16.350> they

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
make that just seems to see where they

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250 
make that just seems to see where they

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
minutes and 45 seconds so I believe we

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
minutes and 45 seconds so I believe we
can<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:27.240> probably<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:27.660> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
can do this we will probably make some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
can do this we will probably make some
mistakes<00:00:28.170> along<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.849> these

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
mistakes along the way now you get these

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
mistakes along the way now you get these
Swit<00:00:30.359> parts<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.529> top<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.210> recommend

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Swit parts here of the top I recommend

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.850 
Swit parts here of the top I recommend
taking<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.570> rap<00:00:33.780> part<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.620> seems

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
taking the rap part because that seems

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.380 
taking the rap part because that seems
to<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:34.980> shorter<00:00:35.430> I'll<00:00:35.910> show<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> left

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to be shorter I'll show you the left

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.729 
to be shorter I'll show you the left
part<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.930> will<00:00:37.200> show<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
part I will show you that you can

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.850 
part I will show you that you can
actually<00:00:37.890> take<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> part<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> still<00:00:39.860> get

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
actually take that part and still get

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.090 
actually take that part and still get
gold<00:00:41.540> because<00:00:42.540> you're<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> good<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
gold because you're just that good a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.119 
gold because you're just that good a
driver<00:00:44.870> even<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.020> mistakes<00:00:46.500> even<00:00:46.829> though<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
driver even make mistakes even though we

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
driver even make mistakes even though we
had<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> weird<00:00:47.670> load<00:00:48.000> reload<00:00:48.930> respawn<00:00:49.680> thing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
had that weird load reload respawn thing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
had that weird load reload respawn thing
happen<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.520> start<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> crash<00:00:51.780> means<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
happen at the start and crash means that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
happen at the start and crash means that
I<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.440> crashing<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.920> wall<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.280> going

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I was crashing to the wall was going

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.250 
I was crashing to the wall was going
this<00:00:53.640> direction<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.530> don't<00:00:56.340> recommend<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
this direction so I don't recommend it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
this direction so I don't recommend it
just<00:00:58.260> built<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.800> feels<00:00:59.190> longer<00:00:59.730> whether<00:00:59.969> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
just built it feels longer whether it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
just built it feels longer whether it
actually<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.170> sure<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.699> pretty

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
actually is I'm not sure but I'm pretty

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.289 
actually is I'm not sure but I'm pretty
sure<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:05.040> I've<00:01:05.780> 80%<00:01:06.780> certain<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sure that I've 80% certain that it is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.350 
sure that I've 80% certain that it is
slightly<00:01:10.020> longer<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.400> let's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
slightly longer going that way so let's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
slightly longer going that way so let's
keep<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.200> boos<00:01:13.409> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
keep on going get all these boos do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
keep on going get all these boos do
stuff<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.880> trick<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.390> want<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> keep<00:01:15.780> build

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
stuff do trick if you want to keep build

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
stuff do trick if you want to keep build
up<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.229> turbo<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.890> drift<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:18.299> stunts

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
up your turbo just drift and do stunts

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
up your turbo just drift and do stunts
if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> feel<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.340> tracks<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> bit

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
if you feel like it the tracks a bit

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.710 
if you feel like it the tracks a bit
sloppy<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> risky<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.630> any

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
sloppy so it's kind of risky to do any

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
sloppy so it's kind of risky to do any
stunts<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> stuff<00:01:25.549> just<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
stunts and stuff just you know just

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
stunts and stuff just you know just
drive<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.530> we're<00:01:28.619> doing<00:01:28.860> who's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
drive that's what we're doing who's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.069 
drive that's what we're doing who's
gonna<00:01:29.280> drive<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.939> gonna<00:01:30.479> win<00:01:31.159> you're<00:01:32.159> like

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
gonna drive I'm gonna win you're like

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.520 
gonna drive I'm gonna win you're like
just<00:01:34.079> almost<00:01:34.500> four<00:01:35.220> minutes<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.909> win<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> race

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
just almost four minutes to win a race

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
just almost four minutes to win a race
so<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> believe<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.670> tracks

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so I believe we can do this tracks

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
so I believe we can do this tracks
pretty<00:01:39.570> easy<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> wide<00:01:40.850> unless<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
pretty easy it's kind of wide unless you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
pretty easy it's kind of wide unless you
fall<00:01:42.180> off<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.659> don't<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.170> happens<00:01:43.409> if

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
fall off I don't know what happens if

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
fall off I don't know what happens if
you<00:01:43.590> fall<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.159> assume<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> fall<00:01:45.000> off

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you fall off I assume if you fall off

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770 
you fall off I assume if you fall off
you<00:01:45.329> respawn<00:01:46.250> well<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.549> hope<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you respawn well I would hope you to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.170 
you respawn well I would hope you to
respawn<00:01:49.110> where<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> fall<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> would

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
respawn where you fall off but I would

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660 
respawn where you fall off but I would
these<00:01:51.299> tracks<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.799> don't

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
these tracks I just don't know I don't

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
these tracks I just don't know I don't
think<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.740> reckon<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> would

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
think you would I reckon you would

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
think you would I reckon you would
respawn<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> closest<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> track<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
respawn to the closest for the track so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.030 
respawn to the closest for the track so
if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> fall<00:01:58.229> from<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> top<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> very

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
