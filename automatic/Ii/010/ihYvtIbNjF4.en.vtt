00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
 run the kibiz 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.550
 whole and when not 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.770
 were presented kinopolis pour 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 Giant anticipation and big 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.290
 hope with the fans of hsg wetzlar 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.660
 the long time champion from keel very early in 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.090
 the season to guest in central Hesse and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.650
 the engine of the North German so far still 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.840
 not really on the tour 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.300
 green-white so with the confidence that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.310
 the zebras would be vulnerable 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 Wetzlar, however, lacked four 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.350
 including a new player 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.360
 maximilian wood on the left side because of 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.579
 a serious knee injury long 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.710
 will fail 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.750
 in the initial phase it was initially a 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.879
 defensive battle rarely found the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.550
 Team the right gap like here 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.559
 in this scene christian hull the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.070
 goalkeeper duel already decided in this 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.780
 phase hsg keeper andi wolf for himself the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.900
 national player could among other things 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.420
 defuse a seven-yard was against 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.930
 but often the kieler's world-wide selection 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.120
 Robinson has just no chance 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.790
 a really strong day caught nine 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.189
 gates in total the norwegian always 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.350
 playable always dangerous prepared 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.880
 the kieler defense similar headache 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 the after a durchzechten partynacht 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.540
 after 15 minutes and this hit of 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.119
 hsg superstar ivano balic got it in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.549
 a balanced game five to five 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.610
 but shortly before the break, the 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.220
 zebras then a gang high wetzlar 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.009
 Doubled in attack the ball kiel with 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.770
 the raid- like counter- attack and niclas 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 ekberg worried the 10 to 8 leadership for 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.939
 the guests 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.250
 but also thanks to the brilliant moments of 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.590
 ex welthandballer balitsch left the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.960
 green-white not after balitsch behind 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.140
 back to loud wetzlar at half-time 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.740
 only with 13 15 in arrears 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.289
 more than 4200 spectators in the Rittal 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.810
 arena had a lot of fun with the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.150
 occurs to your team at the same time 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.120
 beginning of the second half were standing 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.550
 the boys of the hsg but even in the way in 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.890
 outnumber a trapped pass from small 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.020
 and the three gates lead for keel 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 the technical errors in the game structure 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.500
 should now be the sticking point for the HSG 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.450
 become 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
 the Middle Hessians could be in this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 phase with your goalkeeper thanks andy 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.880
 Wolf kept the HSG in the lot and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.890
 After this fight the lightning after 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.959
 confidently completes the hsg 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.500
 suddenly again up to two hits 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.540
 in the hall on the hope germinated 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.580
 but then it got hectic on the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.770
 parquet after a storm foul against 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.000
 TÃ¶nnesen saw Hsg-trainer Wandschneider 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.970
 the yellow card 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 The hall raged in this unrest 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.500
 the zebras stayed cool as one 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.720
 Hundeschnauze moved away again and 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.110
 secured a happy one in the end 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.110
 32 to 29 away win 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.930
 like that, not quite done 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.060
 I think we had to fight failures 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.070
 after all, we went to complain 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.200
 German master played and therefore 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.239
 is always pretty disappointed and need 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.390
 state that we then in the conclusion 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.180
 leave was too much next game 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.350
 It's going to be as hard as I am now 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.519
 Guess you saw that today 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.500
 are now in the constitution 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.600
 to keep up with every opponent and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.250
 drive to hamburg around points 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.019
 pick up 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.380
 I think that was a game today 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.840
 have seen something 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.430
 I think that was very important to us 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.000
 away is difficult itself 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.370
 been 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.010
 for us have not brought any counter 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.570
 that that is all the happier that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.120
 people have taken the two points 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.200
 I think it was crucial that we were in 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.210
 the defensive stood together as 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.070
 team works very well 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.870
 We have to take this step 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.770
 go back to where we are 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.090
 last year were 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.720
 and there we want to go back 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.720
 at the top
