00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
thumb drive and in the way it is but

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.839 
thumb drive and in the way it is but
it's<00:00:13.380> much<00:00:13.620> more<00:00:13.860> than<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.460> what's

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
it's much more than that really what's

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.829 
it's much more than that really what's
inside<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.330> here

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839

basically<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.590> looking<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.310> send<00:00:20.550> force

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
basically we're looking at a send force

basically we're looking at a send force
controller<00:00:21.270> we're<00:00:21.660> looking<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.140> popular

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
controller we're looking at popular

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.210 
controller we're looking at popular
rangeland<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.180> USB<00:00:24.539> 3<00:00:24.930> interface<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
rangeland and a USB 3 interface and the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
rangeland and a USB 3 interface and the
idea<00:00:26.580> behind<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.119> stick<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.050> enable

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
idea behind this stick is to enable

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
idea behind this stick is to enable
putting<00:00:29.160> Windows<00:00:29.519> 8<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.449> booting<00:00:30.869> off

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
putting Windows 8 on it and booting off

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.069 
putting Windows 8 on it and booting off
of<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.769> complete<00:00:32.160> system<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:33.300> fairly

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
of it the complete system a fairly

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.500 
of it the complete system a fairly
decent<00:00:34.260> worked<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.920> Microsoft<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> certify

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
decent worked with Microsoft to certify

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
decent worked with Microsoft to certify
this<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.710> viable<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> we're

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this to be viable for that and we're

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.030 
this to be viable for that and we're
just<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> demo<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.410> desktop

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
just about to get a demo of a desktop

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
just about to get a demo of a desktop
machine<00:00:41.160> booting<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> running

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
machine booting off of this and running

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
machine booting off of this and running
Windows<00:00:43.320> 8<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.129> there's<00:00:44.730> no<00:00:44.850> pricing

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Windows 8 off of this there's no pricing

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
Windows 8 off of this there's no pricing
but<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.530> available<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
but it's gonna be available when it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:00.439 
but it's gonna be available when it
windows<00:00:47.730> 8<00:00:47.879> ships<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.930> let's<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.320> ahead

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 

so<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> monitor<00:01:02.010> connected<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so here we have the monitor connected to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
so here we have the monitor connected to
the<00:01:02.789> desktop<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.539> turned<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the desktop we just turned on and in a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.800 
the desktop we just turned on and in a
few<00:01:05.549> seconds<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:05.970> should<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.330> able<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.570> see

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
few seconds we should be able to see

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
few seconds we should be able to see
Windows<00:01:07.470> 8<00:01:07.619> boot<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.490> what's<00:01:08.640> more

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
Windows 8 boot and what's more

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.080 
Windows 8 boot and what's more
interesting<00:01:09.149> is<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.290> happens<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.729> pull

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
interesting is what happens when we pull

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.030 
interesting is what happens when we pull
the<00:01:12.299> stick<00:01:12.600> while<00:01:12.960> windows<00:01:13.409> 8<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> running

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the stick while windows 8 is running

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
the stick while windows 8 is running
it's<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.909> relatively<00:01:15.299> failsafe<00:01:15.750> which

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's actually relatively failsafe which

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.149 
it's actually relatively failsafe which
is<00:01:16.619> pretty<00:01:16.799> interesting

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.740 

so<00:01:19.820> here<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.390> Windows<00:01:20.840> 8<00:01:20.960> green

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.140 

and<00:01:26.750> there<00:01:27.229> we<00:01:27.409> are<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.430> cool<00:01:28.640> thing<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.850> as

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
and there we are so the cool thing is as

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.749 
and there we are so the cool thing is as
soon<00:01:29.360> as<00:01:29.619> this<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.830> done<00:01:31.070> you'll<00:01:31.280> see<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.490> little

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
soon as this is done you'll see a little

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
soon as this is done you'll see a little
dialog<00:01:32.240> pops<00:01:32.509> up

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
dialog pops up

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
dialog pops up
so<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> tell<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.670> we're<00:01:35.880> told<00:01:36.149> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so as you can tell here we're told to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.770 
so as you can tell here we're told to
keep<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> USB<00:01:37.500> Drive<00:01:37.740> plugged<00:01:38.039> in<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
keep the USB Drive plugged in and this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
keep the USB Drive plugged in and this
is<00:01:39.840> obviously<00:01:40.469> for<00:01:40.890> obvious<00:01:41.130> reason<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> want

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
is obviously for obvious reason you want

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
is obviously for obvious reason you want
the<00:01:41.789> u.s.<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.149> running<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.780> Drive

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the u.s. is running off of this Drive

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.529 
the u.s. is running off of this Drive
but<00:01:43.680> here's<00:01:43.920> some<00:01:44.130> magic<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.820> we're<00:01:45.390> gonna

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
but here's some magic so we're gonna

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.740 
but here's some magic so we're gonna
we're<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.470> click<00:01:46.649> OK<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.750> now

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
we're gonna click OK on that and now

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.319 
we're gonna click OK on that and now
we're<00:01:48.929> gonna<00:01:49.020> pull<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> actual<00:01:50.130> drive<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
we're gonna pull the actual drive out of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.669 
we're gonna pull the actual drive out of
there<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.560> windows<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
there so there it is and windows is

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.520 
there so there it is and windows is
actually<00:01:56.159> still<00:01:56.490> running<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:58.020> mouse<00:01:58.289> cursor

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
actually still running the mouse cursor

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.169 
actually still running the mouse cursor
works<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.130> cetera<00:01:59.369> now<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> try<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> do

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
works at cetera now if you try to do

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.309 
works at cetera now if you try to do
something<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.729> freezes<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.479> but

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
something it just just freezes right but

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.210 
something it just just freezes right but
as<00:02:04.950> soon<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> drive<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
as soon as you put the drive back in to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.479 
as soon as you put the drive back in to
the<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> computer<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.340> the
