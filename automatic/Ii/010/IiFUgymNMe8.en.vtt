 happens in spiral places where the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.590
 machines and high technology is 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 really very present 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.340
 no but at the same time when there is some 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.080
 technology we know it's going to end 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.450
 just watch the movies from 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.520
 science fiction what a ball with there 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.280
 you have between an arcand de belleval and this 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.130
 powerful fighter machine the jaws 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.960
 it's not you I want 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.140
 pioneering onions what made it appear 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.530
 if away here is what it looks too 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.689
 cute if that's what their meaning is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.659
 even sins committed by the inhabitants 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.189
 the person nor fication hurry that me 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 okay 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.520
 they destroy their camps as well as 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.610
 all the machine towns and the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.130
 thieves for you nasty dragon monday 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.960
 that he a year later the mount 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.000
 now contains a lot of technology 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.489
 and its use and limit damage 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.200
 of a total - there the only way to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.209
 destroy sin and that a lawyer make a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.250
 pilgrimage around the world in order to 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.739
 take possession of chimeras and so 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 to invoke the ultimate chimera in order to 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.700
 to make disappear sign for a dozen 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 years because yes what we know well 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.830
 every ten years he is evil incarnate 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
 we go on the pilgrimage of yuna there a 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.940
 young man at the heart of 17 years as well as 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.920
 of her guardians so just she 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.110
 will love six women and he is too much 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
 you know what besides it's just 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.440
 a flying bliss champion it looks like a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 little handball that arise from 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.250
 big floating water bubbles where one 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.359
 can breathe and this sport allows the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.850
 population to forget the woes 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.440
 caused by that final fantasy says 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 it's the first game to spread the fans 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.730
 by cutting them out very small pieces 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.739
 already she totally abandons the style 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.610
 heroic fantasy to be in a universe 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:02.050
 much more futuristic of the more he 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.950
 uses a new combat system 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.760
 called ctv as to dwell on on the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.310
 leave she did it in the family ok 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.410
 the set is awarded to the player to choose 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.680
 an action without time pressure because it 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 pause or blow the fight 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
 is more strategic because we have more 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.959
 time to choose in its place a system 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040
 otan everywhere the player can control 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.900
 up to three characters but one 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 replacement system by the smell of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.620
 replace them with other characters 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.800
 in combat any time the limit break 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.860
 which are called overdrive 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.620
 mia I found for me that's 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.300
 not bad is done and it's also the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.980
 first game with good actors but 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:51.410
 a passage often been shunned by the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.410
 women in aa 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:12.900
 you and small novelty the music does not 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.970
 are not composed only by drew and webm 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.780
 axial otherwise let's talk a little bit about 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.150
 highlights of the game 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.690
 the cutscenes are just gorgeous 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.310
 brest possible the story is really 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.780
 exciting and moving and a 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 love story she even better in 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.280
 you will burn in hell 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.380
 this troupe is right the characters 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.450
 are super charismatic even at the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.639
 limit too attached besides small 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.960
 anecdote if we pay attention to the first name 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.330
 little god it's not my it's a 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.220
 only once by the game's characters there 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.690
 always pretends with checked threads 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.400
 among other things, it is because we can 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.889
 change the name at the beginning of the game it's not 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.229
 also can adapt to any case I 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.479
 I'm going to sleep less stupid tonight if 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.610
 only and mac game music 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.340
 are just perfect for draining them 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.260
 but at every moment of my life for 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.800
 points to do by cons I have not found 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.100
 big thing 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.139
 you are really very objective the game is 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.669
 maybe a little too ivy but hey 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.330
 when we see the sequel felt that this is 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.729
 not so serious 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.110
 well why I find too stylish 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.610
 in 2 brief conclusion made to sing 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.310
 it's a beautiful story that you 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.020
 will pass unforgettable game orders 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:26.910
 I hope it's because I have you 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.979
 made very big kisses if you have 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.720

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.730
 share and one but three gems 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.620
 and if you do not like you can 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.720
 put a bad position would not 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.720
 very nice for blizzard
