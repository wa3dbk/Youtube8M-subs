00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
about it just yet but I am sure that if

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
about it just yet but I am sure that if
you<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> end<00:00:39.300> result<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:40.079> no

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you look at the end result with no

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
you look at the end result with no
shading<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> no<00:00:40.980> color<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.059> will<00:00:42.300> probably

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
shading and no color you will probably

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
shading and no color you will probably
be<00:00:43.200> able<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> put<00:00:43.710> two<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.070> two<00:00:44.340> together<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
be able to put two and two together and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.930 
be able to put two and two together and
figure<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> am<00:00:46.230> working<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.820> but<00:00:47.820> as

so for this drawing I just chose a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.730 
so for this drawing I just chose a
handful<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> patterns<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.880> like

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
handful of patterns that I really like

some of them are in my upcoming book so
they<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.060> an<00:01:12.270> official<00:01:12.659> tangle<00:01:13.110> they're

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.270 
they are not an official tangle they're
just<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:14.189> patterns<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> created<00:01:15.479> myself

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
just some patterns that I created myself

it's<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.250> little<00:02:12.580> tripod<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.600> only

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it's just a little tripod so it only

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.830 
it's just a little tripod so it only
goes<00:02:13.870> like<00:02:14.020> six<00:02:14.560> inches<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.840> desk

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
goes like six inches off of the desk

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.700 
goes like six inches off of the desk
which<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.440> why<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:19.600> drawing<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.500> a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
which is why this this drawing is that a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.600 
which is why this this drawing is that a
little<00:02:21.520> bit<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.820> different<00:02:22.180> angle<00:02:22.470> then

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
little bit of a different angle then

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.660 
little bit of a different angle then
most<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.820> my<00:02:24.970> videos<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.920> posted<00:02:27.190> on

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
most of my videos that I have posted on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.160 
most of my videos that I have posted on
this<00:02:27.850> channel<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.850> because<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
this channel and that is because the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.890 
this channel and that is because the
screw<00:02:33.010> augment<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> little<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.090> longer<00:02:34.360> so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
screw augment is a little bit longer so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.280 
screw augment is a little bit longer so
I'm<00:02:35.230> able<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.650> actually<00:02:35.980> screw<00:02:36.640> my<00:02:37.290> camera

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
I'm able to actually screw my camera

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.090 
I'm able to actually screw my camera
onto<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.010> tripod<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.560> watch<00:02:41.770> my<00:02:41.950> last

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
onto the tripod the if you watch my last

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.760 
onto the tripod the if you watch my last
video<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.700> know<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.959> part<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.560> my

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
video you know that that part of my

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.960 
video you know that that part of my
camera<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.400> stripped<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:47.670> haven't<00:02:48.670> been

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
camera is stripped so I haven't been

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.460 
camera is stripped so I haven't been
that's<00:02:49.360> one<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> reasons<00:02:50.020> why<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.170> haven't

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that's one of the reasons why I haven't

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.000 
that's one of the reasons why I haven't
been<00:02:50.709> posting<00:02:50.770> many<00:02:51.459> videos<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.600> because<00:02:53.140> my

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
been posting many videos is because my

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.830 
been posting many videos is because my
camera<00:02:54.370> will<00:02:54.580> just<00:02:54.790> fall<00:02:55.060> off<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.330> those

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
camera will just fall off of those

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.680 
camera will just fall off of those
larger<00:02:56.320> tripods<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.030> screw<00:02:58.330> isn't

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
larger tripods because the screw isn't

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.350 
larger tripods because the screw isn't
long<00:02:58.840> enough<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.380> fit<00:02:59.770> into<00:02:59.950> my<00:03:00.220> camera<00:03:00.550> so

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
long enough to fit into my camera so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.000 
long enough to fit into my camera so
this<00:03:01.660> one's<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.020> little<00:03:02.140> bit<00:03:02.260> longer<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
this one's a little bit longer and it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.910 
this one's a little bit longer and it
fits<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.430> there<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.630> problem<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.740> that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
fits on there but the problem is is that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.710 
fits on there but the problem is is that
I<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.190> draw<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.550> kind<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.180> an<00:03:07.330> awkward

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
I have to draw a kind of an awkward

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.060 
I have to draw a kind of an awkward
angle<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.470> order<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:10.470> make<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> work<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.980> me

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
angle in order to make it work for me

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.380 
angle in order to make it work for me
because<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.520> so<00:03:12.700> short<00:03:13.080> anyways<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.790> is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
because it's so short anyways so that is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.949 
because it's so short anyways so that is
why<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.410> am<00:03:18.070> able<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.430> post<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.000> video<00:03:19.180> today<00:03:19.570> post

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
why I am able to post a video today post

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.620 
why I am able to post a video today post
my<00:03:20.080> camera<00:03:20.500> has<00:03:21.310> surprisingly<00:03:22.000> been

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
my camera has surprisingly been

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.600 
my camera has surprisingly been
cooperative

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
cooperative

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.550 
cooperative
cooperating<00:03:24.610> with<00:03:24.910> me<00:03:25.060> for<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.390> last<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.959> don't

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
cooperating with me for the last I don't

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.060 
cooperating with me for the last I don't
know<00:03:26.709> day<00:03:26.980> or<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:31.380> decided<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.769> kind

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
know day or so so I decided just to kind

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.330 
know day or so so I decided just to kind
of<00:03:33.100> take<00:03:33.370> advantage<00:03:33.519> of<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.950> record<00:03:35.950> as

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
of take advantage of that and record as

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.949 
of take advantage of that and record as
much<00:03:36.580> as<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.850> possibly<00:03:37.330> can

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
much as I possibly can

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.590 
much as I possibly can
at<00:03:38.470> least<00:03:38.680> for<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> next<00:03:39.130> couple<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:40.209> days<00:03:40.360> or

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
at least for the next couple of days or

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.820 
at least for the next couple of days or
so<00:03:41.670> until<00:03:42.670> my<00:03:43.209> camera<00:03:43.570> decides<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.200> die<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.620> me

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
so until my camera decides to die on me

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.340 
so until my camera decides to die on me
again<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:45.760> randomly<00:03:46.299> shuts<00:03:46.690> off<00:03:46.870> in

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
again it just randomly shuts off in

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
again it just randomly shuts off in
specific<00:03:48.340> places<00:03:49.260> my<00:03:50.260> art<00:03:50.530> not<00:03:50.769> specific

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
specific places my art not specific

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.460 
specific places my art not specific
places<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.150> shuts<00:03:52.750> off<00:03:52.900> whenever<00:03:53.320> it

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
places it just shuts off whenever it

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.370 
places it just shuts off whenever it
feels<00:03:53.680> like<00:03:54.209> luckily<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.420> only<00:03:55.630> ran<00:03:56.049> into<00:03:56.350> that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
feels like luckily I only ran into that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
feels like luckily I only ran into that
problem<00:03:56.760> once<00:03:57.760> while<00:03:58.269> recording<00:03:58.600> this<00:03:58.870> video

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
problem once while recording this video

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.900 
problem once while recording this video
but<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.549> didn't<00:04:00.850> affect<00:04:01.290> anything<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.650> far<00:04:03.640> as

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
but it didn't affect anything as far as

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.259 
but it didn't affect anything as far as
what<00:04:04.120> you're<00:04:04.269> seeing<00:04:04.540> because<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:06.670> wasn't<00:04:07.120> in

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
what you're seeing because it wasn't in

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.630 
what you're seeing because it wasn't in
a<00:04:07.450> spot<00:04:07.810> where<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.380> was<00:04:08.680> actually<00:04:08.860> putting<00:04:09.310> pen

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
a spot where I was actually putting pen

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.160 
a spot where I was actually putting pen
to<00:04:09.670> paper<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.180> was<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.630> think<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.900> was<00:04:11.019> adjusting

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
to paper I was I think I was adjusting

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.610 
to paper I was I think I was adjusting
something<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:13.360> just<00:04:13.750> randomly<00:04:14.290> turned

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
something and it just randomly turned

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.870 
something and it just randomly turned
off<00:04:14.739> on<00:04:14.950> me<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
off on me so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.380 
off on me so

otherwise I think I am gonna go with a
sony<00:04:33.630> handycam<00:04:34.290> I've<00:04:34.500> heard<00:04:34.650> some<00:04:34.830> really

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
sony handycam I've heard some really

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.840 
sony handycam I've heard some really
good<00:04:35.100> things<00:04:35.250> about<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.820> brand<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:37.850> they've

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
good things about the brand and they've

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.870 
good things about the brand and they've
been<00:04:39.060> around<00:04:39.270> for<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.810> while<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.380> handycam

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.130 

version<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.090> guess<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.390> could<00:04:45.540> say<00:04:45.570> has

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
version I guess you could say has

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.640 
version I guess you could say has
several<00:04:46.800> different<00:04:46.980> models<00:04:47.760> available<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.780> I

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
several different models available so I

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.950 
several different models available so I
think<00:04:50.100> that's<00:04:50.520> probably<00:04:51.090> what<00:04:51.510> I'm<00:04:51.600> going<00:04:51.870> to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
think that's probably what I'm going to

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.630 
think that's probably what I'm going to
go<00:04:52.110> with<00:04:52.260> but<00:04:52.500> we<00:04:52.830> shall<00:04:53.160> see<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.190> one

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
go with but we shall see so this is one

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.640 
go with but we shall see so this is one
of<00:04:56.760> my<00:04:56.850> favorite<00:04:57.210> patterns<00:04:57.630> it's<00:04:57.960> been<00:04:58.350> one<00:04:58.560> of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
of my favorite patterns it's been one of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.140 
of my favorite patterns it's been one of
my<00:04:58.710> favorite<00:04:59.100> patterns<00:04:59.280> for<00:04:59.670> a<00:04:59.700> really<00:05:00.000> long

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
my favorite patterns for a really long

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.480 
my favorite patterns for a really long
time<00:05:00.290> there's<00:05:01.290> so<00:05:01.470> many<00:05:01.590> variations<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.430> you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
time there's so many variations that you

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.240 
time there's so many variations that you
can<00:05:02.550> do<00:05:02.820> with<00:05:02.940> this<00:05:03.060> pattern<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.890> I'm<00:05:04.890> just

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
can do with this pattern and I'm just

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.610 
can do with this pattern and I'm just
really<00:05:06.210> liking<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:08.360> yeah<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:10.050> there's<00:05:10.440> not

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
really liking it yeah so there's not

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.410 
really liking it yeah so there's not
really<00:05:10.680> much<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.130> talk<00:05:11.460> about<00:05:11.520> because<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.210> did

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
really much to talk about because I did

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.240 
really much to talk about because I did
update<00:05:12.690> you<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.050> everything<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:13.920> my<00:05:14.040> last

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
video really this drawing is an 8 by 10

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.850 
video really this drawing is an 8 by 10
I<00:05:20.910> don't<00:05:21.270> know<00:05:21.420> if<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.600> said<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.500> was<00:05:22.560> done

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
I don't know if I said that it was done

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.440 
I don't know if I said that it was done
on<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:24.470> 8<00:05:25.470> by<00:05:25.680> 10<00:05:25.890> piece<00:05:26.190> of<00:05:26.400> 110<00:05:27.210> pound

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
on a 8 by 10 piece of 110 pound

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.420 
on a 8 by 10 piece of 110 pound
cardstock<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.770> usual<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:31.200> took<00:05:31.500> an<00:05:31.830> hour

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
cardstock as usual and it took an hour

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.090 
cardstock as usual and it took an hour
and<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.760> half<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.200> felt<00:05:34.410> like<00:05:34.590> it<00:05:34.740> took<00:05:34.770> a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
and a half but it felt like it took a

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.310 
and a half but it felt like it took a
lot<00:05:35.370> longer<00:05:35.430> than<00:05:35.970> that<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.780> felt<00:05:37.020> like<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:37.290> was

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
lot longer than that it felt like I was

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.280 
lot longer than that it felt like I was
sitting<00:05:37.770> at<00:05:37.980> my<00:05:38.100> desk<00:05:38.160> for<00:05:38.460> like<00:05:38.610> 3<00:05:38.850> or<00:05:38.940> 4<00:05:39.150> hours

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
sitting at my desk for like 3 or 4 hours

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.780 
sitting at my desk for like 3 or 4 hours
so<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:40.350> don't<00:05:40.560> know<00:05:40.710> why<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.420> maybe<00:05:42.900> I

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
so I don't know why that is maybe I

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.980 
so I don't know why that is maybe I
guess<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.940> did<00:05:45.090> get<00:05:45.270> up<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.540> couple<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:45.930> times

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
guess I did get up a couple of times

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.860 
guess I did get up a couple of times
while<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.440> was<00:05:46.560> drawing<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.600> went<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.660> got<00:05:48.720> a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
while I was drawing and went and got a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.350 
while I was drawing and went and got a
snack<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.500> sleep<00:05:50.280> with<00:05:50.430> my<00:05:50.550> dog<00:05:50.760> for<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.090> little

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
snack and sleep with my dog for a little

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.580 
snack and sleep with my dog for a little
bit<00:05:51.510> but<00:05:52.730> that's<00:05:53.730> the<00:05:53.880> thing<00:05:54.060> with<00:05:54.300> with<00:05:55.290> me

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
bit but that's the thing with with me

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.510 
bit but that's the thing with with me
drawing<00:05:56.070> these<00:05:56.730> types<00:05:57.030> of<00:05:57.830> artwork<00:05:58.830> is<00:05:59.070> that<00:05:59.100> I

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
drawing these types of artwork is that I

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.910 
drawing these types of artwork is that I
kind<00:05:59.910> of<00:05:59.970> take<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.180> lot<00:06:00.480> of<00:06:00.510> breaks<00:06:03.230> because<00:06:05.030> I

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
kind of take a lot of breaks because I

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.660 
kind of take a lot of breaks because I
don't<00:06:07.920> know<00:06:08.010> I<00:06:08.190> just<00:06:08.490> do<00:06:08.700> lately<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:09.720> have<00:06:10.140> been

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
don't know I just do lately I have been

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.100 
don't know I just do lately I have been
just<00:06:11.670> taking<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:12.060> lot<00:06:12.210> breaks<00:06:12.480> while<00:06:12.720> I've<00:06:12.840> been

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
just taking a lot breaks while I've been

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.320 
just taking a lot breaks while I've been
drawing<00:06:13.380> I'll<00:06:14.190> draw<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.490> like<00:06:14.700> half<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.120> piece

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
drawing I'll draw a like half the piece

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.540 
drawing I'll draw a like half the piece
and<00:06:15.600> then<00:06:15.720> I<00:06:16.020> don't<00:06:16.740> really<00:06:16.830> get<00:06:17.040> bored<00:06:17.400> with

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
and then I don't really get bored with

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.580 
and then I don't really get bored with
it<00:06:17.700> but<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.270> just<00:06:18.690> want<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:18.990> do<00:06:19.110> something<00:06:19.440> else

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
it but I just want to do something else

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.130 
it but I just want to do something else
for<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.830> little<00:06:20.040> bit<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:20.690> maybe<00:06:21.690> it's<00:06:21.870> because

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
for a little bit so maybe it's because

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.480 
for a little bit so maybe it's because
I've<00:06:22.320> been<00:06:22.350> doing<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.640> lot<00:06:23.970> of<00:06:24.030> these<00:06:24.390> lately<00:06:24.930> so

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
I've been doing a lot of these lately so

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.670 
I've been doing a lot of these lately so
it's<00:06:26.490> been<00:06:26.700> making<00:06:27.090> me<00:06:27.240> want<00:06:27.479> to<00:06:27.600> just<00:06:28.110> step

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
it's been making me want to just step

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.600 
it's been making me want to just step
away<00:06:28.800> from<00:06:28.950> it<00:06:29.220> for<00:06:29.400> a<00:06:29.430> little<00:06:29.580> bit<00:06:29.729> I

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
away from it for a little bit I

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.150 
away from it for a little bit I
again<00:06:31.300> this<00:06:32.200> all<00:06:32.500> has<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.860> do<00:06:32.980> with<00:06:33.070> the

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
again this all has to do with the

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.620 
again this all has to do with the
project<00:06:33.370> that<00:06:33.700> I'm<00:06:33.790> working<00:06:33.820> on<00:06:34.150> it's<00:06:34.450> been<00:06:34.600> a

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
project that I'm working on it's been a

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.500 
project that I'm working on it's been a
