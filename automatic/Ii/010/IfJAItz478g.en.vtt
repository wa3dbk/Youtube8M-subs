00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.570
 Big company 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.509
 other matter discussed by the speaker 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.310
 it was the theme i know alessandro plan 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.829

 this theme planning in a way 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.180
 in a way that is adequate for the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.069

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.329
 view your business in the short and 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.670

 prepared for the development of 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.829

 have your most prepared businesspeople going 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.040
 development of the economy of the 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.670
 municipality will grow and everyone will win 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.670
 thereby
