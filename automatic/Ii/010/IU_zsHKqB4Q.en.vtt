00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.220
 yuuwaa 77 today guys we get 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.160
 found for a brand new video 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.740
 so you're going to calm down express to the sounded 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.619
 hour badge on or solo rock jega 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.570
 so in about three minutes 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.730
 so I was equipped with the badges 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.230
 hours with the camouflage of Christmas of which 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.530
 that came out recently so I do not know 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.180
 exactly but I downloaded them ben 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.829
 not even a day after realizing this 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.680
 gameplay one or two days maximum 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.630
 of water guys during this low gameplay 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610
 we can say limits that 5th the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.340
 volunteer because ultimate ben jawad 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.000
 so there was a team in front of 2 4 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.680
 or 5 people 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 I do not know exactly in any case they 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.110
 were four at least bah saw I 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.490
 think when you camp at 5 the same 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.560
 place I think you have to you 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.509
 to know you will see for yourself 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.880
 respectful then there during this gameplay 20 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.290
 was not that much my goal saw that 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.790
 it was mostly to mount my opinion is not 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.259
 no kind of gold so that's why 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.329
 that you are going to have seen previously 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.659
 the more I was leaning 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.760
 severely left to miss as soon as he goes 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.540
 I leaned over for just the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.340
 assured to have the challenge so for 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.050
 have completed the challenge with camouflage 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 So do the 100 enemies in you 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.650
 leaning guys so the way the flavor 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.580
 rape it's going to be violent 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.750
 I could not find another word 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.190
 but in short we do not care guys so 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.600
 as I said that but in 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.760
 about three minutes I would have 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.909
 could do it in really much less 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.159
 of time so guys especially at a 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.049
 time for a severe delay of 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.159
 my part not in the house so seen 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.290
 that they had if I thought it 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.820
 was still going spawn underneath but he 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 is an ally who took his and in one 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.080
 time enemy balls take to and then 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.830
 I think I'll be there at that moment I 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.530
 would be out 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.690
 if the enemy also the ally excuse me 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.250
 would have managed to capture his low views 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.080
 that he was dead two days so I 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.000
 am I am going to wait for someone 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.429
 capture to be really sure lost 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 his affiliate is someone who has an enemy 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.610
 who will wait for me like that with a friend 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.970
 or something weird 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.939
 and then who will put it to me and then 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.990
 here are the guys so the second part 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.180
 of my series is going to be 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.500
 the second part of my sister's team 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.220
 will be carried out in the 12th of which I have 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.670
 had to do about 600 subtle rang 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.280
 replica badge 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.489
 5-6 that he stays years old I had to do them 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.330
 halak at 12 so simply bagelet 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.670
 to pick them up 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.540
 I saw that you were at we were in 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.200
 an aisle so it's especially ben 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.489
 we refuse to assault accurate etc etc 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.790
 Well, I favored the lake at 12 dutil and 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.080
 Well here it is accurate and the most 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 performing long distance everything 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.530
 just guys so there you see 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.790
 that frankly they wanted 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.220
 really my skin there were eyes 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.310
 everywhere there had been swinging flashes to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.160
 a moment I pick myself up and grenades 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.590
 so I'm having a lot of luck 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.660
 these are the guys so I'll think that's the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.810
 young age profile and I 'm having a good 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.480
 reflex in just my cartons 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.540
 so guys I want to trigger well 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.519
 matem not even 30 seconds a minute 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.830
 after getting it simply because 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.140
 you were going to have a diab and dogs 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.959
 there were griffins so go during 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.840
 7th frankly I had d who had 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.269
 certainly 6 summer 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.090
 not really very good in front but with 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.050
 me it was not better people me 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.569
 said I think I had to miss the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.890
 double still little by little says my fault 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.440
 for a moment I'm going to make them a 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.599
 series of fourteen 14 13 14 and I want 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.920
 to die foolishly 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.390
 then I chained a lot of series 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.540
 it is either a time dogs 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.830
 be places so it falls 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.830
 here are the guys so it's already good 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.709
 to have managed a wine express cam in 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.230
 conditions like these so the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.030
 dab down to jesper that the gameplay is going to you 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.860
 do so I hope the video you 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.799
 will be pleased to comment on 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.979
 liker it was mister thot on track at 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.979
