get<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> 12<00:02:24.890> or<00:02:25.190> 13<00:02:25.820> because<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.140> love<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
get a 12 or 13 because I just I love the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620 
get a 12 or 13 because I just I love the
front<00:02:27.680> end<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.190> now<00:02:28.850> plus<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.240> love<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
front end of it now plus I love the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.940 
front end of it now plus I love the
cross<00:02:29.810> plane<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.750> ended<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
cross plane so I ended up going to the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.700 
cross plane so I ended up going to the
store<00:02:34.330> figured<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.540> would<00:02:35.930> look<00:02:36.170> around<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
store figured I would look around and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.750 
store figured I would look around and
see<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.010> if<00:02:37.790> anything<00:02:38.590> caught<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:39.770> eye<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.490> you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
see if if anything caught my eye and you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.180 
see if if anything caught my eye and you
know<00:02:40.820> something<00:02:41.600> different<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.070> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
know something different and at this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.130 
know something different and at this
point<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.610> was<00:02:43.760> not<00:02:43.820> necessarily<00:02:44.540> dead<00:02:44.840> set<00:02:45.110> on

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140

r1 but it was one of my options I was

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.830

about Aprilia or Ducati Ducati and it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.450 
about Aprilia or Ducati Ducati and it
really<00:02:59.540> got<00:02:59.750> ruled<00:02:59.990> out<00:03:00.140> quickly<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
really got ruled out quickly for the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.030 
really got ruled out quickly for the
fact<00:03:01.700> that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.650 

there's<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.370> much<00:03:05.520> maintenance<00:03:05.940> involved<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
there's so much maintenance involved and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.550 
there's so much maintenance involved and
it's<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:06.960> expensive

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it's so expensive

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.160 
it's so expensive
it<00:03:08.070> was<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.760> my<00:03:08.970> budget<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.810> I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
it was just out of my budget so I

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.190 
it was just out of my budget so I
decided<00:03:10.800> against<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.070> walked<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.210> there

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
decided against that walked in there

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.900 
decided against that walked in there
were<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> couple<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.800> different<00:03:14.040> cvrs<00:03:14.580> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
were a couple of different cvrs that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.770 
were a couple of different cvrs that
really<00:03:15.570> look<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.140> me<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:18.150> sat<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.480> them

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
really look good to me and I sat on them

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.510 
really look good to me and I sat on them
and<00:03:18.960> they<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.080> something<00:03:19.740> was<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.280> off

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
and they just something was just off

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.760 
and they just something was just off
about<00:03:20.850> them<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.240> they<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.380> had<00:03:22.530> things

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
about them like they just had things

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.280 
about them like they just had things
that<00:03:22.950> were<00:03:23.040> wrong<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.490> him<00:03:23.640> or<00:03:23.820> they<00:03:23.940> were

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
that were wrong with him or they were

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
that were wrong with him or they were
too<00:03:25.290> high<00:03:25.530> mileage<00:03:25.800> or<00:03:26.430> whatever<00:03:26.970> kept

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
too high mileage or whatever kept

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.940 
too high mileage or whatever kept
looking<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.350> almost<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.860> know

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
looking and it almost like you know

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.810 
looking and it almost like you know
maybe<00:03:29.250> maybe<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> CBR<00:03:30.240> s<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:32.100> at<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.370> point<00:03:32.610> I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
maybe maybe the CBR s so at that point I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.030 
maybe maybe the CBR s so at that point I
really<00:03:33.390> started<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.840> look<00:03:33.990> at<00:03:34.110> CBR<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
really started to look at CBR is in a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880 
really started to look at CBR is in a
whole<00:03:35.220> different<00:03:35.580> light<00:03:35.790> and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.820 

it<00:03:39.310> became<00:03:39.700> one<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.780> biggest<00:03:41.020> options<00:03:41.680> or

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
it became one of the biggest options or

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.980 
it became one of the biggest options or
made<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.190> think<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.910> came<00:03:43.330> down<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.960> and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
made I think it came down to that and

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.370 
made I think it came down to that and
there<00:03:44.380> are<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.450> there<00:03:46.450> was<00:03:46.660> an<00:03:46.810> oh<00:03:47.020> nine

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
there are one but there was an oh nine

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.570 
there are one but there was an oh nine
or<00:03:47.770> 2010<00:03:48.730> or<00:03:48.940> one<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.470> was<00:03:50.560> yellow<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.280> I

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
or 2010 or one and it was yellow and I

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.030 
or 2010 or one and it was yellow and I
said<00:03:51.850> man<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.300> really<00:03:52.630> want<00:03:52.720> yellow<00:03:53.020> but<00:03:54.010> I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
said man I really want yellow but I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920 
said man I really want yellow but I
guess<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.280> could<00:03:54.340> paint<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.420> was<00:03:55.600> also<00:03:55.900> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
guess I could paint it and it was also a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.680 
guess I could paint it and it was also a
really<00:03:56.170> good<00:03:56.380> price<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:58.000> these<00:03:58.390> different
