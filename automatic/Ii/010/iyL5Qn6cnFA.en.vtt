00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.120 
look look at the defending its all for
poor<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> say<00:03:04.650> even<00:03:04.950> though<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
poor you have to say even though the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.470 
poor you have to say even though the
evidence<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.640> goals<00:03:05.820> if<00:03:06.000> she<00:03:06.150> will<00:03:06.359> see

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
evidence of the goals if she will see

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.229 
evidence of the goals if she will see
them<00:03:06.600> concede<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.440> slope<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.060> lap

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
them concede there and slope the lap

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.240 
them concede there and slope the lap
pace<00:03:09.510> maybe<00:03:10.230> they'll<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.859> look<00:03:11.100> at<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
pace maybe they'll have to look at the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.310 
pace maybe they'll have to look at the
system<00:03:11.519> maybe<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:12.690> he<00:03:12.810> doesn't<00:03:13.109> have<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
system maybe if he doesn't have the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.650 
system maybe if he doesn't have the
ability<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.769> bring<00:03:14.070> audit<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.630> capability<00:03:15.630> to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
ability to bring audit the capability to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.630 
ability to bring audit the capability to
bring<00:03:15.930> new<00:03:16.470> players<00:03:16.769> in<00:03:16.980> he<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.549> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
bring new players in he can have to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.400 
bring new players in he can have to
fiddle<00:03:18.209> around<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.810> plays<00:03:18.989> he's<00:03:19.200> got

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
fiddle around with the plays he's got

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.630 
fiddle around with the plays he's got
change<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.890> system<00:03:20.190> play<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.489> Lee

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
change the system play with Lee

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
change the system play with Lee
centre-backs<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.019> think<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.380> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
centre-backs and then we think that that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.520 
centre-backs and then we think that that
should<00:03:22.950> hopefully<00:03:23.850> damn<00:03:24.660> alleviate<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
should hopefully damn alleviate the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.870 
should hopefully damn alleviate the
problems<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.070> they've<00:03:26.310> got<00:03:26.489> at<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.700> back

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
problems that they've got at the back

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.599 
problems that they've got at the back
little<00:03:27.060> piece<00:03:27.390> but<00:03:27.950> going<00:03:28.950> forward<00:03:29.160> they<00:03:29.459> look

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
little piece but going forward they look

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.460 
little piece but going forward they look
very<00:03:29.640> very<00:03:29.910> impressive<00:03:30.420> yeah<00:03:30.870> good<00:03:31.230> start

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
