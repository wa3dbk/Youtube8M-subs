most<00:00:09.059> low<00:00:09.300> fat<00:00:09.540> diets<00:00:09.960> are<00:00:10.110> based<00:00:10.260> on<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> idea

most low fat diets are based on the idea

most low fat diets are based on the idea
that<00:00:10.920> saturated<00:00:11.550> fat<00:00:11.670> should<00:00:12.090> be<00:00:12.240> avoided

that saturated fat should be avoided

that saturated fat should be avoided
this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> 60s<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.730> 70s
