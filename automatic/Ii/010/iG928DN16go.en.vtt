hi<00:00:05.589> welcome<00:00:06.160> to<00:00:06.399> the<00:00:06.490> introduction<00:00:06.910> to<00:00:07.089> our

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:07.299 
hi welcome to the introduction to our

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.049 
hi welcome to the introduction to our
new<00:00:07.720> hard<00:00:08.049> surface<00:00:08.559> modeling<00:00:08.920> tutorial<00:00:09.490> now

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
new hard surface modeling tutorial now

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.000 
new hard surface modeling tutorial now
in<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:10.480> tutorial<00:00:10.629> we'll<00:00:11.139> be<00:00:11.170> constructing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
in this tutorial we'll be constructing

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.709 
in this tutorial we'll be constructing
the<00:00:12.190> piece<00:00:12.429> that<00:00:12.730> you<00:00:12.820> can<00:00:12.969> see<00:00:13.150> in<00:00:13.299> front<00:00:13.480> of

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
the piece that you can see in front of

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.510 
the piece that you can see in front of
you<00:00:13.840> which<00:00:14.350> fans<00:00:14.590> of<00:00:14.799> Doctor<00:00:15.129> Who<00:00:15.279> may

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
you which fans of Doctor Who may

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.390 
you which fans of Doctor Who may
recognize<00:00:16.059> as<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.420> Dalek<00:00:16.810> some<00:00:17.230> thought<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:18.039> I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
recognize as a Dalek some thought and I

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.580 
recognize as a Dalek some thought and I
picked<00:00:18.670> this<00:00:18.850> face<00:00:19.109> specifically<00:00:20.109> because<00:00:20.320> it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
picked this face specifically because it

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.710 
picked this face specifically because it
allows<00:00:20.920> me<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.340> demonstrate<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:22.030> variety<00:00:22.360> of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
allows me to demonstrate a variety of

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.930 
allows me to demonstrate a variety of
different<00:00:23.260> techniques<00:00:23.680> so<00:00:24.250> we've<00:00:24.430> got<00:00:24.670> some

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
different techniques so we've got some

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.330 
different techniques so we've got some
poly<00:00:25.180> modeling<00:00:25.600> in<00:00:25.750> here<00:00:26.110> we've<00:00:26.830> got<00:00:27.039> some

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
poly modeling in here we've got some

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.180 
poly modeling in here we've got some
curves<00:00:27.850> we've<00:00:28.510> got<00:00:28.720> some<00:00:29.050> extrusions<00:00:29.920> along

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
curves we've got some extrusions along

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.670 
curves we've got some extrusions along
curves<00:00:30.580> we've<00:00:31.060> got<00:00:31.240> some<00:00:31.480> motion<00:00:31.930> paths<00:00:32.259> we

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
curves we've got some motion paths we

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.560 
curves we've got some motion paths we
even<00:00:32.800> got<00:00:32.949> some<00:00:33.070> animation<00:00:33.670> snapshots<00:00:34.270> in

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
even got some animation snapshots in

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.139 
even got some animation snapshots in
here<00:00:34.750> so<00:00:35.320> it's<00:00:35.469> a<00:00:35.559> wide<00:00:35.800> variety<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.609> modeling

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
here so it's a wide variety of modeling

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.329 
here so it's a wide variety of modeling
techniques<00:00:37.629> that<00:00:37.960> we'll<00:00:38.109> be<00:00:38.260> using<00:00:38.409> it<00:00:39.129> also

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
techniques that we'll be using it also

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.910 
techniques that we'll be using it also
is<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:39.879> small<00:00:40.329> enough<00:00:40.569> component<00:00:41.229> we<00:00:41.440> keep<00:00:41.769> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
is a small enough component we keep the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.919 
is a small enough component we keep the
time<00:00:42.190> down<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.489> about<00:00:42.850> two<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.300> half<00:00:43.510> hours

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
time down to about two and a half hours

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.559 
time down to about two and a half hours
so<00:00:44.829> really<00:00:45.159> you<00:00:45.729> know<00:00:45.850> this<00:00:46.030> allowed<00:00:46.359> us<00:00:46.389> to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
so really you know this allowed us to

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:48.419 
so really you know this allowed us to
create<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.960> tutorial<00:00:47.229> that<00:00:48.010> would<00:00:48.159> demonstrate

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
create a tutorial that would demonstrate

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.180 
create a tutorial that would demonstrate
you<00:00:49.359> know<00:00:49.479> many<00:00:49.780> different<00:00:49.870> techniques<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:51.069> a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
you know many different techniques in a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.039 
you know many different techniques in a
short<00:00:51.460> space<00:00:51.819> of<00:00:51.879> time<00:00:52.120> which<00:00:52.690> will<00:00:52.899> then

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
short space of time which will then

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:54.899 
short space of time which will then
allow<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.589> extrapolate<00:00:54.129> upon<00:00:54.699> these

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
allow you to extrapolate upon these

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.239 
allow you to extrapolate upon these
techniques<00:00:55.389> and<00:00:55.839> construct<00:00:56.769> you<00:00:56.949> know<00:00:57.069> a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
techniques and construct you know a

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.129 
techniques and construct you know a
variety<00:00:57.579> of<00:00:57.909> different<00:00:58.179> hard<00:00:58.659> surface

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
variety of different hard surface

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.860 
variety of different hard surface
objects<00:00:59.559> what<00:01:00.370> I've<00:01:00.489> tried<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.969> do<00:01:01.149> is<00:01:01.479> go<00:01:01.839> over

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
objects what I've tried to do is go over

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.310 
objects what I've tried to do is go over
especially<00:01:02.769> some<00:01:03.639> ways<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.150> create<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:05.199> know

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
especially some ways to create you know

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.890 
especially some ways to create you know
very<00:01:05.650> rounded<00:01:06.310> geometry<00:01:06.940> like<00:01:07.119> this<00:01:07.390> with

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
very rounded geometry like this with

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.920 
very rounded geometry like this with
very<00:01:08.170> hard-edged<00:01:09.240> chamfers<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.600> so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
very hard-edged chamfers on it so

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.320 
very hard-edged chamfers on it so
opposed<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.800> smooth<00:01:12.430> geometry<00:01:12.700> which<00:01:13.180> you'd

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
opposed to a smooth geometry which you'd

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.030 
opposed to a smooth geometry which you'd
normally<00:01:13.540> see<00:01:13.780> used<00:01:14.230> on<00:01:14.380> something<00:01:14.740> like<00:01:14.860> this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
normally see used on something like this

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.570 
normally see used on something like this
which<00:01:15.730> has<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.940> much<00:01:16.500> curvier<00:01:17.500> edge<00:01:17.830> we've

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
which has a much curvier edge we've

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.060 
which has a much curvier edge we've
tried<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.850> keep<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.480> know<00:01:19.810> very<00:01:20.680> hard

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
tried to keep this you know very hard

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.520 
tried to keep this you know very hard
surface<00:01:21.610> even<00:01:21.880> components<00:01:22.510> like<00:01:22.660> this<00:01:22.900> have

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
surface even components like this have

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.710 
surface even components like this have
that<00:01:23.800> chamfered<00:01:24.790> edge<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.330> they're<00:01:25.540> not

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
that chamfered edge and they're not

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.450 
that chamfered edge and they're not
actually<00:01:26.290> smooth<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.980> can<00:01:27.040> see<00:01:27.340> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
actually smooth you can see the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.370 
actually smooth you can see the
difference<00:01:27.820> between<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.450> smooth<00:01:28.720> one<00:01:29.020> and

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
difference between the smooth one and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.920 
difference between the smooth one and
one<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.280> was<00:01:30.370> constructed<00:01:30.760> originally<00:01:31.720> as<00:01:31.900> a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
one that was constructed originally as a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.650 
one that was constructed originally as a
hard<00:01:32.290> surface<00:01:32.560> piece<00:01:33.100> we've<00:01:34.000> then<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.540> know

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
hard surface piece we've then you know

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.470 
hard surface piece we've then you know
done<00:01:34.930> some<00:01:35.340> wavier<00:01:36.340> components<00:01:37.090> like<00:01:37.240> these

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
done some wavier components like these

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.020 
done some wavier components like these
pipes<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:38.290> instance<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.950> won't<00:01:39.550> be<00:01:39.670> showing

pipes for instance I won't be showing
you<00:01:40.240> as<00:01:40.480> I<00:01:40.510> said<00:01:40.960> all<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.830> techniques<00:01:42.280> needed

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
you as I said all the techniques needed

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.940 
you as I said all the techniques needed
to<00:01:42.760> complete<00:01:43.300> this<00:01:43.480> project<00:01:44.020> in<00:01:44.260> fairly<00:01:44.680> short

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
to complete this project in fairly short

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.270 
to complete this project in fairly short
order<00:01:45.160> we'll<00:01:46.090> also<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.690> covering<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.590> last<00:01:47.860> part

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
order we'll also be covering a last part

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.310 
order we'll also be covering a last part
as<00:01:48.520> you've<00:01:48.640> probably<00:01:48.940> seen<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.750> renders<00:01:50.170> on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
as you've probably seen the renders on

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.040 
as you've probably seen the renders on
the<00:01:50.409> side<00:01:50.680> now<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.670> will<00:01:51.790> take<00:01:52.210> one<00:01:52.510> part<00:01:52.840> at

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the side now so I will take one part at

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.870 
the side now so I will take one part at
the<00:01:53.170> end<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.530> tutorial<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.400> show<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.610> how

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the end of this tutorial to show you how

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.670 
the end of this tutorial to show you how
to<00:01:54.940> do<00:01:55.180> these<00:01:55.330> renders<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.230> these<00:01:56.409> are

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
to do these renders and these are

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.670 
to do these renders and these are
contour<00:01:57.490> renders<00:01:57.940> with<00:01:58.120> mental<00:01:58.510> ray<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:59.409> this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
contour renders with mental ray so this

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.380 
contour renders with mental ray so this
is<00:01:59.830> kind<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.070> an<00:02:00.190> ambient<00:02:00.610> occlusion<00:02:00.820> with<00:02:01.360> a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
is kind of an ambient occlusion with a

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.950 
is kind of an ambient occlusion with a
mental<00:02:01.780> ray<00:02:01.930> contour<00:02:03.210> rendering<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.630> top<00:02:04.840> of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
mental ray contour rendering on top of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.380 
mental ray contour rendering on top of
it<00:02:05.110> now<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.100> all<00:02:06.250> done<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.550> one<00:02:06.580> pass<00:02:07.060> in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
it now this is all done in one pass in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.869 
it now this is all done in one pass in
Maya<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:07.990> pretty<00:02:08.530> easy<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:09.039> do<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.610> it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
Maya it's pretty easy to do and it

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.640 
Maya it's pretty easy to do and it
doesn't<00:02:10.060> actually<00:02:10.300> require<00:02:10.599> lighting<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
doesn't actually require lighting the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.920 
doesn't actually require lighting the
scene<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.609> think<00:02:12.999> it's<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:13.389> nice<00:02:13.599> way<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
scene now I think it's a nice way to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.530 
scene now I think it's a nice way to
show<00:02:14.139> off<00:02:14.379> your<00:02:14.829> final<00:02:15.280> model<00:02:15.609> and<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.420> be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
show off your final model and it can be

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.580 
show off your final model and it can be
done<00:02:16.749> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.109> in<00:02:17.260> fair

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
done you know in fair

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.559 
done you know in fair
short<00:02:18.010> order<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.730> we'll<00:02:18.849> be<00:02:19.030> covering<00:02:19.239> the

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
short order so we'll be covering the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.610 
short order so we'll be covering the
techniques<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.440> make<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.040> piece<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:23.230> also

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
techniques to make this piece and also

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.280 
techniques to make this piece and also
the<00:02:23.920> techniques<00:02:24.340> used<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.819> render<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the techniques used to render it so I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.979 
the techniques used to render it so I
hope<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.920> join<00:02:27.250> me<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:27.989> one
