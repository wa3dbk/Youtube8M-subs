this to get it to work okay so basically
a<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.289> ended<00:00:19.619> system<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.490> will<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
a one ended system what we will have is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.630 
a one ended system what we will have is
a<00:00:21.000> skybox<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.680> RF<00:00:22.920> output<00:00:23.430> and

with the sky I and this kit is designed

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.740 
with the sky I and this kit is designed
for<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> gap<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.490> between<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.150> basically

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
for the gap in between so basically

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
for the gap in between so basically
consists<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.349> 20<00:00:31.980> meters<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.489> rg6<00:00:33.149> and

okay<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.180> quickly<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> give<00:00:48.870> an

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
okay so quickly going to give an

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
okay so quickly going to give an
overview<00:00:49.200> how<00:00:49.620> we've<00:00:49.800> used<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.219> okay<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.120> if

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
overview how we've used this okay so if

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
overview how we've used this okay so if
we<00:00:51.420> look<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> Sky<00:00:52.649> box<00:00:52.860> here

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we look at the back of the Sky box here

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
we look at the back of the Sky box here
a<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.579> neat<00:00:53.789> feature<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.079> RF<00:00:55.500> 2

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
a very neat feature of it is that RF 2

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
a very neat feature of it is that RF 2
has<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> symbol<00:00:56.699> underneath<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.239> says<00:00:57.480> 9<00:00:58.020> volt

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
has a symbol underneath that says 9 volt

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.910 
has a symbol underneath that says 9 volt
okay<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.430> means<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.930> there's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> cyst<00:01:01.260> inside

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
okay it means that there's a cyst inside

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
okay it means that there's a cyst inside
of<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> modulator<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of this we have a modulator that can

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
of this we have a modulator that can
send<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> picture<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.739> feeding

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
send the picture that you're feeding

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
send the picture that you're feeding
your<00:01:05.400> television<00:01:06.030> via<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:07.080> HDMI<00:01:07.710> later

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
your television via your HDMI later

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
your television via your HDMI later
you're<00:01:08.159> scared<00:01:08.460> true<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.090> RF<00:01:09.360> cable<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you're scared true an RF cable and to a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
you're scared true an RF cable and to a
second<00:01:10.740> location<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.880> turn<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
second location so you can turn on and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.179 
second location so you can turn on and
so<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> modulation<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.770> allows<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so that the modulation or allows you to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
so that the modulation or allows you to
do<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.119> turn<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
do that and you can actually turn on the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
do that and you can actually turn on the
9<00:01:15.869> volt<00:01:16.170> feature<00:01:16.439> which<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.130> covered<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
9 volt feature which is covered in a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.690 
9 volt feature which is covered in a
separate<00:01:17.790> video<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> actually

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
separate video we do so it actually

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520 
separate video we do so it actually
sends<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> 9<00:01:21.270> volt<00:01:21.509> signal<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
sends in 9 volt signal out of and the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
sends in 9 volt signal out of and the
idea<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:22.979> 9<00:01:23.280> volt<00:01:23.549> signal<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
idea of this 9 volt signal is that it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
idea of this 9 volt signal is that it
allows<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> sky<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> far<00:01:26.189> end<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.820> pick

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
allows the sky on the far end the pick

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
allows the sky on the far end the pick
of<00:01:27.299> signals<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.920> remote<00:01:29.159> control<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of signals from a remote control and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
of signals from a remote control and
actually<00:01:30.329> change<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.020> channels<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.280> box

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
actually change the channels on this box

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
actually change the channels on this box
from<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> remote<00:01:33.570> location

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
from a remote location

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.100 
from a remote location
so<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.939> wire<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.450> ok<00:01:36.720> for

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so what so how do we wire with ok for

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
so what so how do we wire with ok for
the<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.409> time<00:01:37.650> 3<00:01:37.799> digits<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the first time 3 digits out here is this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.990 
the first time 3 digits out here is this
proxy<00:01:39.299> load<00:01:39.710> or<00:01:40.710> price<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.250> honor<00:01:41.460> which<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
proxy load or price your honor which you
can<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.479> push<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> RF<00:01:43.409> join

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
can actually just push on to the RF join

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.450 
can actually just push on to the RF join
an<00:01:45.170> RF<00:01:46.170> output<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> next<00:01:47.340> thing

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
an RF output here and the next thing

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
an RF output here and the next thing
here<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> coaxial<00:01:48.780> probe<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
here is this coaxial probe which you can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
here is this coaxial probe which you can
see<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.670> would<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
see here now what we would do is we

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
see here now what we would do is we
would<00:01:51.299> attach<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> end<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
would attach this at the end of the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
would attach this at the end of the
coaxial<00:01:54.060> cable<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.630> there's<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> separate

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
coaxial cable here there's a separate

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.679 
coaxial cable here there's a separate
video<00:01:55.530> covering<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
video covering how to do that

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.760 
video covering how to do that
but<00:01:56.929> it's<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.259> relatively<00:01:57.590> simple

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
but it's a relatively simple

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.559 
but it's a relatively simple
straightforward<00:01:58.100> process<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:59.390> need<00:01:59.539> a

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
straightforward process just need a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.139 
straightforward process just need a
static<00:02:00.200> pair<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.409> snips<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.069> it<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.969> what

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
static pair of snips to do it and what

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.300 
static pair of snips to do it and what
we<00:02:02.240> do<00:02:02.390> here<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.749> we<00:02:02.960> will<00:02:03.439> have<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.740> here<00:02:03.920> so

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
we do here is we will have it here so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.340 
we do here is we will have it here so
now<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.520> will<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.299> output<00:02:05.329> from<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.079> in

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
now we will have the output from this in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.119 
now we will have the output from this in
fab<00:02:06.649> true<00:02:07.189> this<00:02:07.399> jointer<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.530> connector<00:02:09.530> into

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
fab true this jointer and connector into

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.100 
fab true this jointer and connector into
this<00:02:10.250> coaxial<00:02:10.789> cable<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.660> calculator

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
this coaxial cable so the calculator

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.170 
this coaxial cable so the calculator
cable<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.620> its<00:02:12.739> simplest<00:02:13.129> form<00:02:13.250> would<00:02:13.849> simply

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
cable in its simplest form would simply

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.170 
cable in its simplest form would simply
run<00:02:14.390> from<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:15.099> directly<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.879> sky<00:02:17.150> I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
run from there directly to the sky I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.850 
run from there directly to the sky I
which<00:02:17.810> I'm<00:02:17.930> just<00:02:18.110> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.260> demonstrate<00:02:18.440> it

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
which I'm just going to demonstrate it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.220 
which I'm just going to demonstrate it
here<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.160> going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.430> pick<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
here we're going to pick it up and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.080 
here we're going to pick it up and
basically<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.410> import<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.340> side<00:02:22.549> so

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
basically the import is on this side so

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.380 
basically the import is on this side so
just<00:02:23.390> join<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:25.010> light<00:02:25.879> here<00:02:26.120> just

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
just join in and this light here just

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.089 
just join in and this light here just
indicates<00:02:26.840> are<00:02:27.019> we<00:02:27.110> picking<00:02:27.230> up<00:02:27.500> power<00:02:27.799> from

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
indicates are we picking up power from

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.589 
indicates are we picking up power from
the<00:02:28.190> Sky<00:02:28.370> box<00:02:28.549> which<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.970> course<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.299> should<00:02:29.360> be

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
the Sky box which of course we should be

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.839 
the Sky box which of course we should be
and<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.410> power<00:02:30.650> here<00:02:30.980> actually<00:02:31.340> fits

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
and then this power here actually fits

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.449 
and then this power here actually fits
directly<00:02:32.060> into<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.290> television<00:02:33.620> into<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.220> RF

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
directly into the television into the RF

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.600 
directly into the television into the RF
input<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.290> sensor<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:36.890> sits<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.489> top

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
input and this sensor here sits on top

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.280 
input and this sensor here sits on top
of<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> television<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.420> when<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.900> aim<00:02:39.079> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
of the television and when we aim the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.900 
of the television and when we aim the
remote<00:02:39.349> control<00:02:39.829> at<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.099> it'll<00:02:40.459> pass<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
remote control at this it'll pass the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.240 
remote control at this it'll pass the
signal<00:02:41.120> true<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.290> change<00:02:42.500> channels<00:02:43.099> on

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
signal true this to change channels on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.220 
signal true this to change channels on
the<00:02:43.400> Sky<00:02:43.579> box<00:02:43.790> in<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> other<00:02:44.150> location<00:02:44.780> okay

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the Sky box in the other location okay

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.410 
the Sky box in the other location okay
so<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:46.010> its<00:02:46.160> simplest<00:02:46.489> form<00:02:46.579> all<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.269> would

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
so in its simplest form all we would

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.910 
so in its simplest form all we would
have<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.780> cable<00:02:47.989> running<00:02:48.349> but<00:02:48.650> maybe<00:02:48.799> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
have is the cable running but maybe a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
have is the cable running but maybe a
few<00:02:48.950> tax<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.549> between<00:02:49.849> and<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.540> cola<00:02:50.810> or<00:02:51.079> an<00:02:51.530> F

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
few tax in between and a cola or an F

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.740 
few tax in between and a cola or an F
joiner<00:02:51.950> like<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.370> which<00:02:52.879> would<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.239> again

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
joiner like this which would be again

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.449 
joiner like this which would be again
attach<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.319> cable<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.769> it's<00:02:55.069> screwed<00:02:55.340> on

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
attach the cable and it's screwed on

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.710 
attach the cable and it's screwed on
like<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:55.910> gives<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.299> good<00:02:56.450> connection

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
like this and gives a good connection

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.470 
like this and gives a good connection
okay<00:02:57.379> now<00:02:57.890> we've<00:02:58.099> added<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.579> two<00:02:58.910> extra<00:02:59.299> F

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
okay now we've added in two extra F

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.539 
okay now we've added in two extra F
connectors<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.109> F<00:03:00.260> joiner<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:00.950> because

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
connectors and F joiner on this because

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.250 
connectors and F joiner on this because
in<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> lot<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:01.970> setups<00:03:02.510> what'll<00:03:02.870> happen<00:03:03.019> is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
in a lot of setups what'll happen is

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.170 
in a lot of setups what'll happen is
we'll<00:03:03.650> actually<00:03:03.799> be<00:03:03.980> joining<00:03:04.489> at<00:03:04.579> cables<00:03:05.060> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
we'll actually be joining at cables that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.120 
we'll actually be joining at cables that
already<00:03:05.540> exists<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.079> wall<00:03:06.349> okay

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
already exists in the wall okay

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.250 
already exists in the wall okay
and<00:03:07.760> maybe<00:03:07.940> joining<00:03:08.329> them<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.599> attic<00:03:08.870> so

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
and maybe joining them in the attic so

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.479 
and maybe joining them in the attic so
what<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:09.470> want<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:09.920> use<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.370> F

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
what we want to do is use the F

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.920 
what we want to do is use the F
connectors<00:03:10.910> because<00:03:11.090> they're<00:03:11.209> very<00:03:11.389> low<00:03:11.690> loss

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
connectors because they're very low loss

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.569 
connectors because they're very low loss
and<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.290> 11<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.680> sick<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.010> nine<00:03:13.160> volt<00:03:13.340> signal

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
and the 11 is sick the nine volt signal

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.460 
and the 11 is sick the nine volt signal
pass<00:03:13.940> through<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:14.780> we're<00:03:14.930> terminate<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
pass through so we're terminate the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.530 
pass through so we're terminate the
first<00:03:15.650> cable<00:03:15.889> this<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.250> f<00:03:16.489> joiner<00:03:16.819> RF

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
first cable this is f joiner RF

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.900 
first cable this is f joiner RF
connector<00:03:17.959> Yahiro<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.769> F<00:03:18.950> connector<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.579> we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
connector Yahiro this F connector and we

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.300 
connector Yahiro this F connector and we
join<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.389> two<00:03:20.540> cables<00:03:20.750> together<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:22.130> this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
join the two cables together like this

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.559 
join the two cables together like this
and<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.989> gives<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.230> good<00:03:24.410> low<00:03:24.829> low<00:03:25.819> signal<00:03:26.239> as<00:03:26.359> a

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
and it gives a good low low signal as a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.770 
and it gives a good low low signal as a
joint<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.639> that's<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.760> complete<00:03:29.090> overview<00:03:29.480> of

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
joint so that's a complete overview of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.930 
joint so that's a complete overview of
how<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:29.930> wireless<00:03:30.560> there's<00:03:31.069> two<00:03:31.310> possible

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
how we wireless there's two possible

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.490 
how we wireless there's two possible
complications<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:33.230> want<00:03:33.440> to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
complications to this and I want to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.900 
complications to this and I want to
quickly<00:03:33.680> cover<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.160> parent<00:03:34.489> for<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.669> kit

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
quickly cover this parent for this kit

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.360 
quickly cover this parent for this kit
okay<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.959> first<00:03:36.139> one<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.160> have<00:03:37.190> a

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
okay the first one is and we have a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.479 
okay the first one is and we have a
situation<00:03:37.669> such<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.569> with<00:03:38.900> new<00:03:39.109> sky<00:03:39.440> HD<00:03:40.099> boxes

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
situation such as with new sky HD boxes

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.729 
situation such as with new sky HD boxes
and<00:03:40.730> without<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.750> paralyzed<00:03:42.200> they<00:03:42.560> also

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
and without the paralyzed they also

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.339 
and without the paralyzed they also
don't<00:03:43.250> come<00:03:43.549> with<00:03:43.880> modulator<00:03:44.450> or<00:03:44.750> an<00:03:44.870> RF<00:03:45.139> out
