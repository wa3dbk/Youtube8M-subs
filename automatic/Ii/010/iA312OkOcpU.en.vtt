inspiration for deciding to go with that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
inspiration for deciding to go with that
saving<00:01:16.110> system<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.680> she<00:01:16.740> saves<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.030> you

saving system how she saves you so you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.370 
saving system how she saves you so you
don't<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> restart<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> whole<00:01:19.200> level

don't have to restart the whole level
well<00:01:19.799> sure<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> mean<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.790> most

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
well sure I mean I think the most

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
well sure I mean I think the most
obvious<00:01:21.299> inspiration<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.470> rewind<00:01:23.100> power

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
obvious inspiration was rewind power

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.719 
obvious inspiration was rewind power
from<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> sands<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> time<00:01:25.009> rewind<00:01:26.009> power<00:01:26.400> from

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
from the sands of time rewind power from

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.300 
from the sands of time rewind power from
the<00:01:26.850> sands<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> time<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> mechanism

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the sands of time that was a mechanism

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.240 
the sands of time that was a mechanism
which<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.540> unique<00:01:30.930> had<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> unique<00:01:31.950> visual

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
which was unique had a unique visual

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.859 
which was unique had a unique visual
identity<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.150> certainly<00:01:33.420> had<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> unique

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
identity it certainly had a unique

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
identity it certainly had a unique
gameplay<00:01:34.170> mechanic<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.670> knew<00:01:35.880> we

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
gameplay mechanic to it we knew we

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
gameplay mechanic to it we knew we
wanted<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.750> second<00:01:37.259> chance<00:01:37.290> mechanism<00:01:38.159> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
wanted a second chance mechanism like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
wanted a second chance mechanism like
that<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.030> encourage<00:01:39.390> exploration<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that to encourage exploration to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
that to encourage exploration to
encourage<00:01:41.280> risk-taking<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.150> encourage

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
encourage risk-taking to encourage

encourage risk-taking to encourage
people<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> try<00:01:43.170> different<00:01:43.409> things<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:44.009> combat

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
people to try different things in combat
