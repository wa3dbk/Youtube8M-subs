corners of a building and then once
those<00:00:58.199> four<00:00:58.440> corners<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.859> gone<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
those four corners are gone then you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
those four corners are gone then you
plant<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> roof<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> interior<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
going for it I was just doing this for

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
going for it I was just doing this for
some<00:01:37.560> fun<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.659> clip

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
some fun but I got a really good clip

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.090 
some fun but I got a really good clip
here<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> figured<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.920> help

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
here and I figured I could really help

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.530 
here and I figured I could really help
some<00:01:41.280> people<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.790> achievement<00:01:41.939> cuz

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
some people get this achievement cuz

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.700 
some people get this achievement cuz
it's<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> most<00:01:43.170> difficult<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it's probably the most difficult in the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's probably the most difficult in the
game<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> planted<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> four<00:01:46.020> sides

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
game now I planted it on the four sides

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.399 
game now I planted it on the four sides
the<00:01:46.619> roof<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.340> ended<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.640> getting<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.409> c4

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the roof and I ended up getting a c4

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
the roof and I ended up getting a c4
kill<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.159> destruction<00:01:50.670> kills<00:01:51.030> right

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
kill and then to destruction kills right

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330 
kill and then to destruction kills right
there<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.530> pretty<00:01:52.740> cool<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.070> wasn't

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there so that was pretty cool I wasn't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880 
there so that was pretty cool I wasn't
expecting<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.110> also<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> game<00:01:55.530> type<00:01:55.740> you're

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
expecting that also the game type you're

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.350 
expecting that also the game type you're
gonna<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> play<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.790> rush<00:01:57.060> for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
gonna want to play is gonna be rush for

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
gonna want to play is gonna be rush for
sure<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.469> defending<00:01:58.799> or

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
sure because then if you're defending or

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.100 
sure because then if you're defending or
attacking<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.540> go<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> main

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
attacking you can just go to the main

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
attacking you can just go to the main
points<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.829> B<00:02:02.040> plant<00:02:02.700> some<00:02:02.850> c4<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
points a and B plant some c4 on the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
points a and B plant some c4 on the
buildings<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> let's<00:02:04.140> say<00:02:04.320> you're<00:02:04.439> defending

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
buildings and let's say you're defending

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
buildings and let's say you're defending
when<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.850> building<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.570> got

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
when you see that building just got

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.589 
when you see that building just got
armed<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.710> base<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.489> got<00:02:08.640> armed<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
armed or that base just got armed you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.420 
armed or that base just got armed you
just<00:02:09.840> blow<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> c4<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> sides<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
just blow up the c4 on the sides and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.200 
just blow up the c4 on the sides and
you'll<00:02:11.520> get<00:02:11.670> whoever<00:02:11.849> armed<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.989> then

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
you'll get whoever armed it and then

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.490 
you'll get whoever armed it and then
maybe<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.450> few<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.780> his<00:02:13.870> friends<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.410> were

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
maybe a few of his friends that were

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.230 
maybe a few of his friends that were
just<00:02:14.680> tagging<00:02:15.010> along<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.150> you're

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
just tagging along and then if you're

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.030 
just tagging along and then if you're
attacking<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.110> rush<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
attacking you can just rush to the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.370 
attacking you can just rush to the
building<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:19.240> try<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.570> destroy<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.990> except

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
building to try and destroy it except

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.170 
building to try and destroy it except
just<00:02:20.770> try<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.100> bring<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> building<00:02:21.610> down<00:02:21.790> on

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
just try and bring the building down on

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.060 
just try and bring the building down on
it<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.260> get<00:02:23.380> anyone<00:02:23.620> defending

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
it so then you can get anyone defending

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.980 
it so then you can get anyone defending
it<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> mean<00:02:24.370> rush<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.060> probably<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> easiest

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
it I mean rush is probably the easiest

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.040 
it I mean rush is probably the easiest
way<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.410> do<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.680> achievement<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.400> my<00:02:27.490> opinion

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
way to do this achievement in my opinion

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.270 
way to do this achievement in my opinion
right<00:02:29.050> here<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> B<00:02:29.740> this<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.040> where<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.220> get

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
