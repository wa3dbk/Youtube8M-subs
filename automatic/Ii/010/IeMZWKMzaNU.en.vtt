cylinder in the head and I used the OEM
rocker<00:00:33.270> arms<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> pins<00:00:34.880> now<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
rocker arms and pins now what I did this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
rocker arms and pins now what I did this
morning<00:00:36.620> was<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.739> left<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> valve<00:00:38.340> cover<00:00:38.670> off

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
morning was I left the valve cover off

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.840 
morning was I left the valve cover off
and<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.870> cranked<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> minute<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.550> all

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and I cranked it about a minute not all

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600 
and I cranked it about a minute not all
at<00:00:42.000> once<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.360> intermittently<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.430> did

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
at once just intermittently and we did

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209 
at once just intermittently and we did
that<00:00:44.789> until<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.450> oil<00:00:45.870> came<00:00:46.350> dripping<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that until some oil came dripping out of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
that until some oil came dripping out of
the<00:00:47.370> head<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> shows<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.270> got<00:00:48.320> oil

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the head and that shows we got oil

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 
the head and that shows we got oil
through<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> system<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.700> oil<00:00:50.910> pumps<00:00:51.239> working

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
through the system the oil pumps working

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
through the system the oil pumps working
and<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.680> coming<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> head<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.730> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and if it's coming out the head then we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
and if it's coming out the head then we
know<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.270> also<00:00:54.480> delivering<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> crank

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
know it's also delivering to the crank

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
know it's also delivering to the crank
and<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.410> connecting<00:00:58.410> rod<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.109> some

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and the connecting rod so we got some

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
and the connecting rod so we got some
oil<00:01:01.500> through<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> system<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.579> that's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
oil through the system we know that's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140 
oil through the system we know that's
working<00:01:03.830> also<00:01:04.830> rather<00:01:05.100> than<00:01:05.400> hook<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
working also rather than hook up the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.149 
working also rather than hook up the
solenoid<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> battery<00:01:07.290> itself<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> hooked

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
solenoid to the battery itself I hooked

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.630 
solenoid to the battery itself I hooked
up<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.000> six<00:01:09.330> volt<00:01:09.570> batteries<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.770> series<00:01:11.430> which

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
up to six volt batteries in series which

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
up to six volt batteries in series which
gives<00:01:11.850> us<00:01:12.000> 12<00:01:12.210> volts<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.189> that<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
gives us 12 volts and that way I can

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
gives us 12 volts and that way I can
just<00:01:14.700> swap<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> battery<00:01:16.159> anytime<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> want

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
just swap out the battery anytime I want

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
just swap out the battery anytime I want
to<00:01:17.549> leave<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.000> solenoid<00:01:18.840> activator<00:01:19.619> hooked

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to leave this solenoid activator hooked

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.170 
to leave this solenoid activator hooked
up<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:22.080> hook<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.189> small<00:01:23.580> wire<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
up we hook that up to the small wire on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210 
up we hook that up to the small wire on
the<00:01:24.330> solenoid<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.869> gives<00:01:25.290> us<00:01:25.439> 12<00:01:25.710> volts<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the solenoid that gives us 12 volts and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
the solenoid that gives us 12 volts and
then<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.509> hit<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:29.150> starter<00:01:30.150> button<00:01:30.360> here

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
then when we hit the starter button here

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.560 
then when we hit the starter button here
you'll<00:01:31.350> hear<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> solenoid<00:01:32.610> engage<00:01:33.299> you'll

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you'll hear the solenoid engage you'll

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
you'll hear the solenoid engage you'll
hear<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:33.930> click<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> way<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.420> can

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
hear a little click so that way we can

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.249 
hear a little click so that way we can
just<00:01:39.750> leave<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.850> 12<00:01:41.850> volt<00:01:42.119> power<00:01:42.390> hooked<00:01:43.020> up

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
just leave this 12 volt power hooked up

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.100 
just leave this 12 volt power hooked up
with<00:01:43.409> solenoid<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.509> swap<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> battery

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with solenoid and swap out the battery

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.319 
with solenoid and swap out the battery
whichever<00:01:46.890> battery<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.369> got<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.880> hottest

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
whichever battery I got that's hottest

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.020 
whichever battery I got that's hottest
this<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.560> little<00:01:49.619> bit<00:01:49.950> low<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> did

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
this one might be a little bit low I did

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
this one might be a little bit low I did
quite<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> bit<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> cranking<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.829> engine

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
quite a bit of cranking on the engine

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
quite a bit of cranking on the engine
this<00:01:53.280> morning<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> make<00:01:54.060> sure<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.479> had<00:01:54.689> oil

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this morning to make sure we had oil

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
this morning to make sure we had oil
coming<00:01:55.320> through<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.119> I'm<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> hook<00:01:57.570> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
coming through so I'm going to hook this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.969 
coming through so I'm going to hook this
red<00:01:58.770> cable<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.430> here<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.740> we're<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
red cable up here and we're going to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.590 
red cable up here and we're going to
turn<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.340> motor<00:02:02.640> over<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.479> can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
turn this motor over and see if we can

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.130 
turn this motor over and see if we can
get<00:02:03.719> anything

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
get anything

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.080 
get anything
it's<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> same<00:02:07.560> carb<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> exhaust<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it's the same carb and exhaust that I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's the same carb and exhaust that I
had<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> engine<00:02:11.039> before<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.550> swapped<00:02:11.880> out

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
had on the engine before I swapped out

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.930 
had on the engine before I swapped out
the<00:02:12.120> cylinder<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.840> head<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.610> should

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the cylinder and head so it it should

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.660 
the cylinder and head so it it should
work<00:02:15.319> also<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.590> left<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> carburetor<00:02:17.400> hooked

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
work also I left the carburetor hooked

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
work also I left the carburetor hooked
up<00:02:17.819> when<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.150> cranking<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> oil

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
up when I was cranking it to get the oil

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.839 
up when I was cranking it to get the oil
through<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.800> we<00:02:22.800> should<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.280> enough<00:02:23.580> gas

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
through it so we should have enough gas

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.120 
through it so we should have enough gas
through<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> system<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:25.980> any

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
through the system I don't see any

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.360 
through the system I don't see any
reason<00:02:26.459> why<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.640> shouldn't<00:02:27.120> crank<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.720> up

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
reason why it shouldn't crank right up

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.949 
reason why it shouldn't crank right up
now<00:02:30.410> one<00:02:31.410> thing<00:02:31.650> you've<00:02:31.830> got<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.959> make

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
now one thing you've got to do is make

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.559 
now one thing you've got to do is make
sure<00:02:33.989> your<00:02:34.560> valves<00:02:34.980> are<00:02:35.099> set<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.640> before

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
sure your valves are set right before

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.890 
sure your valves are set right before
you<00:02:36.690> crank<00:02:36.989> something<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
you crank something like this up the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.059 
you crank something like this up the
reason<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:42.440> you've<00:02:43.440> got<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> valve

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
reason for that is if you've got a valve

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.830 
reason for that is if you've got a valve
that's<00:02:44.310> too<00:02:44.519> tight<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> hang

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that's too tight it's going to hang

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.770 
that's too tight it's going to hang
either<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.010> intake<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.850> exhaust<00:02:48.269> open

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
either the intake or the exhaust open

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.150 
either the intake or the exhaust open
and<00:02:48.959> you're<00:02:49.380> not<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.799> get<00:02:49.950> any

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and you're not going to get any

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.940 
and you're not going to get any
compression<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.120> after<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> installed<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
compression so after I installed the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430 
compression so after I installed the
rocker<00:02:53.280> arms<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.940> crank<00:02:54.569> down<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.049> cam

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
rocker arms and crank down the cam

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.039 
rocker arms and crank down the cam
retaining<00:02:55.950> bracket<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:57.390> made<00:02:57.599> sure<00:02:57.630> we

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
retaining bracket I just made sure we

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.520 
retaining bracket I just made sure we
had<00:02:58.519> 0.004<00:02:59.549> on<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.569> intake<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.170> pointing

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
had 0.004 on the intake and pointing

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.759 
had 0.004 on the intake and pointing
level<00:03:01.769> five<00:03:02.069> on<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.730> exhaust<00:03:03.349> so<00:03:04.349> we<00:03:04.560> should

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
level five on the exhaust so we should

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.770 
level five on the exhaust so we should
have<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.099> good<00:03:05.489> seal<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> valves<00:03:06.599> you'll

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
have a good seal on the valves you'll

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.050 
have a good seal on the valves you'll
want<00:03:07.019> them<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.650> too<00:03:07.830> loose<00:03:08.099> rather<00:03:08.820> than

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
want them a little too loose rather than

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.400 
want them a little too loose rather than
too<00:03:09.239> tight<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.780> too<00:03:09.959> tight<00:03:10.200> they're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
too tight if it's too tight they're

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.900 
too tight if it's too tight they're
going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> hang<00:03:10.769> open<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.400> won't<00:03:11.489> get<00:03:11.730> any

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
going to hang open you won't get any

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.470 
going to hang open you won't get any
compression<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:15.320> this<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:17.480> same

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
a little switch here I've got so rather

a little switch here I've got so rather
than<00:03:31.829> use<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.100> kill<00:03:32.519> wire<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.940> use<00:03:33.239> this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
than use the kill wire I use this

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.349 
than use the kill wire I use this
trigger<00:03:34.230> wire<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> kill<00:03:35.700> once<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.120> turn

trigger wire for the kill once I turn
that<00:03:36.569> off<00:03:36.630> it'll<00:03:37.440> stop<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.829> trigger<00:03:38.220> impulse

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that off it'll stop the trigger impulse

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.849 
that off it'll stop the trigger impulse
and<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.329> coil<00:03:39.600> won't<00:03:40.200> send<00:03:40.500> an<00:03:40.620> impulsive

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
and the coil won't send an impulsive

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.289 
and the coil won't send an impulsive
coil<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:42.440> it'll<00:03:43.440> shut<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.799> off<00:03:44.090> right<00:03:45.090> now

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

it's<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:45.989> once<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.560> hit<00:03:46.739> this<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.220> hopefully

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's on so once I hit this it hopefully

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.210 
it's on so once I hit this it hopefully
it'll<00:03:48.180> start<00:03:50.480> then<00:03:51.480> we've<00:03:51.660> got<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.220> coil

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it'll start then we've got the coil

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.370 
it'll start then we've got the coil
