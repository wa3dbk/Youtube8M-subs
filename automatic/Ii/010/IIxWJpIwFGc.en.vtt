00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
looks a bit bigger than normal is they

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.319 
looks a bit bigger than normal is they
just<00:04:07.379> me<00:04:07.560> he<00:04:08.340> might<00:04:08.489> be<00:04:08.579> an<00:04:08.639> enormous<00:04:08.819> fun<00:04:09.150> that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
just me he might be an enormous fun that

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.180 
just me he might be an enormous fun that
could<00:04:09.480> well<00:04:09.690> be<00:04:09.870> enormous<00:04:10.379> fun<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:11.040> let's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
could well be enormous fun but let's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.809 
could well be enormous fun but let's
test<00:04:11.519> out<00:04:11.699> if<00:04:11.849> we<00:04:11.970> give<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.299> fly<00:04:12.599> hm<00:04:13.699> does<00:04:14.699> that

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
test out if we give the fly hm does that

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.279 
test out if we give the fly hm does that
let<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.120> fly<00:04:15.359> do<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:15.569> have<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.989> have<00:04:16.139> that

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
let them fly do you have to have that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.199 
let them fly do you have to have that
now<00:04:16.440> maybe<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> default<00:04:17.760> sitting

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
now maybe it's like the default sitting

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.339 
now maybe it's like the default sitting
in<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.449> config<00:04:20.599> knowing<00:04:21.599> we<00:04:21.690> can't<00:04:21.900> even<00:04:22.079> fly

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
in the config knowing we can't even fly

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.640 
in the config knowing we can't even fly
now

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650
