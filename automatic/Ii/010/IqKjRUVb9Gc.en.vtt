it's<00:03:29.459> been<00:03:29.489> done<00:03:29.790> though<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.150> very<00:03:30.390> like<00:03:30.540> say

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
it's been done though it's very like say

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.320 
it's been done though it's very like say
me<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:32.190> taken<00:03:32.610> me<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:32.730> long<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.209> put
