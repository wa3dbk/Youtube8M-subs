 Young people, this is Mike Oher, 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.160
 a new student, so I'm waiting for you to give him a warm welcome. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.640
 Mike, you can go sit down. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.080
 It's a quizz based on information 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.760
 you learned last year in your science class. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.720
 Do not worry, it will not be noted. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.640
 I just want to see on how much information to come back. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.080
 Just answer where you know. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800
 Thank you. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.920
 - Can I go? - Yes. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.120
 Take your book.
