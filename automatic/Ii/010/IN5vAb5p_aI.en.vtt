gets to make that choice kind of
specialized<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.620> two<00:03:16.709> different<00:03:16.860> ways<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
specialized in two different ways so and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.360 
specialized in two different ways so and
how<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.720> they<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.350> missions<00:03:19.680> kind<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.040> apply
