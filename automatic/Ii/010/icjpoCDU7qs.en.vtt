just my frame but up down left and right
so<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> spdr<00:00:26.340> convention<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.180> learned<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so here the spdr convention we learned a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
so here the spdr convention we learned a
lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> things<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> number<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
lot of things and number one is that the
