00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.120 
what I'd have to cut out so as you can
see<00:01:46.890> after<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.930> just<00:01:48.930> looked<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> clip

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
see after I've just looked at the clip
and<00:01:50.369> put<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.820> against<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> toy<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.780> took<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and put it up against the toy I took the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
and put it up against the toy I took the
toy<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:55.229> basically<00:01:55.470> cut<00:01:55.979> everything<00:01:56.630> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
toy and I basically cut everything that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
toy and I basically cut everything that
was<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> cut

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
was in the way and you don't want to cut

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
was in the way and you don't want to cut
it<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.729> completely<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.840> wanna<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it down completely because you wanna you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
it down completely because you wanna you
want<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> thing<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> kind<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> clip

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
want the thing to kind of so the clip

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.940 
want the thing to kind of so the clip
doesn't<00:02:05.369> sink<00:02:05.729> too<00:02:05.939> far<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.380> just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
doesn't sink too far in right so just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
doesn't sink too far in right so just
shave<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.119> parts

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
shave it down a little bit the parts

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.770 
shave it down a little bit the parts
that<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.720> stuck<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.790> make<00:02:11.790> sure<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.660> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
that get stuck and make sure as you can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.820 
that get stuck and make sure as you can
see<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> cut

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
see I cut

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
see I cut
peace-out<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> clip<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.060> doesn't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
peace-out of the clip so that doesn't

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.750 
peace-out of the clip so that doesn't
interfere<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> next<00:02:18.600> step<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:18.900> be

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
interfere and the next step would be

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.110 
interfere and the next step would be
making<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.620> rails<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> clip

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
making the rails so that the clip

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.600 
making the rails so that the clip
doesn't<00:02:24.390> get<00:02:24.630> stuck<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.040> slides<00:02:26.370> out

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
doesn't get stuck so it slides out

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.320 
doesn't get stuck so it slides out
properly<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.230> do<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.940> take<00:02:30.180> your

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
properly so what you do is you take your

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.690 
properly so what you do is you take your
DVD<00:02:30.540> case<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.790> pretty<00:02:35.790> easy<00:02:36.560> just

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
DVD case and this is pretty easy just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
DVD case and this is pretty easy just
you<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.850> cut<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.180> DVD<00:02:39.510> case<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.430> here's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
you just cut your DVD case and here's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.860 
you just cut your DVD case and here's
where<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.910> your<00:02:41.940> four<00:02:42.270> rails

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
where you get your four rails

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.080 
where you get your four rails
make<00:02:43.080> sure<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.350> cut<00:02:43.560> four<00:02:43.890> railings<00:02:44.400> from

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
make sure you cut four railings from

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.820 
make sure you cut four railings from
your<00:02:45.210> DVD<00:02:45.360> case<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.170> basically<00:02:46.350> what<00:02:46.710> we're

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
your DVD case and basically what we're

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.040 
your DVD case and basically what we're
looking<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:48.450> L<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.740> corner<00:02:50.160> because

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
looking for is that L the corner because

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.120 
looking for is that L the corner because
it<00:02:52.050> would<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.320> make<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.560> easier<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.980> glue

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it would just make it easier to glue

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.000 
it would just make it easier to glue
down<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> gum<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.590> when<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.709> glue<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
down on the gum and when you glue it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.530 
down on the gum and when you glue it
you're<00:02:56.850> gonna<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> put<00:02:57.330> something

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you're gonna have to put something

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.570 
you're gonna have to put something
underneath<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.490> so<00:02:59.490> what<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> did<00:03:00.390> was<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:02.310> same

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
underneath it so what I did was the same

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.690 
underneath it so what I did was the same
thing<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.970> made<00:03:03.150> from<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> clip<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:05.070> got

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
thing I made from for the clip I got

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.150 
thing I made from for the clip I got
those<00:03:05.850> same<00:03:06.180> pieces<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.690> plastic<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.380> put<00:03:08.070> them

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
those same pieces of plastic I put them

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
those same pieces of plastic I put them
underneath<00:03:09.620> then<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> did<00:03:11.160> was<00:03:11.400> put<00:03:12.230> my

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
underneath then what I did was put my

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.500 
underneath then what I did was put my
little<00:03:13.620> railing<00:03:13.860> down<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.670> glued<00:03:15.300> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
little railing down and glued the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.320 
little railing down and glued the
railing<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.640> glued<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> railings<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
railing I glued the railings of the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.150 
railing I glued the railings of the
piece<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.870> then<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.260> railing<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.830> side

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
piece and then the railing to the side

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.229 
piece and then the railing to the side
so<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.239> doesn't<00:03:21.540> move<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.090> this

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
so that it doesn't move and you do this

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.540 
so that it doesn't move and you do this
to<00:03:24.360> both<00:03:24.510> sides<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:26.900> before<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.200> that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
to both sides but before you do that

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.210 
to both sides but before you do that
what<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.580> did<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:31.590> probably<00:03:31.980> isn't<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
what I did was this probably isn't the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.590 
what I did was this probably isn't the
best<00:03:32.280> way<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.420> way<00:03:33.570> I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
best way to do it but this is the way I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.350 
best way to do it but this is the way I
did<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.110> put<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> little<00:03:35.160> as<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:36.330> a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
did it I put a little as you can see a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.790 
did it I put a little as you can see a
little<00:03:38.420> you'd<00:03:39.420> call<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.810> switch<00:03:40.140> kind<00:03:40.709> of

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
little you'd call it a switch kind of

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.920 
little you'd call it a switch kind of
thing<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.220> what<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.030> switch<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.480> gonna<00:03:42.720> do

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
thing and what this switch is gonna do

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.220 
thing and what this switch is gonna do
later<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> video<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.690> make<00:03:45.690> sure<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.019> clip

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
later in the video is make sure the clip

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.949 
later in the video is make sure the clip
doesn't<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.709> randomly<00:03:47.160> fall<00:03:47.489> out<00:03:47.959> it's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
doesn't just randomly fall out it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.229 
doesn't just randomly fall out it's
pretty<00:03:49.230> primitive<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.519> anything

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
pretty primitive it's not anything

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.420 
pretty primitive it's not anything
special<00:03:51.570> it's<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.500> clip<00:03:53.100> with<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
special it's just a clip with the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.130 
special it's just a clip with the
straight<00:03:53.820> piece<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.030> plastic<00:03:54.510> going<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.110> a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
straight piece of plastic going out to a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.610 
straight piece of plastic going out to a
certain<00:03:55.590> point<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.070> later<00:03:57.230> you're<00:03:58.230> gonna<00:03:58.320> put

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
certain point and later you're gonna put

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.800 
certain point and later you're gonna put
a<00:03:58.890> piece<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.459> another<00:03:59.940> plastic<00:04:00.209> sticking<00:04:00.720> out

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
a piece of another plastic sticking out

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.410 
a piece of another plastic sticking out
of<00:04:00.930> your<00:04:00.959> clip<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.590> basically<00:04:02.310> what<00:04:03.090> happens

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
of your clip so basically what happens

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.210 
of your clip so basically what happens
is<00:04:04.100> both<00:04:05.100> these<00:04:05.340> things<00:04:07.070> basically<00:04:08.070> you're

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
is both these things basically you're

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000 
is both these things basically you're
going<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.530> clips<00:04:10.830> not

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
going to do this so that the clips not

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.380 
going to do this so that the clips not
going<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.220> come<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.700> when<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.000> slide<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
going to come out and when you slide the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.810 
going to come out and when you slide the
thing<00:04:13.170> over<00:04:13.350> then<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.190> can<00:04:14.220> pull<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.640> clip

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
thing over then you can pull the clip

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.630 
thing over then you can pull the clip
out<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:16.080> yeah<00:04:16.350> again<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.950> very<00:04:17.370> primitive

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
out so yeah again it's very primitive

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.229 
out so yeah again it's very primitive
but<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.660> does<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.019> job<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:20.580> there<00:04:20.790> there's<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
but it does the job so there there's a

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.350 
but it does the job so there there's a
switch<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.260> here<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.530> go<00:04:22.729> I'm<00:04:23.729> just<00:04:23.789> gonna<00:04:24.150> glue

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
switch so here we go I'm just gonna glue

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.820 
switch so here we go I'm just gonna glue
all<00:04:25.320> these<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.830> now

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
all these down now

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.909 
all these down now
okay<00:04:28.860> after<00:04:29.340> you're<00:04:29.460> done<00:04:30.500> basically<00:04:31.500> gluing

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
okay after you're done basically gluing

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.320 
okay after you're done basically gluing
your<00:04:31.949> railing<00:04:32.400> what<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.580> said<00:04:32.850> before<00:04:33.000> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
your railing what I said before is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.770 
your railing what I said before is
you're<00:04:34.139> gonna<00:04:34.350> need<00:04:34.560> four<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.479> actually<00:04:36.479> two

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
you're gonna need four but actually two

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.110 
you're gonna need four but actually two
worked<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.259> for<00:04:37.410> me<00:04:37.440> pretty<00:04:37.740> well<00:04:37.949> so<00:04:38.520> what<00:04:39.090> I

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
worked out for me pretty well so what I

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.060 
worked out for me pretty well so what I
did<00:04:39.389> was<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.840> took<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:41.270> looks<00:04:42.270> about<00:04:42.389> like

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
did was I took this looks about like

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.790 
did was I took this looks about like
three<00:04:44.070> millimeter<00:04:44.580> thick<00:04:44.970> plastic<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:46.050> I

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
three millimeter thick plastic and I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.129 
three millimeter thick plastic and I
glued<00:04:47.130> one<00:04:47.430> patch<00:04:47.729> here<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.900> railing

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
glued one patch here and the railing

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.909 
glued one patch here and the railing
right<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.449> what<00:04:51.449> happens<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.990> basically

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
right here and what happens is basically

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.640 
right here and what happens is basically
just<00:04:53.750> slides<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:54.960> on<00:04:55.080> top<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.440> railing

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
just slides in on top of that railing

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.710 
just slides in on top of that railing
and<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:57.979> pretty<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.970> know<00:05:00.090> not<00:05:00.300> too<00:05:00.479> bad<00:05:00.690> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
and it pretty you know not too bad I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.409 
and it pretty you know not too bad I
mean<00:05:00.870> you're<00:05:01.470> gonna<00:05:01.590> be<00:05:01.770> using<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.220> for<00:05:02.419> video

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
mean you're gonna be using it for video

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.600 
mean you're gonna be using it for video
stuff<00:05:04.110> anyway<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:05.130> as<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:06.180> can<00:05:06.270> see<00:05:06.330> here<00:05:07.610> it's

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
stuff anyway so as you can see here it's

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.279 
stuff anyway so as you can see here it's
the<00:05:08.729> same<00:05:08.940> thing<00:05:09.000> basically<00:05:09.780> except<00:05:10.110> it's<00:05:10.229> a

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
the same thing basically except it's a

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.960 
the same thing basically except it's a
little<00:05:10.500> bit<00:05:10.590> cut<00:05:10.889> out<00:05:11.039> because<00:05:11.610> of<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.820> way<00:05:11.940> I

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
little bit cut out because of the way I

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.560 
little bit cut out because of the way I
did<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:13.080> clip<00:05:13.729> what<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.760> did<00:05:15.000> was<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.210> took<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
did the clip what I did was I took a

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.960 
did the clip what I did was I took a
piece<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.050> DVD<00:05:16.440> case<00:05:16.680> stuck<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.699> all<00:05:17.789> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
piece of the DVD case stuck it all the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.279 
piece of the DVD case stuck it all the
way<00:05:18.060> through<00:05:18.470> glued<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.900> what<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.110> does

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
way through glued it and what that does

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.890 
way through glued it and what that does
basically<00:05:22.949> is<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:24.150> can<00:05:24.270> do<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.479> a<00:05:24.539> different

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
basically is you can do it a different

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.570 
basically is you can do it a different
way<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.259> mean<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.650> didn't<00:05:26.190> have<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.430> use<00:05:26.550> a

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
way I mean you didn't have to use a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.770 
way I mean you didn't have to use a
switch<00:05:27.470> basically<00:05:28.470> this<00:05:28.740> switch<00:05:29.750> has<00:05:30.750> a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
switch basically this switch has a

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.439 
switch basically this switch has a
little<00:05:31.110> piece<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.099> plastic<00:05:32.940> sticking<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.330> the

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
little piece of plastic sticking on the

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.379 
little piece of plastic sticking on the
end<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.810> this<00:05:34.289> stops<00:05:34.620> up<00:05:34.830> against<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.669> when

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
end and this stops up against it so when

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.939 
end and this stops up against it so when
you're<00:05:36.510> filming<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.139> clip<00:05:37.440> doesn't<00:05:37.770> fall

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
you're filming you the clip doesn't fall

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.219 
you're filming you the clip doesn't fall
out<00:05:37.979> but<00:05:38.760> this<00:05:38.970> what<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.660> made<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.080> out<00:05:40.169> of

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
out but this what I made it out of

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.010 
out but this what I made it out of
doesn't<00:05:40.710> really<00:05:40.740> fall<00:05:41.039> out<00:05:41.190> anyway<00:05:41.340> so<00:05:42.270> after

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
doesn't really fall out anyway so after

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.399 
doesn't really fall out anyway so after
you've<00:05:43.380> done<00:05:43.530> that<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:45.360> just<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:46.080> can<00:05:46.199> put

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
you've done that you just you can put

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.860 
you've done that you just you can put
your<00:05:46.740> gun<00:05:46.860> back<00:05:47.280> together<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:48.000> I'll<00:05:48.539> show<00:05:48.840> you

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
your gun back together and I'll show you

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.080 
your gun back together and I'll show you
how<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.139> clip<00:05:49.470> works<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:51.570> when<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:51.780> can<00:05:52.080> get<00:05:52.260> it

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.370 

okay<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:57.979> you<00:05:58.979> can<00:05:59.130> see<00:05:59.159> my<00:05:59.460> switch<00:06:00.020> it's<00:06:01.020> glued

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
okay so you can see my switch it's glued

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.540 
okay so you can see my switch it's glued
down<00:06:01.650> here<00:06:01.949> what<00:06:02.849> you<00:06:03.000> do<00:06:03.180> is<00:06:04.010> just<00:06:05.010> bloody<00:06:05.250> and

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
down here what you do is just bloody and

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.879 
down here what you do is just bloody and
just<00:06:05.840> slide<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:07.020> in<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:08.250> what<00:06:08.789> happens<00:06:09.060> is

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
just slide it in and what happens is

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.240 
just slide it in and what happens is
that's<00:06:11.120> basically<00:06:12.120> when<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:12.840> want<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:13.860> slide<00:06:14.190> it

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
that's basically when I want to slide it

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.610 
that's basically when I want to slide it
back<00:06:14.550> this<00:06:14.820> way<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.810> now<00:06:15.960> it's<00:06:16.110> locked<00:06:16.409> in

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
back this way so now it's locked in

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.120 
back this way so now it's locked in
place<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.389> I<00:06:18.389> can't<00:06:18.870> really<00:06:19.110> get<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:19.979> out

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
place and I can't really get it out

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.580 
place and I can't really get it out
which<00:06:20.940> is<00:06:21.090> good<00:06:21.300> enough<00:06:21.539> for<00:06:21.659> me<00:06:21.780> and<00:06:22.289> when<00:06:22.500> you

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
which is good enough for me and when you

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.990 
which is good enough for me and when you
slide<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.400> switch<00:06:23.490> this<00:06:23.820> way<00:06:24.229> comes<00:06:25.229> out<00:06:26.000> so

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
slide the switch this way comes out so

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.120 
slide the switch this way comes out so
you<00:06:27.599> can<00:06:27.750> make<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.990> out<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.199> anything<00:06:28.409> pretty

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
you can make it out of anything pretty

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.730 
you can make it out of anything pretty
much<00:06:29.190> but<00:06:29.550> just<00:06:30.020> paint<00:06:31.020> it<00:06:31.110> black<00:06:31.289> at<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.590> end

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
much but just paint it black at the end

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.610 
much but just paint it black at the end
and<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.760> mean<00:06:33.599> you've<00:06:33.840> got<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:33.960> pretty<00:06:34.229> good<00:06:34.380> clip

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
and I mean you've got a pretty good clip

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.080 
and I mean you've got a pretty good clip
for<00:06:34.919> filming<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:36.330> you<00:06:36.419> just<00:06:36.539> take<00:06:37.469> a<00:06:37.529> few<00:06:37.770> shots

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
for filming so you just take a few shots

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.220 
for filming so you just take a few shots
check<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.210> clip<00:06:39.419> away

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
check the clip away

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.940 
check the clip away
and<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:41.070> mean<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.730> not<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.970> best<00:06:42.180> way<00:06:43.170> of

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
and I mean it's not the best way of

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.250 
and I mean it's not the best way of
doing<00:06:44.580> this<00:06:44.730> but<00:06:45.030> I<00:06:45.270> mean<00:06:46.230> it<00:06:46.410> works<00:06:47.900> so<00:06:48.900> I'll

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
doing this but I mean it works so I'll

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.370 
doing this but I mean it works so I'll
just<00:06:49.470> leave<00:06:49.980> a<00:06:50.040> few<00:06:50.310> photos<00:06:50.760> in<00:06:51.390> detail<00:06:51.960> photos

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
just leave a few photos in detail photos

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.650 
just leave a few photos in detail photos
of<00:06:52.500> how<00:06:52.620> I<00:06:52.650> did<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:53.010> and<00:06:53.130> then<00:06:53.510> hopefully<00:06:54.510> that

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
of how I did it and then hopefully that

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.420 
of how I did it and then hopefully that
helped<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.080> guys<00:06:55.260> hopefully<00:06:56.070> you<00:06:56.280> can<00:06:56.370> make
