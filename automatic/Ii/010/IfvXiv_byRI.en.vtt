00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.470
 exclusive on denis g 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.010
 because this knife is not yet on sale 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.340
 No, in principle , in the catalogs and on 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.450
 manufacturer's website 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.790
 it's called river here used 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.730
 new stick principles 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 You can already who follow the novelties for 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.000
 output can already understand that the handle 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.340
 us and the last run legs we almost 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.790
 full tank i.e. small shank 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.700
 wide enough somewhere two centimeters 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:11.930
 full length 1 riveted in point for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.100
 lanyard and accordingly excellent 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.369
 handle let's stop in more detail 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.300
 I understand that this is a drop point but not 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.979
 classical 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.399
 and the tip goes up a little bit 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.289
 creating here such a rib 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.840
 that is, the false blade nA it is 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:39.319
 the edge is not ground down with us 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.479
 identical all over concave 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:49.429
 start at about half 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:52.100
 not bad I think it will sand well and 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.429
 cut accordingly can even be 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.179
 we have a small planer 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:02.110
 here is a subdued notch and would have told 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.310
 podpaltsevoy emphasis Th you're so completely 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.410
 small knife is not cold 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.500
 weapons 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.020
 accordingly sold without any 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.810
 additional licenses 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 that plus the handle is very tenacious due to 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.230
 its shape the form is perfectly well 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.630
 almost perfect for holding something 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.200
 there is such a kind of oblong barrel with 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 thumb rests with side 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.099
 good 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:39.799
 hooks and ticks, respectively 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.799
 the original such a form under the fingers 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.970
 dwell on 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:55.909
 characteristics total length now i 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.909
 measure to be exact 26 cm 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:07.790
 210 meters the length of the blade we have 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:12.540
 matching 13 and a half 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.620
 Well, the handle full handle I will say this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.139
 one and a half 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.419
 apart from this little tail 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:24.829
 pieces that is knife enough i wouldn't 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.829
 said he was big but not small 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 convenient to be in hold because in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.419
 basically the arm is fully arm fully 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.879
 covers the handle without any on 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:42.139
 amines and so on with a glove I think 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.139
 will be generally super 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.459
 accordingly if if not to pass 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.650
 here 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.180
 some extra laces because 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.549
 that covers the palm at least 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.489
 my middle palm closes the hole 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.690
 for lanyard once again remind the model 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.030
 river I think so again they will 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.900
 ruler or maybe he alone will not 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.030
 I know I can not say for the price too 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.690
 I can not say yet I can say 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.340
 The following is that the knife is lightened despite 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.250
 as if its massiveness 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.759
 it weighs for a month and measure it 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.759
 0 grams 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:46.600
 207 grams and plus you need here 285 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:52.840
 a gram sheath along with a knife why 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:56.870
 easy enough well because 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.740
 accordingly there is falsehood knowingly 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.880
 that is, the metal removed the shank incomplete 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.450
 not the full width of the blades but a little smaller 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:14.150
 and the thickness of the blade in the butt between you 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:17.560
 other 37 millimeters in this knife well in 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.810
 In general, three and a half can be considered 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.920
 original interesting model will be me 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.530
 so I suppose another hunting model with 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.340
 developed emphasis but in principle and this 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:35.270
 enough for that is where it is possible 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.060
 take I think fishing some in 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.280
 hike well because the very shape of the blade 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.840
 how would she suppose that is it 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.330
 some kind of hike some kind of active 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.730
 Slag motion sensor well, in principle, here 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.440
 and anything on the hunt can be 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:57.170
 also someone will take and someone he 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.440
 I like it, I think you can take it off 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.500
 skins some well who does not like let us down 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 melee weapon yourself carry and so on 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:15.160
 This is basically short enough 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:19.220
 review of one of the new so let's say our 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.260
 Kizlyar feet companies are very interesting 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.510
 interesting handle is really tenacious 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.800
 more and more interesting handles 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:32.840
 guys will come so we will wait 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:35.630
 so let's say the following phenomena so far 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.490
 that we put it on 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:44.950
 tests we take you all subscribe 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.950
 put the huskies on everyone
