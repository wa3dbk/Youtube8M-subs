00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.980 

so<00:00:13.430> here's<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:13.790> fire<00:00:14.000> ant<00:00:14.270> germanium

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
so here's the fire ant germanium

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.690 
so here's the fire ant germanium
overdrive<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.160> controls<00:00:16.520> are<00:00:16.640> actually

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
overdrive the controls are actually

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.920 
overdrive the controls are actually
pretty<00:00:17.060> straightforward<00:00:17.330> if<00:00:17.690> you<00:00:17.750> think

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
pretty straightforward if you think

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.150 
pretty straightforward if you think
about<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.290> poke<00:00:19.099> then<00:00:19.369> turns<00:00:19.820> it<00:00:19.939> on<00:00:20.890> attack<00:00:21.890> is

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
about it poke then turns it on attack is

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.600 
about it poke then turns it on attack is
your<00:00:22.279> volume<00:00:22.430> byte<00:00:23.360> is<00:00:23.570> your<00:00:23.689> tone<00:00:24.430> burn<00:00:25.430> and

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
your volume byte is your tone burn and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.640 
your volume byte is your tone burn and
kill<00:00:25.759> are<00:00:26.029> two<00:00:26.270> separate<00:00:26.750> gained<00:00:27.199> controls

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
kill are two separate gained controls

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.109 
kill are two separate gained controls
that<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.800> can<00:00:27.890> switch<00:00:28.130> between<00:00:28.279> on<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:28.880> fly

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
that you can switch between on the fly

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.970 
that you can switch between on the fly
here<00:00:29.240> with<00:00:29.390> burn<00:00:29.570> or<00:00:29.720> kill<00:00:29.930> so<00:00:30.680> you<00:00:30.740> can<00:00:30.830> have

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
here with burn or kill so you can have

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.770 
here with burn or kill so you can have
two<00:00:31.490> different<00:00:31.640> levels<00:00:31.850> of<00:00:32.059> distortion<00:00:32.629> and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
two different levels of distortion and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.500 
two different levels of distortion and
you've<00:00:33.530> got<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.890> three-way<00:00:34.330> distortion<00:00:35.330> mode

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
you've got a three-way distortion mode

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.590 
you've got a three-way distortion mode
switch<00:00:35.780> here<00:00:36.160> which<00:00:37.160> gives<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.519> either<00:00:38.330> in

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
switch here which gives you either in

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.810 
switch here which gives you either in
first<00:00:38.840> position<00:00:39.820> germanium<00:00:41.290> overdrive

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
first position germanium overdrive

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.340 
first position germanium overdrive
second<00:00:43.820> position<00:00:44.180> get<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.899> silicon

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
second position get you a silicon

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.620 
second position get you a silicon
overdrive<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:46.430> third<00:00:46.940> position<00:00:47.360> gives<00:00:47.540> you

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
overdrive and third position gives you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.160 
overdrive and third position gives you
an<00:00:47.719> all<00:00:47.840> out<00:00:48.399> almost<00:00:49.399> fuzzy<00:00:50.170> over-the-top

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
an all out almost fuzzy over-the-top

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.310 
an all out almost fuzzy over-the-top
overdrive<00:00:52.629> so<00:00:53.629> let's<00:00:53.840> start<00:00:53.989> off<00:00:54.079> with<00:00:54.230> the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
overdrive so let's start off with the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.470 
overdrive so let's start off with the
first<00:00:54.469> position<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> germanium<00:00:55.329> turned<00:00:56.329> up<00:00:56.420> a

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
first position the germanium turned up a

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.330 
first position the germanium turned up a
little<00:00:56.539> bit<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.960> balance<00:00:57.379> out<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.530> clean

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
little bit to balance out the clean

00:00:58.340 --> 00:02:10.690 
little bit to balance out the clean
here's<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.879> clean<00:00:59.059> tone<00:00:59.180> by<00:00:59.329> itself

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000 

and<00:02:11.690> then<00:02:11.780> again<00:02:12.050> you've<00:02:12.260> got<00:02:12.290> two<00:02:12.740> different

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
and then again you've got two different

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.559 
and then again you've got two different
gains<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.490> which<00:02:13.640> are<00:02:13.790> identical<00:02:14.120> well

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
gains here which are identical well

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.020 
gains here which are identical well
somewhat<00:02:15.020> identical<00:02:15.530> let's<00:02:16.250> turn<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.430> kill

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
somewhat identical let's turn to kill

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.839 
somewhat identical let's turn to kill
all<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.660> way<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.110> turn<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> burn<00:02:18.849> back

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
all the way up and turn the burn back

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:35.729 
all the way up and turn the burn back
here

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.130 

let's<00:02:36.739> go<00:02:36.860> does<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.280> second<00:02:37.640> mode<00:02:37.760> here<00:02:41.140> this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
let's go does the second mode here this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.070 
let's go does the second mode here this
is<00:02:42.290> your<00:02:42.409> silicon<00:02:42.799> overdrive

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.150 

start<00:02:47.080> with<00:02:47.200> clean<00:02:47.440> first<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
start with clean first is to get the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:51.770 
start with clean first is to get the
idea<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.460> what<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.700> sounds<00:02:48.850> like

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.440 

again<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:52.900> can<00:03:53.020> set<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.320> up<00:03:53.380> differently<00:03:54.450> use

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
again we can set this up differently use

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:04.130 
again we can set this up differently use
kill<00:03:55.810> over<00:03:56.080> here<00:03:56.290> for<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.620> heavy<00:03:56.770> stuff

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.990 

and<00:04:05.140> burn<00:04:05.470> that's<00:04:05.800> kind<00:04:06.160> of<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.280> lighter

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
and burn that's kind of the lighter

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.879 
and burn that's kind of the lighter
stuff

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.770 

and<00:04:20.889> our<00:04:21.010> third<00:04:21.220> game<00:04:21.519> mode<00:04:21.820> isn't<00:04:22.480> all<00:04:22.600> out

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
and our third game mode isn't all out

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.800 
and our third game mode isn't all out
almost<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.470> fuzzy<00:04:25.200> clipping<00:04:26.200> mode<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:28.570> really

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
almost a fuzzy clipping mode it really

00:04:28.810 --> 00:05:25.140 
almost a fuzzy clipping mode it really
pushes<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.260> ant<00:04:29.410> hard

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.730 

and<00:05:25.840> again<00:05:26.050> with<00:05:26.169> us<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:26.320> can<00:05:26.440> switch<00:05:26.620> between

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
and again with us you can switch between

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:41.020 
and again with us you can switch between
the<00:05:27.040> two<00:05:27.070> games

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.170 

three<00:05:41.450> levels<00:05:41.720> of<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.870> game<00:05:42.020> on<00:05:42.380> fly<00:05:43.190> then<00:05:43.880> on

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
three levels of the game on fly then on

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.240 
three levels of the game on fly then on
the<00:05:44.480> inside<00:05:44.600> you<00:05:44.810> get<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.050> trim<00:05:45.320> pot<00:05:45.500> but<00:05:45.950> just

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
the inside you get a trim pot but just

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.910 
the inside you get a trim pot but just
the<00:05:46.640> voicing<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.360> kill<00:05:47.600> side<00:05:47.930> over<00:05:48.620> here

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
the voicing of the kill side over here

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.490 
the voicing of the kill side over here
right<00:05:49.880> now<00:05:50.060> it's<00:05:50.270> set<00:05:50.480> to<00:05:50.750> be<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.050> same<00:05:51.230> as<00:05:51.410> the

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
right now it's set to be the same as the

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.380 
right now it's set to be the same as the
Burnside<00:05:51.950> but<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.550> can<00:05:52.670> back<00:05:52.850> it<00:05:53.030> down<00:05:53.150> on<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
Burnside but you can back it down on the

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.490 
Burnside but you can back it down on the
inside<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:54.590> get<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.800> warmer<00:05:55.630> smoother<00:05:56.630> lead

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
inside to get a warmer smoother lead

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.080 
inside to get a warmer smoother lead
tone<00:05:57.740> for<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.490> kill<00:05:58.670> so<00:05:58.820> you<00:05:58.850> can<00:05:59.000> actually

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
tone for the kill so you can actually

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.550 
tone for the kill so you can actually
set<00:05:59.390> them<00:05:59.510> up<00:05:59.600> to<00:05:59.630> be<00:05:59.720> really<00:06:00.170> different<00:06:00.500> from

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
set them up to be really different from

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:14.810 
set them up to be really different from
each<00:06:00.680> other

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.880 

you
