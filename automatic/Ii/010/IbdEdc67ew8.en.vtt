00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
to exceed this temperature as the oil

never let the oil get above 400 degrees
just<00:04:24.230> keep<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:25.010> constant<00:04:25.220> watch<00:04:25.490> on<00:04:25.760> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
just keep a constant watch on the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.460 
just keep a constant watch on the
temperature<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.510> you'll<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.870> fine

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
temperature and you'll be fine

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.520 
temperature and you'll be fine
looks<00:04:27.980> like<00:04:28.190> about<00:04:28.370> 300<00:04:29.210> 55<00:04:29.840> degrees

looks like about 300 55 degrees
I'd<00:04:30.680> say<00:04:30.920> it's<00:04:31.070> perfect<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:31.850> we're<00:04:32.120> ready<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
I'd say it's perfect so we're ready to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.060 
I'd say it's perfect so we're ready to
lower<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.720> burden<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.200> oil<00:04:33.440> right<00:04:33.650> well

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
lower the burden to the oil right well

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.880 
lower the burden to the oil right well
why<00:04:34.700> don't<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:34.940> first<00:04:35.270> turn<00:04:35.870> off<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.320> flame

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
why don't you first turn off the flame

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.650 
why don't you first turn off the flame
you<00:04:37.100> see<00:04:37.280> if<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.520> should<00:04:37.760> spill<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> little<00:04:38.390> oil

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
you see if you should spill a little oil

you see if you should spill a little oil
over<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.900> side<00:04:39.230> there's<00:04:39.710> no<00:04:39.890> flame<00:04:40.220> left<00:04:40.520> to

over the side there's no flame left to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.390 
over the side there's no flame left to
catch<00:04:41.000> fire<00:04:41.380> lower<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.560> turkey<00:04:42.740> into<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> hot
