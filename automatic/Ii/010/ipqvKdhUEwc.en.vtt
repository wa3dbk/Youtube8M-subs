00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.099
 dear friends of 1000 ps we are 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.200
 us here at the eicma milan trade fair 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.740
 in italy the second big fair of the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 year 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 I'm standing here on the peter stand with michi 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 Fighter Sales Manager Austria and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.880
 he will tell us something about the enduros of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.529
 peter greatest hello tell me what 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 long lasts is good at last is ours 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.060
 motto for this year's eicma we 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 finally have the two-stroke sport a bus 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 here to show 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 It's already in the press 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 have been presented but sit here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 first time for the common audience live 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.309
 to see 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 we are extremely proud that he is the one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.860
 in the short time in the art 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.780
 could realize 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 we are well known 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.129
 powerful troop near by 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 Florence is sitting and that is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.680
 I would say extraordinarily well 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 Yes 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 what is there for technical innovations yes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.210
 So we are now since 2010 with 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 our own four- stroke engine 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 Sports segment actually very good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.260
 established 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 we have very very good feedback 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 a huge advantage beta is the market 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.210
 that we have this feedback very well 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.080
 can implement and that was also for 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 this year again the topic weight was sour 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.070
 the main premise that is the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.990
 enduros, so to speak, each part 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.930
 touched and we could do so in total 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.759
 four kilo rausholen what with what 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.090
 is relatively mature sport 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.680
 vehicles for you is a whole lot 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 in particular, we have completely new 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.299
 wheelsets that means lighter ones 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.689
 lighter rims lighter brake discs 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.810
 The swingarm stiffer and lighter so 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.030
 really many many details around easy 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 the vehicle is even lighter in handling 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.740
 to perform better and perform better 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 I would say a very high quality new one 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.009
 very nice digital instrument new 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 tank so also the thermics became massive 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.149
 here again and improved 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 revised to the here too 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.330
 increase performance 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.220
 All right and the engine stays that way 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.380
 as it is and has just been revised 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.570
 right there was just as said 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.429
 Feedback that we implement here directly 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 could 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.950
 as before detailed improvements 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.930
 all things also detail improvements 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 which also retrofitted for older models 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.190
 can be in particular 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 what that means startup behavior is concerned 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.459
 are now duos times 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.170
 unlike other vehicles below 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.760
 used in absolute extraneous conditions 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900
 you can not simulate everything and everything 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.260
 Therefore, the feedback from the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
 field very important in these all 2013 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.040
 been implemented and the new two-stroke 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.940
 motor also own production is successful 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.630
 Of course they can do the same 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.700
 driveability and also so ad adjustable 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.959
 that I am really a professional and a hobby 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.599
 drivers here a very broad spectrum 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.299
 picture can be wonderful so Peter has 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.560
 even now the trend for the second character and 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.560
 We thank the party
