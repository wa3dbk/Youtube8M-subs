 It 's not fun to have Koto, but my children and my offspring 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.060
 When I live a very pleasant life 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.560
 To have fun and I'm happy parents 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.560
 When you buy a good life 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.679
 U 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.989
 You can do it with very simple code. 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.989
 Parents are happy when their children are happy . 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 That's why it works . 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.710
 Let's see what we do today. We did all of our kids. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 Those who are here before you are all those who have children. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.720
 How do you feel when you get some of Ghana ? 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.160
 Good 5 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.160
 I like it now and then I get tears. 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:42.410
 Now from the day such as this message is three years, I see that we reflect on me 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.870
 I have to think. 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.870
 Did I really raise my child properly ? 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.549
 Children are not difficult 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:01.080
 When I reflect this on me, Mother's day I reflect on my own 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.040
 I find myself searching for myself 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.070
 I tried to 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.070
 Will my children be happy right now? 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.989
 My child is not happy how parents 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.989
 Enjoy and deepen 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.080
 Uh, this is not your parents either. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 If so, it is not the parent 2 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.120
 From the year 2013 onwards, 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.330
 For three years 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 Make your thoughts looking back on my own I've seen 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:46.710
 If the mentor has ever pointed to someone when it is day 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:50.210
 If I am right in my eyes, 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.210
 I will never experience difficulties. 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.720
 If I am a parent and I try to make a right effort on my child, 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.159
 I do not live hard now 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.159
 This is not hard to please. 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.930
 The child is having difficulty with something now. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.190
 If I see that I will have difficulty 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:22.630
 From now on, looking at myself once again 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:25.160
 When I look back at the child and say a word, 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.890
 Do not lift it. 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:33.340
 Now, try to catch my heart trying to work like Chicago 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.760
 I have to sell out again. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.760
 Uh will have to be think yoreo 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.060
 So I get a bouquet and get a cake and have a nice present since 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.709
 Laughed 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:57.409
 I have to tear the championship to 10 times the maximum. 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.860
 10 times is definitely coming to the chest I hear this message from now on 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.330
 From then on 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.330
 I'm going through this. 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:15.610
 It's very good when you bring your message to the world. 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.610
 When you make a mistake, you have a direct target. 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.180
 If I have not done anything in the world , 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.250
 Did it right 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.730
 I tried to take a little bit of this, 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.440
 and 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:39.090
 This group is to hold you, not one that's dying 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.810
 Now I know that this buteorado remarks doegetda strive to live a life 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.010
 I think only this paradigm is safe. 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.010
 Heaven helps himself 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:54.689
 If I do not know what I'm doing wrong now, 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.960
 And if you go in the wrong way of thinking, 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.960
 Is 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.410
 There is no such rule now . 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.870
 2 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:15.560
 Against the law of nature it has come back to the era of Political Science and Law, which applies directly malyijyo 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:20.990
 I have lived an era of contradiction at this time 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:26.960
 In the future, it says the argument enters the era of the advent of information law 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.100
 So I'm not sure that I have so little to live badly that lived fast 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.130
 Did not 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.860
 What little toad factor 3 years 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:38.210
 At that time, when I will be as this day, any event point out to me, trying me, 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.870
 Review 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:46.430
 Also, do not zip me when it's my birthday 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:51.520
 When I was a child, I Beam me again point out me 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:56.160
 It's a little bit like 10 minutes . 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:03.840
 This guy seems stiff to show the right laws, 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:06.140
 This applies to you if you try to make a dream, you change my mind. 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.140
 Discard 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.159
 So you can get a good breath away, and I released it I eoryeotdeon 

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:17.330
 Leave it to sickness 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:20.449
 This is 50,000 days. 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:26.030
 This is by my efforts. 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:27.199
 Smaller again my while I was full and as many as three years from 100 days 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.530
 Studying 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:36.340
 Jundamyeon you think we are a little people of this country have made efforts 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.340
 The energy changes. 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.909
 U 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:43.909
 All these damp winds start to change. 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:53.630
 So it open and get out some clear from the Republic of Korea community so 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:56.509
 This wave is the extension of humanity 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:07:00.680
 Then, in Hong-ik human ideology 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:05.310
 To Hongik the human spirit in the way human beings live out Hongik 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:11.370
 We have to make a little effort . 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:15.600
 Now that we have these things, now that we are celebrating Mother's Day 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:18.960
 In the past, when we were greeted with what we were, 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:24.090
 The Son of Man is there to welcome the opening of the future 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:28.470
 We have been trying for three years on the threshold of Yogi, and I have to tackle me. 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:34.880
 I try to fold everything, but all of my efforts are back to my dull aura. 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.880
 APA from the arguments heard're going difficult tteungeo seam turning 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.129
 Children, do not be a tree 5 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:47.280
 The hardship of their children is my heart. 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:52.770
 This is not their fault. 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.569
 My children are in Ghana 2 9 I broadcast myself and treat my children properly 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.250
 People contrast.
