to learn how to tie this knot is of
great<00:00:06.529> advantage<00:00:07.100> as<00:00:07.310> to<00:00:07.870> its<00:00:08.870> versatile<00:00:09.469> it

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
great advantage as to its versatile it

great advantage as to its versatile it
could<00:00:09.830> be<00:00:09.920> used<00:00:10.160> in<00:00:10.340> many<00:00:10.790> applications<00:00:10.940> of

could be used in many applications of

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.689 
could be used in many applications of
like<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:12.619> said<00:00:12.830> for<00:00:13.129> a<00:00:13.369> loop<00:00:13.969> for<00:00:14.270> tying<00:00:14.539> the

yes<00:00:35.809> it's<00:00:36.499> very<00:00:36.800> versatile<00:00:37.339> like<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:37.579> say<00:00:37.850> you

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
yes it's very versatile like I say you

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.459 
yes it's very versatile like I say you
could<00:00:38.210> use<00:00:38.269> it<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.690> tie<00:00:38.839> different<00:00:39.289> not

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
could use it to tie different not

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.889 
could use it to tie different not
different<00:00:40.129> lines<00:00:40.609> together<00:00:40.969> different<00:00:41.719> color

have<00:02:16.769> used<00:02:17.630> my<00:02:18.630> fingers<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.440> bring<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> two

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
have used my fingers to bring the two

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.229 
have used my fingers to bring the two
lines<00:02:20.579> together<00:02:20.849> on<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.390> top<00:02:22.700> now<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:24.000> all

lines together on the top now then all

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.870 
lines together on the top now then all
we<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.470> twist<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.250> two<00:02:26.430> lines<00:02:26.640> together
