00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.650
 in the end I will tell you multimedia 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.660
 capabilities by itar tass 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.119
 ants including repairs 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.839
 the first is the music player 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.320
 the music player is here only 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.929
 now was to find yes what he should 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.489
 be 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.159
 cable and business here he is a music player 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.039
 it is essentially standard 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.299
 users at the beginning of it can 

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:32.800
 show you how the dynamics work 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 and you listen to m 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 what a noise because of g 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
 but pretty loud and although if 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060
 almost zero 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.900
 good dynamics there are all sorts 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 Rushha lakes language is much better if 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 appropriate listen 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.630
 sound more Samara becomes and we can 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 connect headphones and then we have baidin 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.570
 the price will be given more 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.270
 rise only in headphones 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.530
 Naturally bad about country very much 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.450
 settings 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.490
 basil low frequency helene 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.040
 treble and so on and so forth then 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.310
 is preloaded 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.310
 travel is very good sums in 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.050
 principally better 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.130
 percentage low quite high too 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.650
 nothing like this is the percentage that is with 10 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.960
 uah 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.799
 wed radio 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.829
 now we have no look on the road 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.990
 also usually exactly the same as in 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 patronage of not in this city umd 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.769
 is scanning the frequencies of years 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.689
 remembered in favor let's we cancel 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.509
 so that he did not look for us for a long time 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.189
 I hear the sound coming on the construction sites so the speaker 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.109
 special 45 except vodka 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.269
 abaya 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.059
 not 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.379
 in the Crimea, special services pretty loud 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.669
 not 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:48.839
 well, there is further formation 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:53.999
 respectively poison respectively nv 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.329
 you can remember a lot 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.909
 radio station responsible director 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.299
 phones for example this is the same 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.369
 most but cues 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.939
 that they will help the station management 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.829
 metro falconers and development on her 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.629
 own year at the reception 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.230
 also very pleased so it is not 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.879
 almost completely supported 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.219
 video and audio codecs as you can see in 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.299
 In this case, I remember the memory card 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.489
 different did not see in different as long as 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.159
 Kohno for example this is a company video 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.859
 aar this also saw a swimsuit this mp4 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.250
 citizens hurry 4280 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.080
 at 725 is our peak rule ahead 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.329
 expressively 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.590
 this religion is the peak but then I will begin 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.769
 for example because of the unusual myth of his 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 not 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.789
 bank 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.209
 it was to be 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.469
 saw olimp we stupid size 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.229
 accordingly you can switch the super stardust 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.229
 the sound is deeper 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.499
 prp 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.989
 interesting effects next with 

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:25.689
 switching means you need another important 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:27.330
 percent 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.000
 let's see the most interesting thing 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 720 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.990
 bezrukov will leave 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.600
 it is very good that these verses and prose 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.560
 were able to install air craft 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.270
 cushion 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.240
 that is, you can not bother ii t 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.069
 watch any movies including 1 p 4 to 9 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.110
 preferred foreheads and so on and so forth 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.280
 reproduces without any problems 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.669
 sound codec is also present here 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:26.550
 probably all multimedia 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.449
 possible percentage of this defeat target 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.049
 before noon saw 

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:33.860
 all thanks to all the taverns
