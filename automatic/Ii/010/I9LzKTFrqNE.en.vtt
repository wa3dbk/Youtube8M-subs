00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.360
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.790
 and today we look at the excellent fight 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.970
 on t30 second on the map 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.279
 el-Khaluf will talk to you like despite 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.200
 no matter what dragging the whole team 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.720
 merged we will talk about several such 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.170
 nuances well and just look at 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.050
 really smart fight where t32 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.730
 being there almost one for all 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.559
 team dragged 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.289
 but let's not spoil this card 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.239
 Al Khaluf, by the way, I want to say yes 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.949
 we have recently written to developers 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.980
 tell me where you found them 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.899
 tunnel maps that's where exactly show 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.280
 poke a finger Well, let's say yes that 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.039
 same el Khaluf squares a1 a2 b1 b2 here 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.989
 just a tunnel where art will throw me and 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.880
 our hero quietly stands there from the tower 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.850
 something throws us understandable in this battle 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.920
 then the arts and no but when she is she 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.540
 there just do not put it on one side to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.330
 it love well there comes there on 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.510
 Is it a wafer on t57 heavy and just 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.670
 with impunity for all to throw on to d 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.980
 so to speak but it is again a little bit 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.170
 imbalance there for st chic for lt chic 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.320
 such places need to be cleaned I think but 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.140
 now it's not about that well in our tunnels 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.900
 the hero has fought a little and understands that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.600
 frontal him something my husband did not shoot at 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.420
 while the whole team merges 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.090
 Absolutely the score is already 15 spots wanted 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.640
 say mi5 12 to all practically 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.610
 no one merged peaked cap there practically 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.100
 did not shoot the whole center gave 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 the only position that is a little bit 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.030
 at least not where it is protected 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.780
 our hero stayed but with our hero 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.050
 still have t 69 which is well with all my might 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.720
 trying to try there to keep the defense on 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.180
 base in principle at least it does not merge 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.610
 In the first minutes of the battle, well, in general, you already 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.069
 You know what will smell like fried 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 and that's what i would like to talk to you about 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.599
 how to drag in such minutes when you 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.340
 understand that there are no allies left 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.370
 at all 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.290
 yes, enemy tanks always have enemy tanks 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 big syndrome is on now i'm 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.010
 which I have said many times when you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.510
 seeing that through the green Well 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.489
 imagine yes you are playing now for 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.180
 the enemy team will see that the enemies 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.519
 I mean , our allies, well, you are 332 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.110
 all that remains is only two tanks and what are we 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.080
 just already rush in we understand that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.150
 victory in the sleeve and and we use such 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 moments of green ladies syndrome big 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.830
 pipirki it look what you 69 enemy 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.920
 in general, does he just like that? 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.069
 damn my allies will drag to Dan 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.920
 let's jump off the mountain and just 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.780
 die before the principle and what happens here 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.180
 this should never be done 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 ram cheeks last there even if 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 you cadet on t69 some ram 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.129
 extra 2 and pyshechki need to shoot t30 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.930
 the second in this case is never necessary 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.510
 include this big syndrome 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.400
 pipirki fight to the last, even if 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 I had a green account of myself 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.290
 such situations up what about seemingly in 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.329
 I have already relaxed our favor 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.370
 In this he can never do this if 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.350
 you want really good wines 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.600
 rate 60 and 70 plus we see that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.489
 we get t 28 which is very dangerous 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.380
 which gun is the worst which us 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.470
 punches without much difficulty well and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.569
 stock is not a problem but everyone is there 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.760
 scattered up in the corner of the map our hero 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.620
 returns to the base I ride 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 a little awaits his opponents that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.040
 principle comes to you and here's just 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.930
 racing across the field 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.389
 he is no longer acting tactically he is not 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.819
 trying to let one and two go 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.400
 through some rocks he just rides on 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.739
 field and why friends yes because damn 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.959
 something green to us one enemy then stayed 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.120
 what to fear at night allies there 10 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.819
 man i 'm going around the field and so here 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.340
 suck on it t 32 but nothing allies 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.060
 themselves cope escapes sherman on 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.220
 land mines 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.220
 but Sherman yes of course such a machine 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.780
 unique yes he has a weak gun 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.099
 relatively well at least after 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.709
 nerf to whom cumulative 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:23.200
 but fugue si mi he is at least some 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.750
 but our 30 second blows but 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.170
 again rush on t30 second 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.060
 Well, 8 levla heavy from and being with point 6 but 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.640
 again this is not reasonably possible through 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.830
 these mines and somewhere in the distance 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.020
 work and more friends one drawback 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.910
 besides big pipirki syndrome 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.280
 such that you already despair 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.860
 and just give up positions or write what 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 someone africa as in this case will 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.560
 write that enemy africa is-3 of this 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.420
 also never need to do because 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.830
 he is an enemy he even if he drags never 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.140
 know someone and while he will be afraid 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.570
 if you say well crush pass all 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.850
 positions but it will be easier for him 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.770
 win and you don't even have a draw if 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.810
 to draw out would be very nice therefore 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.090
 never write never despair 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.580
 in general, and here our hero is already going to the side 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.190
 enemy base remains two opponents 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.310
 Vekashka and Vekashka rides look 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.140
 She is also a great tool for ours. 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.330
 the hero is 205 x n just 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.380
 turns around and look sharply now 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.230
 there will be a moment 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.720
 has time and no penetration has passed but this 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.910
 Now our hero is about mahi too 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.700
 It comes and now it punches and leaves 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.440
 only 87 margin of safety 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.390
 guns enough to even pierce in the forehead 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.150
 our hero comes down trying to kill this 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.220
 shit all goes to the side without damage and 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.740
 see now what will be beautiful 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.870
 Moment Shot Wakashka and Shot Our Hero 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.960
 just going to her sideways 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.690
 of the guard to move laterally substituting 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.840
 under the cat you just shoot on the go 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.940
 at a distance of 300 meters falls and 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.490
 breaks well and here ap again 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.040
 tips say that from 3 but for now in 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.479
 principle is true but never 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.060
 worth talking about it you need to watch and 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.190
 few seconds left if at t32 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.380
 Ours was not sure of that of 3 of a 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.560
 cup maybe there would be a draw 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.540
 enemy it would be much nicer here 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.790
 such a battle t32 handled requests 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.040
 against the whole team hope you 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.900
 I liked all the luck in the randomness to 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.140
 see you soon I was a crane bye 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.140
 until
