00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
with my phone and I figured it out the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.839 
with my phone and I figured it out the
problem<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.240> was<00:00:09.330> having<00:00:09.389> was<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
problem that I was having was that the

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.150 
problem that I was having was that the
volume<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.200> such<00:00:13.200> things<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.710> notifications

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
volume of such things as notifications

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840 
volume of such things as notifications
ringtones<00:00:15.230> Sarah<00:00:16.230> were<00:00:17.010> not<00:00:17.220> working<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
ringtones Sarah were not working I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.529 
ringtones Sarah were not working I
wasn't<00:00:18.660> able<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.869> hear<00:00:19.350> any<00:00:20.180> notifications<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
wasn't able to hear any notifications it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
wasn't able to hear any notifications it
the<00:00:21.869> sound<00:00:22.140> seemed<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> gotten<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.189> low

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the sound seemed to have gotten so low

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.830 
the sound seemed to have gotten so low
so<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.000> thought<00:00:24.180> there<00:00:24.330> was<00:00:24.449> something<00:00:24.600> wrong

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so I thought there was something wrong

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540 
so I thought there was something wrong
maybe<00:00:25.080> possibly<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.890> speaker<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.430> my

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
maybe possibly what my speaker on my

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.609 
maybe possibly what my speaker on my
phone<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> turned<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.410> wasn't

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
phone but it turned out that it wasn't

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.630 
phone but it turned out that it wasn't
anything<00:00:29.400> wrong<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.099> actually

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
anything wrong with that and it actually

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
anything wrong with that and it actually
was<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> setting<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.010> hopefully<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
was with the setting so hopefully this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950

I had to do and you know that's how

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.010 
I had to do and you know that's how
you'll<00:02:14.580> test<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.180> when<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.510> fix<00:02:15.810> those

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.160 
you'll test it to when you fix those
volumes<00:02:16.500> um<00:02:17.120> you'll<00:02:18.120> actually<00:02:18.300> hear<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> louder

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.600 
volumes um you'll actually hear a louder
sound<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> did<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.510> yeah<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:23.340> should

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
sound then you did so yeah it should

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.410 
sound then you did so yeah it should
work<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.680> hopefully<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:26.070> does<00:02:26.250> um<00:02:26.700> if

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420

it doesn't I really don't know what else
to<00:02:29.100> say<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.900> should<00:02:31.170> definitely<00:02:31.320> work

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
to say but that should definitely work

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.070 
to say but that should definitely work
