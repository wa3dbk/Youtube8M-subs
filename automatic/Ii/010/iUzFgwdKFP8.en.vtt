00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.167
 9.4 In the update, the game has not changed much. 

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.767
 But still important 

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:16.667
 These changes are: new combat format, new fortress mode, and a new historical map: Stalingrad 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.667
 Learn more about this video! 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.300
 The changes in the team's combat mode are not only big, but also amazing. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400
 The combat mode itself has also changed. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.667
 It is now called attack/defense. 

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:36.533
 In the attack mode, one team attacks and the other team guards 

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.200
 To be fair, each team must protect both bases at the same time. 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.533
 Base points are divided into parallel points and are not added together. 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.467
 To win, you must occupy one of the bases. 

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.733
 The team lineup will be even more spectacular 

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.367
 Today's battle points are 54 

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:55.700
 There is now a fixed tank combination 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.400
 The combination is: five 8th-order vehicles plus two 7th or 6th 8th order plus one 6th order 

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.033
 &gt;&gt; Map 

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.733
 Meet the new map: Stalingrad 

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.967
 This is a historical map that reflects most of the city's layout. 

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:19.067
 The urban landscape is full of unrecognizable turmoil due to years of war--damaged buildings, piles of brick rubble and craters 

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.167
 In some places, the ground is broken down by the trenches. 

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:24.700
 a steep slope stretches along the river into the distance 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.267
 So it became a very convenient offensive location 

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:30.700
 The railway provides a defensive foothold 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.267
 There are several roads on both sides of the map. 

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.933
 This side is more suitable for quick breakthrough 

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.600
 At the center of the map is a low square building 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.133
 Here we expect to see a lot of fierce crossfire 

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.733
 &gt;&gt; Fortress 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.267
 The function of the fortress is further expanded 

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.967
 If you can raise the fortress to level 5 or above 

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:55.967
 You can also attack and plunder the bastions of other guilds. 

00:01:56.067 --> 00:02:02.200
 Please use the film "Fort Construction Guide: From 5 to 10" to learn more. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.133
 &gt;&gt;Chariot 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.500
 The parameters of Ð¢-34-3 have changed. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.267
 The filling speed will be lowered from 14.4 seconds to 13.4 seconds. 

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.733
 When the turret is rotated, the expansion of the chariot is reduced by 25%. 

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:26.167
 The blood volume of the AT 15A expelled chariot increased from 850 to 1050 

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.533
 And its biggest fighting class will fall to eighth order 

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:30.633
 Explained 

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.000
 I wish everyone good luck on the battlefield!
