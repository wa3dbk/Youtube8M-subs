we<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:21.010> put<00:03:21.220> kazoo<00:03:22.000> counter<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> cliffs<00:03:23.140> in

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
we can put kazoo counter the cliffs in

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.200 
we can put kazoo counter the cliffs in
which<00:03:23.890> i<00:03:24.040> think<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.340> actually<00:03:24.700> kind<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.060> cool

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
which i think is actually kind of a cool

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.360 
which i think is actually kind of a cool
card<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:26.230> again<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.650> doesn't<00:03:26.860> change<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
card but again it doesn't change the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.810 
card but again it doesn't change the
deck<00:03:27.580> in<00:03:27.760> any<00:03:28.000> way<00:03:28.270> shape<00:03:28.300> or<00:03:28.720> form<00:03:29.820> then

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
deck in any way shape or form then

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.120 
deck in any way shape or form then
moving<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.270> we<00:03:31.420> have<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.840> chroma<00:03:32.320> angel<00:03:32.740> of<00:03:32.860> fury

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
moving on we have a chroma angel of fury

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.420 
moving on we have a chroma angel of fury
so<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:33.820> change<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> deck<00:03:34.360> um<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:35.250> no<00:03:36.250> way

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
so it can change the deck um in no way

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.190 
so it can change the deck um in no way
