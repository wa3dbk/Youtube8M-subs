more<00:03:28.989> definitely<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.370> gameplay<00:03:30.729> is

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
more definitely and the gameplay is

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.659 
more definitely and the gameplay is
actually<00:03:31.510> coming<00:03:32.349> close<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.709> an<00:03:33.010> end<00:03:33.250> i<00:03:33.430> think

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
actually coming close to an end i think

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.729 
actually coming close to an end i think
i<00:03:33.760> fast-forwarded<00:03:34.720> little<00:03:35.349> through<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
i fast-forwarded little through the

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.649 
i fast-forwarded little through the
chopper<00:03:36.129> gunner<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:37.150> that's<00:03:37.359> I<00:03:37.599> think

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
chopper gunner because that's I think

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.689 
chopper gunner because that's I think
that's<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.169> most<00:03:38.349> blowing<00:03:38.769> boring<00:03:39.400> not

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
that's the most blowing boring not

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:45.110 
that's the most blowing boring not
bowing<00:03:39.970> part<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.139> commentaries<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:43.150> just<00:03:43.540> I

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
bowing part of commentaries it's just I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.699 
bowing part of commentaries it's just I
guess<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.269> wasn't<00:03:46.510> my<00:03:46.750> first<00:03:46.930> attack<00:03:47.319> dogs<00:03:47.560> is

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
guess I wasn't my first attack dogs is

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.490 
guess I wasn't my first attack dogs is
that<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:47.889> used<00:03:48.159> it<00:03:48.370> five<00:03:48.579> times<00:03:48.819> hmm<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.840> must<00:03:50.290> be

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
that I used it five times hmm I must be

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.740 
that I used it five times hmm I must be
out<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:51.069> or<00:03:51.220> something<00:03:51.449> yeah<00:03:52.449> I<00:03:52.569> think

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
out of it or something yeah I think

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.270 
out of it or something yeah I think
that's<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.139> most<00:03:53.319> boring<00:03:53.680> part<00:03:53.889> is<00:03:54.099> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
that's the most boring part is the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.819 
that's the most boring part is the
chopper<00:03:54.639> gunner<00:03:55.169> because<00:03:56.169> nobody<00:03:56.500> wants<00:03:56.769> to

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829
