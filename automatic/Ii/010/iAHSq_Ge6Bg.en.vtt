common misconception that granite is
just<00:00:48.530> grey<00:00:48.920> like<00:00:49.190> you'd<00:00:49.339> see<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.580> curbstone

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
just grey like you'd see on a curbstone

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270 
just grey like you'd see on a curbstone
but<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:50.750> literally<00:00:50.960> comes<00:00:51.230> in<00:00:51.470> blues<00:00:51.800> reds

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
but it literally comes in blues reds

but it literally comes in blues reds
greens<00:00:52.790> blacks<00:00:53.269> every<00:00:53.629> color<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.900> could

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
greens blacks every color you could

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.570 
greens blacks every color you could
think<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:54.379> directly<00:00:54.830> out<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.190> earth<00:00:55.280> and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
think of directly out of the earth and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.160 
think of directly out of the earth and
that's<00:00:56.120> what<00:00:56.239> people<00:00:56.480> are<00:00:56.540> often<00:00:56.690> surprised

that's what people are often surprised
when<00:00:57.350> they<00:00:57.440> come<00:00:57.589> here<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.010> see<00:00:58.159> how<00:00:58.280> many

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
when they come here is to see how many

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.479 
when they come here is to see how many
different<00:00:58.760> colors<00:00:59.000> are<00:00:59.089> actually<00:00:59.390> available

different colors are actually available

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.460 
different colors are actually available
it's<00:01:01.489> very<00:01:01.670> important<00:01:02.150> to<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:02.720> you<00:01:02.900> see<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
it's very important to that you see the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.990 
it's very important to that you see the
actual<00:01:03.739> slabs<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.250> we're<00:01:04.430> going<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.610> use<00:01:04.790> to

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
actual slabs that we're going to use to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.630 
actual slabs that we're going to use to
fabricate<00:01:05.510> your<00:01:05.659> countertop<00:01:06.430> because<00:01:07.430> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
fabricate your countertop because the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.570 
fabricate your countertop because the
fact<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.650> stone<00:01:09.650> pulled<00:01:10.010> out<00:01:10.159> of<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.370> same

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
fact is a stone pulled out of the same

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.390 
fact is a stone pulled out of the same
quarry<00:01:10.880> six<00:01:11.390> months<00:01:11.630> apart<00:01:11.930> may<00:01:12.710> look<00:01:13.010> very

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
quarry six months apart may look very

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.010 
quarry six months apart may look very
different<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.659> because<00:01:14.810> you're

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
different so just because you're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.440 
different so just because you're
ordering<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.380> certain<00:01:15.710> color<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.760> color<00:01:17.120> may

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
ordering a certain color that color may

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.120 
ordering a certain color that color may
not<00:01:17.750> be<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.350> know<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.830> order<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.070> from

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
not be you know you if you order it from

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.700 
not be you know you if you order it from
a<00:01:19.280> sample<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:20.390> may<00:01:20.630> not<00:01:20.840> look<00:01:21.049> anything<00:01:21.439> like

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
a sample that may not look anything like

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.170 
a sample that may not look anything like
the<00:01:21.920> slab<00:01:22.189> that<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.460> get<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.820> that's<00:01:22.969> why

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the slab that you get and that's why

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.020 
the slab that you get and that's why
we've<00:01:23.960> increased<00:01:24.200> our<00:01:24.439> stock<00:01:24.770> here<00:01:25.219> so<00:01:25.729> that

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
you can come in look at the exact slab

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.340 
you can come in look at the exact slab
we're<00:01:29.090> going<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.270> use<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.659> fabricate<00:01:30.110> your

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
we're going to use to fabricate your

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.130 
we're going to use to fabricate your
counter<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:32.030> look<00:01:32.180> at<00:01:32.329> it<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.570> say

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
counter and you can look at it and say

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.289 
counter and you can look at it and say
geez<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.250> part<00:01:34.490> over<00:01:34.700> here<00:01:34.969> I'd<00:01:35.119> like

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
make it ourselves available so you can

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.550 
make it ourselves available so you can
actually<00:01:43.939> lay<00:01:44.060> your<00:01:44.180> own<00:01:44.329> templates<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:45.350> on

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
actually lay your own templates right on

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.340 
actually lay your own templates right on
the<00:01:45.829> slab<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.609> determine<00:01:47.359> where<00:01:47.810> your<00:01:47.960> Island

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
the slab and determine where your Island

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.690 
the slab and determine where your Island
is<00:01:48.409> going<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.710> where<00:01:48.979> L<00:01:49.219> shape<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
is going to be where L shape is going to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.160 
is going to be where L shape is going to
be<00:01:49.789> where<00:01:49.909> your<00:01:50.090> seam<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.630> be<00:01:50.780> where
