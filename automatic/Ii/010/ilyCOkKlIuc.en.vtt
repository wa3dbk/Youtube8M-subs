00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that was it to be expected and then you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130

Boston Celtics at the end of the game
you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:37.020> always<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:37.530> been<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
you know and he always has been and so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
you know and he always has been and so
to<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.430> play<00:01:41.850> him<00:01:42.000> during<00:01:42.240> those<00:01:42.479> five

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to not play him during those five

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.990 
to not play him during those five
minutes<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> been<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.579> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
minutes would have been I think very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
minutes would have been I think very
very<00:01:45.149> short-sighted<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
very short-sighted and I think that you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.340 
very short-sighted and I think that you
know<00:01:49.799> he<00:01:50.340> also<00:01:50.490> knows<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.720> trust<00:01:52.200> him

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to make big plays and and you know he

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
to make big plays and and you know he
made<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> great<00:01:55.619> passes<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.369> came<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.980 
made a lot of great passes we came up a
little<00:01:56.909> short<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.509> he<00:01:57.630> came<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
little short and then he came up a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.240 
little short and then he came up a
little<00:01:58.049> short<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.469> shots<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> be

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little short on shots but that's to be

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
little short on shots but that's to be
expected<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.030> again<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> don't<00:02:01.200> expect

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
think about that first game you know

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.400 
think about that first game you know
that<00:03:05.070> first<00:03:05.310> name<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.410> your

that first name and it is like your

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
that first name and it is like your
first<00:03:07.680> NBA<00:03:08.130> game<00:03:08.459> coming<00:03:09.030> back<00:03:09.180> from<00:03:09.300> an

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
first NBA game coming back from an

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.300
