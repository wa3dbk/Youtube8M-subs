00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 Unfortunately, many people including 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.650
 stupid people today, too, correctly 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 I understand that today's currency 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 like a dollar on absolutely unacceptable 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.220
 need some alternatives and here they are 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.930
 offer to return to the gold 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.390
 standard in particular 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.640
 one of these active preachers 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.300
 gold standard is german 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 sterligov 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 day in St. Petersburg was a meeting with him and when 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 I knew him not personally like this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 say from the screen carts me he in many 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 aspects seemed constructive 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.950
 man but after a personal meeting i 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 Of course I was disappointed in him and realized that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.900
 he certainly doesn't understand the most 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 elementary most primitive things 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 suffice it to say that you are with him a little 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.580
 just touched 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 problems of theology so after three 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.049
 days from the TV screen here for the whole 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.240
 the country has responded about me as I say 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.930
 met in St. Petersburg with the rector 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.840
 huge 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.720
 university oh my god what is it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.020
 a dense man he is still not yet 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.780
 I realized that Jesus Christ is God, but here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 about to tire here at this level 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.660
 when there are arguments and such public 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 assessments but that says a lot that is 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 for those who understand the questions today 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.740
 theology who understand means the bible 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 and quran and buddhism 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:11.009
 who understand what faith in god is and what 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.620
 such faith god but for those here such 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.670
 approaches are really a little bit 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.320
 anecdotally even 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 but he is a gold standard preacher and 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.360
 even minted gold coins like 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.780
 we know and sells our gorgeous 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.570
 products only for his money he 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.600
 says that for your fucking money, I 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.880
 you will not sell anything you eat here 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.100
 the waste that is on the shelves 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.850
 shopping is something that is not suitable for 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.030
 power supply 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.270
 but here he is largely in general right 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.650
 because today food 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.840
 turned into a huge business and she 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.720
 not oriented to the interests and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.550
 human health but interesting 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.000
 focused on making money but 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.260
 the problem is gold is that amount 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.660
 Gold is limited to the amount of commodity 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.550
 mass steadily grows and grows very 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.560
 fast and so credit and financial 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.490
 system built on the dollar she 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.820
 unstable 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.860
 we need not some stability dollar 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.470
 this is the most unstable situation because 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.130
 that you cannot print money if u 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.400
 you have no gold 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.720
 can provide 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.940
 equivalent coverage is cash 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.700
 the masses because you have no gold you 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.270
 tell me how gold is related to 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.130
 mass of goods up to no and if some 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.070
 product that is directly related to 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.200
 commodity mass yes it is electricity that's 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.170
 through electricity can unmistakably 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.320
 calculate gross domestic product 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.610
 if you have electricity consumption 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.390
 increases means volumes grow 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.420
 production 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.700
 but assuming that efficiency is less 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.890
 consumer production is preserved 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.570
 systems are the same here how many you 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.400
 electricity filed at the entrance 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.010
 production consumer system 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.170
 so much at the exit of goods in proportion 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.290
 this quantity you will receive the goods and 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:21.060
 so this is a radical difference from 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:25.940
 gold well after all 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 views on the gold standard, though they 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.480
 conveying the thought there of the 19th century but it is not 21 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.700
 century but they are due only to absolute 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.520
 the absurdity of what is happening 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.280
 today because if you draw 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.740
 the schedule is very simple such a schedule 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.900
 emissions of world currencies during 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:52.050
 last 100 years even thousands since 1694 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.690
 when for the first time the bank of england printed not 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.550
 secured money so here if you 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.610
 look at this graph then you will see 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.830
 what's the last four years connected 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.700
 states 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.070
 imitated dollars times probably in 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.530
 a half or two more than for all previous 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.880
 100 years old then there is this curve 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.820
 exponential came out in its 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.130
 vertical phase and itâ€™s understandable that 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.470
 this absolute nonsense happens this 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.830
 called robbing everyone else 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.669
 through increasing the amount of money in 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.979
 one of the countries of the world 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.070
 in my opinion 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.410
 proposal for the gold standard they 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.950
 they are ridiculous 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.560
 but they are related to two more orders 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.620
 more ridiculous 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.770
 absurdly things that are happening today with 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.850
 Dollar mass learn more on
