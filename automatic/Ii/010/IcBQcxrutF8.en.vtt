too<00:04:50.480> bad<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.930> be<00:04:51.050> true<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:51.320> day<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
too bad to be true that day and with the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.000 
too bad to be true that day and with the
liquid<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.660> type<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.140> can<00:04:54.290> almost<00:04:54.440> give<00:04:54.770> him<00:04:54.950> a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
liquid a type you can almost give him a

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.070 
liquid a type you can almost give him a
second<00:04:55.340> chance<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.390> betting<00:04:56.660> suggests

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
second chance and the betting suggests

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.750 
second chance and the betting suggests
actually<00:04:57.350> still<00:04:57.560> only<00:04:57.680> about<00:04:57.800> 20<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.430> 1<00:04:58.580> in<00:04:58.700> the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
actually still only about 20 to 1 in the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.240 
actually still only about 20 to 1 in the
market<00:04:59.210> so<00:04:59.810> as<00:05:00.440> much<00:05:00.740> as<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:00.950> was<00:05:01.100> such<00:05:01.220> a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
market so as much as that was such a

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.710 
market so as much as that was such a
Peavy<00:05:01.580> was<00:05:01.880> too<00:05:01.970> bad<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.180> be<00:05:02.330> true<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.660> do

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
Peavy was too bad to be true and I do

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.300 
Peavy was too bad to be true and I do
believe<00:05:03.140> that<00:05:03.290> Tom<00:05:03.710> screwed<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.100> was<00:05:04.190> almost

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
believe that Tom screwed and was almost

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.980 
believe that Tom screwed and was almost
trying<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.820> use<00:05:05.030> him<00:05:05.240> for<00:05:05.270> stamina<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:05.900> it

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
trying to use him for stamina and it

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.570 
trying to use him for stamina and it
didn't<00:05:06.230> suit<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.530> horse<00:05:06.710> yeah<00:05:07.130> i<00:05:07.340> think<00:05:07.460> it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
didn't suit the horse yeah i think it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.100 
didn't suit the horse yeah i think it
was<00:05:07.640> actually<00:05:07.880> better<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.210> go<00:05:08.570> back<00:05:08.780> but<00:05:08.930> you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
was actually better you go back but you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.380 
was actually better you go back but you
do<00:05:09.380> go<00:05:09.560> back<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.220> children<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.669> victory<00:05:11.150> i

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
do go back to the children and victory i

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.440 
do go back to the children and victory i
think<00:05:11.630> was<00:05:11.720> right<00:05:11.810> about<00:05:11.990> New<00:05:12.169> Year's<00:05:12.320> Day

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
think was right about New Year's Day

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.120 
think was right about New Year's Day
that<00:05:14.450> didn't<00:05:14.780> talk<00:05:14.900> too<00:05:15.110> much<00:05:15.290> because<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:16.010> was

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
that didn't talk too much because it was

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.250 
that didn't talk too much because it was
a<00:05:16.160> three<00:05:16.400> or<00:05:16.490> four<00:05:16.640> minor<00:05:16.790> event<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.360> focus

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
a three or four minor event and focus

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.630 
a three or four minor event and focus
and<00:05:18.380> had<00:05:18.470> another<00:05:18.680> one<00:05:18.860> which<00:05:19.010> wasn't<00:05:19.250> suited

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
and had another one which wasn't suited

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.580 
and had another one which wasn't suited
to<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.820> ground<00:05:20.030> so<00:05:20.300> I'm<00:05:20.840> not<00:05:21.169> convinced<00:05:21.320> about

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
to the ground so I'm not convinced about

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.870
