00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.900
 very important concept a peoples of the 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.400
 discussion 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.219
 much easier from carbon dioxide than from oxygen in the membrane 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.429
 from local pillar 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.579
 they care if it is here 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.039
 going a little bit back when there is severe spasm 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.509
 he sings and docs and Chinese 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.509
 kirch league to the meeting is less 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.689
 i percent also per hundred the inflammation 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.280
 the chronic inflammatory fibrosis processes 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.320
 who also in the capillary membrane 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.019
 he will also do what 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.179
 as much as I am a good amount of oxygen raped her 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.750
 percent to think inside 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.300
 oxygen diffusion are released 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 so in diseases 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 popular cardiopulmonary and better said chronicles 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.930
 affect 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.150
 when they are commenting on their severity 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.019
 to 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.750
 percent to the oxygenation of the blood and therefore the limiting 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990
 the capacity 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 fiscal effort 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.140
 and not so much 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.880
 the excess of carbon dioxide 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 that can give as it has more diffusion is easier 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.320
 its diffusion 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800
 and it's not that singing 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.320
 i the carbon dioxide pretension simple lack of oxygen the lack 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.180
 oxygen what limits 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.860
 the exercise does not get sick 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 pulmonary 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 let's finish in this example 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 little blood from the body is blood 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.649
 for 100 less than for more that it has fallen to arterial blood p 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.850
 actually 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.659
 here is taking the membrane to those of ocoa pilarita refers to the artery 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.520
 pulmonary 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.900
 and in the pulmonary veins 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 remember that the pulmonary artery is based cretin scares 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 to the lungs 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 the venus pulpi the pulmonary veins take arterial blood and sada 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.709
 wing I want from the heart 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:18.669
 but good 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.420
 percent the good is 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.579
 for those who 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.109
 they are not doctors and it tells you arterial blood that you dare not be 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.539
 the blood coming from the body 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.219
 that blood with 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.089
 little oxygen 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:38.139
 and when it comes to the mental the albiol or capillary membrane 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.800
 and the liberal idea has an oxygen pressure 104 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.970
 this pressure difference of 104 40 causes the deceased oxygen capillary and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.229
 the blood that comes out 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.489
 the cartilage 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 pulmonary was going to the tissues of the body 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.919
 cinema 104 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.919
 per 100 millimeters of mercury depression 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.499
 percent e 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.499
 oxygen in the afternoon 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 the blood coming from the body tissues 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.939
 has more carbon dioxide has 45 millimeters of mercury than 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.939
 partial pressure of oxygen carbon 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.629
 py and ll to unveil the air that is in the angels has a pressure 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.079
 partial oxygen in the 40 'then that differentiates you 40 45 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:34.719
 makes this surplus carbon dioxide in venous blood 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.669
 rather, in the blood 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.299
 what comes from the client 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.029
 tissues with little 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:47.739
 with a lot of carbon dioxide that differentiates 45 40 I know what dioxide 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739
 carbon diffuse 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.819
 percent and the blood that take them tissue csi genoa 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.330
 carbon dioxide to be demanded that the difference the street 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
 40 45 in the oxygen carbon pri 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.289
 ibsen previous 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.559
 the previous one 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:15.689
 we saw in oxygen that the difference albiol or capillaries 104 40 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.569
 so there is much more difference 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.549
 to the hair thread 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.809
 what facilitates the diffusion of oxygen 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.960
 my case of carbon dioxide there is much less difference 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.159
 what facilitates but its lamp diffusion power 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.460
 much more than those and secret dinner 'small relative difference 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.289
 this surplus carbon dioxide is known by heart and by albelo 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.039
 zavala the respiratory tract
