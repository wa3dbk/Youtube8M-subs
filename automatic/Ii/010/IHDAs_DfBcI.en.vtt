00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
what's going on those girls they be

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.810 
what's going on those girls they be
doing<00:00:24.080> an<00:00:24.200> unboxing<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.830> overview<00:00:25.010> of<00:00:25.640> this

external<00:00:27.710> hard<00:00:28.160> drive<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.730> got<00:00:29.120> this<00:00:29.210> our<00:00:29.360> job

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
external hard drive I got this our job

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.730 
external hard drive I got this our job
because<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:29.930> am<00:00:30.020> currently<00:00:30.230> running<00:00:30.470> out<00:00:30.710> of

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
because I am currently running out of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.380 
because I am currently running out of
space<00:00:31.010> from<00:00:31.279> all<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.520> videos<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:31.940> make<00:00:32.119> here<00:00:32.300> on

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
space from all the videos I make here on

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.210 
space from all the videos I make here on
YouTube<00:00:32.720> they're<00:00:32.900> on<00:00:33.020> 1080p<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.860> does<00:00:34.010> take

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
YouTube they're on 1080p so it does take

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280 
YouTube they're on 1080p so it does take
quite<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.520> lot<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.760> space<00:00:35.000> up<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.480> I<00:00:35.900> do<00:00:35.960> think

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
quite a lot of space up and I do think

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.840 
quite a lot of space up and I do think
three<00:00:36.440> terabytes<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.280> sweet<00:00:37.550> spot<00:00:37.820> for

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
three terabytes is the sweet spot for

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.780 
three terabytes is the sweet spot for
value<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.750> capacity<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:39.890> all<00:00:40.489> hard<00:00:40.730> drives

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
value and capacity for all hard drives

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.690 
value and capacity for all hard drives
because<00:00:41.540> if<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.320> go<00:00:42.410> up<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.650> say<00:00:42.830> a<00:00:42.860> 4<00:00:43.340> terabyte

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
because if you go up to say a 4 terabyte

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.940 
because if you go up to say a 4 terabyte
hard<00:00:43.820> drive<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.780> does<00:00:44.989> cost<00:00:45.200> quite<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.530> lot<00:00:45.620> more

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
hard drive it does cost quite a lot more

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.979 
hard drive it does cost quite a lot more
and<00:00:46.129> if<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.220> go<00:00:46.400> down<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.970> a<00:00:47.000> 2<00:00:47.450> terabyte<00:00:47.660> hard

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
and if you go down to a 2 terabyte hard

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.960 
and if you go down to a 2 terabyte hard
drive<00:00:48.290> it's<00:00:48.559> really<00:00:48.980> not<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.190> much<00:00:49.370> cheaper

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
drive it's really not that much cheaper

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.610 
drive it's really not that much cheaper
and<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.330> think<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:50.780> Seagate<00:00:51.080> model<00:00:51.320> has<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and I think this Seagate model has the

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.200 
and I think this Seagate model has the
best<00:00:51.830> price<00:00:52.010> performance<00:00:52.160> ratio<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.970> all

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
best price performance ratio of all

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.000 
best price performance ratio of all
external<00:00:53.540> hard<00:00:53.840> drives<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.860> most

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
external hard drives and for the most

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.439 
external hard drives and for the most
up-to-date<00:00:55.220> pricing<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.879> availability<00:00:55.940> for

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
up-to-date pricing and availability for

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.479 
up-to-date pricing and availability for
this<00:00:56.809> drive<00:00:57.080> I've<00:00:57.589> included<00:00:57.920> some<00:00:58.129> links<00:00:58.280> for

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
this drive I've included some links for

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.460 
this drive I've included some links for
you<00:00:58.580> down<00:00:58.879> below<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.330> I<00:00:59.690> usually<00:00:59.839> do<00:01:00.140> reviews

don't<00:01:02.690> know<00:01:02.839> how<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:02.989> should<00:01:03.110> review<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.500> hard

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
don't know how I should review a hard

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.770 
don't know how I should review a hard
drive<00:01:03.949> where<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.519> works<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.059> works<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.690> if

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
drive where if it works it works and if

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.750 
drive where if it works it works and if
it<00:01:05.930> doesn't<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.440> doesn't<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:07.040> also<00:01:07.430> without

boring you with benchmark results that
you<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.310> find<00:01:10.550> off<00:01:10.670> any<00:01:10.850> PC<00:01:11.090> hardware<00:01:11.270> bench

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
you can find off any PC hardware bench

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.390 
you can find off any PC hardware bench
site<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.409> if<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.530> guys<00:01:12.650> once<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.010> review<00:01:13.159> of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
site so if you guys once you review of

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.860 
site so if you guys once you review of
this<00:01:13.520> drive<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:13.970> know<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.120> good<00:01:14.540> interesting

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
this drive and know a good interesting

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.050 
this drive and know a good interesting
way<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.229> should<00:01:15.710> review<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:16.850> let<00:01:17.000> me

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
way I should review this just let me

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.820 
way I should review this just let me
know<00:01:17.120> in<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.390> comments<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.440> initially

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
know in the comments so it initially

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.950 
know in the comments so it initially
comes<00:01:19.070> with<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.580> shrink<00:01:20.060> wrap<00:01:20.270> plastic

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
comes with a shrink wrap plastic

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.149 
comes with a shrink wrap plastic
covering<00:01:21.229> around<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.680> prevent<00:01:21.920> any

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
covering around it to prevent any

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.680 
covering around it to prevent any
moisture<00:01:22.430> during<00:01:22.820> shipping<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.420> we'll<00:01:23.510> just

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
moisture during shipping and we'll just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.420 
moisture during shipping and we'll just
get<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.020> out<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> way<00:01:24.409> before<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:24.770> tore

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
get that out of the way before we tore

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.399 
get that out of the way before we tore
the<00:01:25.460> box<00:01:25.729> because<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.509> creating<00:01:26.930> quite<00:01:27.350> a

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the box because it is creating quite a

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.260 
the box because it is creating quite a
bad<00:01:27.619> reflection<00:01:28.100> off<00:01:28.219> the<00:01:28.250> camera<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.820> once

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
bad reflection off the camera and once

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.459 
bad reflection off the camera and once
that's<00:01:29.450> out<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.780> way<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.200> quick<00:01:30.320> tour

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
that's out of the way for a quick tour

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.779 
that's out of the way for a quick tour
around<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.799> box<00:01:31.009> on<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> front<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.640> have<00:01:31.759> a
