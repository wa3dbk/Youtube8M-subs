00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.980
 yes people what is going on here he is going on and 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.660
 i say , no luck is seen 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.210
 like you with your air 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.680
 you can shoot enlighteners normally 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.599
 could with the thing really only around 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 fly and could such people 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.340
 mark and is actually perfect 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.410
 useless the part also no human you 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.940
 you see outfitter if you ding 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.730
 normal flying around then had 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.160
 player in ipad in hand and could 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.320
 Do not do anything special if you do that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.449
 then you want to do right then you go 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 easily establishes goes to a spot was 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.130
 Weapon is in inventory and before 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.110
 you just wanted to record it 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.989
 short on your keys to the right 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.559
 and stop directly afterwards or iks 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.800
 on the xbox and then he switches to 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.630
 ipad has but if you then go off no 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.759
 ipad in hand but have a weapon 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.649
 and that means you have the glitch 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.380
 done correctly and can then use the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.820
 drone shooting around that's cool 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 whole you can with different weapons 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.250
 do 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.530
 I have this here with a few 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.049
 made with the sniper with the crossbow 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.970
 and in the end what works best 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.189
 in my opinion with the shotgun 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.320
 there could really see real becker 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.090
 the people and definitely makes 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.960
 I really can only recommend that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.900
 try 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.909
