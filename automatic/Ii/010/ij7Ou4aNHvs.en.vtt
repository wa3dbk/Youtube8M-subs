00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.209 

and<00:00:49.960> then<00:00:50.079> like<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.440> can<00:00:50.590> move<00:00:50.710> him<00:00:50.890> left<00:00:51.070> and

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
right in the middle of it to switch like

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.540 
right in the middle of it to switch like
his<00:00:52.989> angles<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:54.390> um<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:56.320> bowling<00:00:56.739> dynamics<00:00:57.399> is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
his angles so um the bowling dynamics is

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.100 
his angles so um the bowling dynamics is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
actually pretty good it's like sometimes

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.979 
actually pretty good it's like sometimes
the<00:00:59.860> pins<00:01:00.129> will<00:01:00.460> do<00:01:00.640> stuff<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.510> pins<00:01:01.780> would

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
the pins will do stuff the pins would

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.330 
the pins will do stuff the pins would
actually<00:01:02.410> do<00:01:02.559> an<00:01:02.800> actual<00:01:03.220> bowling<00:01:03.460> game<00:01:03.760> so

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
but sometimes it's really off sometimes

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:11.969 
but sometimes it's really off sometimes
it's<00:01:10.690> really<00:01:10.840> hard<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.229> control<00:01:11.470> like<00:01:11.710> if<00:01:11.860> you

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
it's really hard to control like if you

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's really hard to control like if you
just<00:01:12.190> like<00:01:12.430> accidentally<00:01:13.060> tilt<00:01:13.509> your<00:01:13.780> mouse

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
like a little to the right oh just like

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770 
like a little to the right oh just like
completely<00:01:17.500> go<00:01:18.340> off<00:01:18.520> course<00:01:18.909> into<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
completely go off course into the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.240 
completely go off course into the
gutters<00:01:20.229> ah<00:01:22.920> nein

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
gutters ah nein

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.960 
gutters ah nein
and<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.869> um<00:01:26.250> every<00:01:27.250> once<00:01:27.429> in<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.580> while<00:01:27.700> some

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
and then um every once in a while some

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120 
and then um every once in a while some
power-ups<00:01:28.420> come<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.080> screen<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:30.009> you

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
power-ups come up on the screen and you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.790 
power-ups come up on the screen and you
have<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.369> try<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:31.450> them<00:01:31.690> but<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.289> find<00:01:32.649> them

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
have to try to get them but I find them

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.770 
have to try to get them but I find them
to<00:01:32.950> be<00:01:32.979> even<00:01:33.310> more<00:01:33.490> confusing<00:01:35.759> okay<00:01:39.660> I've<00:01:40.660> got

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
to be even more confusing okay I've got

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.430 
to be even more confusing okay I've got
it<00:01:40.810> times<00:01:41.110> two<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:43.420> gives<00:01:43.479> me<00:01:43.929> an<00:01:44.080> overall

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
it times two which gives me an overall

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.639 
it times two which gives me an overall
two<00:01:45.160> points<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.509> then<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.750> ogor<00:01:47.050> bonus<00:01:47.440> I

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
two points and then the ogor bonus I

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.130 
two points and then the ogor bonus I
guess<00:01:47.860> those<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.640> helps<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.720> get<00:01:49.899> like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
guess those are what helps you get like

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.880 
guess those are what helps you get like
the<00:01:51.039> extra<00:01:51.460> characters<00:01:51.880> at<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.119> end<00:01:52.890> because

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the extra characters at the end because

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.229 
the extra characters at the end because
they're<00:01:54.039> all<00:01:54.160> pretty<00:01:54.340> much<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.610> same<00:01:54.849> they're

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.239 
they're all pretty much the same they're

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.510 
they're all pretty much the same they're
just<00:01:55.300> they're<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.709> graphics<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.399> the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
just they're the graphics for the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.620 
just they're the graphics for the
characters<00:01:57.970> actually<00:01:58.209> look<00:01:58.539> really<00:01:59.020> bad<00:01:59.459> like

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
characters actually look really bad like

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.510 
characters actually look really bad like
be<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.660> computer<00:02:02.080> I'd<00:02:02.200> expect<00:02:02.739> better<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.340> it's

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
be a computer I'd expect better but it's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.710 
be a computer I'd expect better but it's
just<00:02:03.849> like<00:02:04.080> mmm<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:06.670> Oh<00:02:06.940> what<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.360> heck<00:02:07.569> is

yes

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.330 
yes
each<00:02:17.680> powerup<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:18.310> something<00:02:18.670> different<00:02:19.030> but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
each powerup is something different but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.770 
each powerup is something different but
you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.819> game<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.299> pretty<00:02:22.629> much

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
