will only release when the anchor is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
will only release when the anchor is

box comes with a set of instructions as
well<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> anchor<00:01:12.920> please<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.160> little

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
well as the anchor please take a little

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.840 
well as the anchor please take a little
time<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> read<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.360> familiar<00:01:16.700> look<00:01:17.700> at

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
time to read and get familiar look at

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.080 
time to read and get familiar look at
this<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.180> usually<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> 3/8<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> 1/2<00:01:19.380> intro

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
this we usually use a 3/8 to 1/2 intro

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.399 
this we usually use a 3/8 to 1/2 intro
again<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.299> no<00:01:21.479> chain<00:01:21.780> needed<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
again there's no chain needed with this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.179 
again there's no chain needed with this
anchor<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:23.820> works<00:01:24.060> best<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.479> rope<00:01:24.979> anyway<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
anchor it works best with rope anyway we

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
anchor it works best with rope anyway we
want<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> 5<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> 1<00:01:27.240> slope<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
want to use a 5 to 1 slope and when I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
want to use a 5 to 1 slope and when I
say<00:01:28.439> 5<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> 1<00:01:29.040> slope<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.580> I'm<00:01:29.700> looking<00:01:30.060> at<00:01:30.240> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
say 5 to 1 slope what I'm looking at is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.410 
say 5 to 1 slope what I'm looking at is
the<00:01:30.930> depth<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> water<00:01:31.619> times<00:01:32.430> 5<00:01:32.939> equals

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the depth of the water times 5 equals

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
the depth of the water times 5 equals
the<00:01:34.350> length<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.860> rope<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.340> you'll<00:01:35.580> need<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the length of rope that you'll need to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.170 
the length of rope that you'll need to
be<00:01:36.000> using<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.830> pressure<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> flukes

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
be using the pressure on the flukes

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.249 
be using the pressure on the flukes
especially<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> said<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.049> windy

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
especially like I said in windy

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
especially like I said in windy
conditions<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:41.159> final<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:41.700> Rachael<00:01:42.360> will

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
conditions the final one Rachael will

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
conditions the final one Rachael will
work<00:01:42.810> best<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.340> really

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
work best for you if it's really

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.480 
work best for you if it's really
extremely<00:01:45.030> windy<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.990> suggest<00:01:46.680> maybe<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> 6

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
extremely windy we suggest maybe use a 6

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.590 
extremely windy we suggest maybe use a 6
to<00:01:47.670> 1<00:01:47.820> Rachel<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.610> use<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> chain<00:01:51.180> for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to 1 Rachel you do not use a chain for

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
to 1 Rachel you do not use a chain for
any<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> snap<00:01:52.350> loop<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> anchor

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
any kind of snap loop with this anchor

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
any kind of snap loop with this anchor
maybe<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.150> shackle<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.439> but

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
maybe a shackle if you really want but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.429 
maybe a shackle if you really want but
simply<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> good<00:01:56.880> knot<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> rope<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.960> just

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
simply a good knot in the rope for just

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.039 
simply a good knot in the rope for just
fine<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> the<00:02:00.000> bigger<00:02:00.240> anchor<00:02:00.659> again<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
fine for you the bigger anchor again is

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.480 
fine for you the bigger anchor again is
shown<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.530> we'll<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> little

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
shown here we'll do a little

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.660 
shown here we'll do a little
demonstration<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.540> works<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
demonstration of how it works and as you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
demonstration of how it works and as you
see<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.799> this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> UH<00:02:08.570> eyelet<00:02:09.570> here<00:02:09.810> how

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
see here this is the UH eyelet here how

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.410 
see here this is the UH eyelet here how

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
your rope on the aluminum handle this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
your rope on the aluminum handle this
here<00:02:15.660> will<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:16.370> good<00:02:17.370> mechanism

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
here will be good mechanism
