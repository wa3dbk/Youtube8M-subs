00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
capo so we'll call if the third fret um

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.010 
capo so we'll call if the third fret um
and<00:01:01.730> then<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.880> couple<00:01:02.090> variations<00:01:02.450> of<00:01:02.840> those

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then a couple variations of those

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.920 
and then a couple variations of those
words<00:01:03.500> also<00:01:04.009> an<00:01:04.129> e/m<00:01:04.460> /<00:01:04.850> g<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.479> kind<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.780> like

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
words also an e/m / g it's kind of like

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.239 
words also an e/m / g it's kind of like
an<00:01:06.079> E<00:01:06.170> minor<00:01:06.320> 7<00:01:06.500> um<00:01:08.139> and<00:01:09.139> I<00:01:09.530> think<00:01:09.889> that's

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
an E minor 7 um and I think that's

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.039 
an E minor 7 um and I think that's
pretty<00:01:10.729> much<00:01:10.999> that<00:01:11.240> you're<00:01:11.359> just<00:01:11.569> shifting

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
pretty much that you're just shifting

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.260 
pretty much that you're just shifting

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 

so<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:51.750> break<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.410> down<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> I'll<00:01:52.800> go

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so I'll break that down and I'll go

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840 
so I'll break that down and I'll go
slower<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
slower for you so you can see it so I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.580 
slower for you so you can see it so I
start<00:01:56.850> off<00:01:56.910> with<00:01:57.120> an<00:01:57.330> E<00:01:57.480> minor<00:01:57.720> or<00:01:58.230> it's<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.500> E

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
start off with an E minor or it's an E

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.760 
start off with an E minor or it's an E
minor<00:01:58.740> /g<00:01:59.430> where<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.690> basically<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.470> E<00:02:01.560> minor

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
minor /g where it's basically an E minor

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.100 
minor /g where it's basically an E minor
and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.760> G<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:05.450> you're<00:02:06.450> storming<00:02:06.660> all<00:02:06.840> six

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and then G so you're storming all six

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
and then G so you're storming all six

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
the same place here basically moving

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.170 
the same place here basically moving
this<00:03:35.660> finger<00:03:36.020> just<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.770> one<00:03:37.130> string<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:37.940> D

string okay so that it's the strumming
pattern<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:43.660> see<00:03:44.660> sometimes<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.140> got<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.320> think

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
pattern is see sometimes I got to think

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.650 
pattern is see sometimes I got to think
about<00:03:45.560> in<00:03:45.770> my<00:03:45.860> head<00:03:46.040> so

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:14.970 

so<00:03:54.560> it's<00:04:02.650> see

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.920 

it's<00:04:15.550> funny<00:04:15.790> because<00:04:15.940> because<00:04:16.359> my<00:04:16.510> muscle

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
it's funny because because my muscle

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.960 
it's funny because because my muscle
memory<00:04:16.959> kicks<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.620> i<00:04:17.769> really<00:04:18.040> don't<00:04:18.250> i<00:04:18.489> can't

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
memory kicks in i really don't i can't

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.250 
memory kicks in i really don't i can't
think<00:04:19.090> about<00:04:19.209> how<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.479> play<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.780> song<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> just

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
intro the next part is the the

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.129 
intro the next part is the the
pre-chorus<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.539> sounds<00:04:43.930> something

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
pre-chorus and that sounds something

00:04:44.139 --> 00:05:06.790 
pre-chorus and that sounds something

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.409 

I'm<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.759> break<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.090> down<00:05:08.210> really

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
I'm just going to break it down really

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.730 
I'm just going to break it down really
slow<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:09.819> so<00:05:10.819> cadd9<00:05:11.090> which<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.930> basically<00:05:12.349> make

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
slow so so cadd9 which is basically make

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.820 
slow so so cadd9 which is basically make
a<00:05:12.770> G<00:05:13.039> move<00:05:13.909> these<00:05:14.060> fingers<00:05:14.509> down<00:05:15.259> one<00:05:15.530> string

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
a G move these fingers down one string

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.439 
a G move these fingers down one string
so<00:05:18.159> all<00:05:19.159> right<00:05:19.340> now<00:05:19.849> we<00:05:19.909> go<00:05:20.030> back<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.240> that

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
so all right now we go back to that

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.230 
so all right now we go back to that
variation<00:05:20.900> d<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.979> make<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.520> D<00:05:22.759> and<00:05:22.789> have<00:05:23.090> your

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
variation d so make a D and have your

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.869 
variation d so make a D and have your
pinky<00:05:23.539> on<00:05:23.659> there<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:26.120> now<00:05:26.270> it's<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.629> minor<00:05:26.840> /<00:05:27.110> g
