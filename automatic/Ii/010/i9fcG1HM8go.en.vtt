his phone

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.859 
his phone
so<00:01:29.289> I<00:01:29.350> put<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.680> number<00:01:29.979> I<00:01:30.880> didn't<00:01:31.659> know<00:01:31.719> what

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
so I put the number I didn't know what

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:32.999 
so I put the number I didn't know what
else<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.049> put<00:01:32.259> there<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.469> I<00:01:32.530> wanted<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.799> put

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
else to put there and I wanted to put

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.630 
else to put there and I wanted to put
something<00:01:33.399> there<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.630> yeah<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.100> then<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.579> got

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
something there so yeah and then I got

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.510 
something there so yeah and then I got
the<00:01:36.850> little<00:01:37.000> window<00:01:37.899> effect<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:39.219> kind<00:01:39.430> of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
the little window effect it's kind of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.340 
the little window effect it's kind of
pointless<00:01:39.789> I<00:01:40.240> mean<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.539> guess<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.930> kind<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.170> adds

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
pointless I mean I guess it kind of adds

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.219 
pointless I mean I guess it kind of adds
to<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.740> ambience<00:01:41.859> but<00:01:42.280> yeah<00:01:42.969> I<00:01:43.509> probably

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
to the ambience but yeah I probably

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.200 
to the ambience but yeah I probably
could<00:01:44.409> have<00:01:44.469> done<00:01:44.560> without<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:46.030> wasn't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
could have done without it it wasn't

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.919 
could have done without it it wasn't
really<00:01:46.479> necessary<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:48.689> yeah

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
really necessary and yeah

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.760 
really necessary and yeah
farting<00:01:50.469> on<00:01:50.590> his<00:01:50.799> phone<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:53.320> kind<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.590> hard

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
farting on his phone it's kind of hard

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.499 
farting on his phone it's kind of hard
to<00:01:53.799> see<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:54.159> oh<00:01:54.399> whatever

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
to see but oh whatever

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.749 
to see but oh whatever
that's<00:01:56.350> that's<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.369> thing<00:01:57.399> with<00:01:57.640> my

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
that's that's the thing with my

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.999 
that's that's the thing with my
animations<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.450> sometimes<00:01:59.079> put<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.619> hard<00:01:59.859> to

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
animations I sometimes put it hard to

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
faces lately and in a future animation

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.020

bit like this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.119 
bit like this
I<00:02:19.819> don't<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.840> why<00:02:20.989> I'm<00:02:21.319> drawing<00:02:21.739> them<00:02:21.890> like

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
I don't know why I'm drawing them like

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.500 
I don't know why I'm drawing them like
that<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:23.330> just<00:02:23.510> fun<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.920> kind<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.190> fun<00:02:25.510> but

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
that it's just fun it's kind of fun but

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.119 
that it's just fun it's kind of fun but
they<00:02:26.690> kind<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> gross<00:02:27.470> me<00:02:27.650> out<00:02:27.680> at<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> same

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129

time<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:30.790> his<00:02:31.790> mouth<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:33.250> guess<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.519> kind<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
time to his mouth I guess it was kind of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.370 
time to his mouth I guess it was kind of
weird<00:02:34.970> animating<00:02:35.540> his<00:02:35.660> mouth<00:02:35.870> because<00:02:36.050> it's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
weird animating his mouth because it's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.509 
weird animating his mouth because it's
just<00:02:36.530> kind<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.739> like<00:02:36.800> he's<00:02:37.160> kind<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.430> like
