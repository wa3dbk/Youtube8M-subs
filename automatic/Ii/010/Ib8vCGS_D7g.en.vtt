okay<00:00:01.410> hello<00:00:01.800> welcome<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.850> star<00:00:03.090> tutorial

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
okay hello welcome to the star tutorial

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.240 
okay hello welcome to the star tutorial
and<00:00:05.180> so<00:00:06.180> first<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.290> need<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.710> strip<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> paper

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
and so first you need a strip of paper

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.549 
and so first you need a strip of paper
this<00:00:09.030> happens<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.050> my<00:00:10.200> washy

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this happens to be one of my washy

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.680 
this happens to be one of my washy
papers<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.660> 18<00:00:13.790> centimeters<00:00:14.790> by<00:00:15.210> 1

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
papers and it is 18 centimeters by 1

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.080 
papers and it is 18 centimeters by 1
centimeter<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.449> thicker<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.930> want<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:20.090> this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
centimeter the thicker you want it this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.109 
centimeter the thicker you want it this
way<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:22.350> longer<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> strip<00:00:23.490> will<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.970> be

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
way the longer the strip will have to be

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.220 
way the longer the strip will have to be
so<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.650> depends<00:00:26.990> also<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.080> you're

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
so it just depends also if you're

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
so it just depends also if you're
planning<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> small<00:00:29.130> star<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.880> cut

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
planning to make a small star don't cut

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
planning to make a small star don't cut
it<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.599> long<00:00:30.900> or<00:00:31.230> else<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.070> star<00:00:32.279> will

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it too long or else you're the star will

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
it too long or else you're the star will
be<00:00:32.460> too<00:00:32.640> thick<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.030> it'll<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.270> hard<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> puff

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
be too thick and it'll be hard to puff

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.760 
be too thick and it'll be hard to puff
it<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.969> well<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.600> anyway<00:00:36.770> if

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it and well not like that but anyway if

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
it and well not like that but anyway if
you<00:00:38.309> make<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> too<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:40.230> thick

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you make it too if you make it too thick

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
you make it too if you make it too thick
but<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.309> long<00:00:41.520> enough<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.030> won't<00:00:42.149> have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but not long enough you won't have

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.750 
but not long enough you won't have
enough<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> star<00:00:43.260> okay<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
enough to make a star okay so what you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.200 
enough to make a star okay so what you
do<00:00:44.910> first<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.230> end<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
do first is you take one end of it

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.700 
do first is you take one end of it
this<00:00:48.210> end<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> side<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this end is pretty here on that side so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
this end is pretty here on that side so
I'll<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> end<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.780> make<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.110> loop<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I'll do this end and you make a loop it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
I'll do this end and you make a loop it
kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> looks<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> those

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
kind of looks like you know one of those

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.189 
kind of looks like you know one of those
breast-cancer<00:00:55.559> loops<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.760> take<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.960> long

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
breast-cancer loops you take the long

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.639 
breast-cancer loops you take the long
end<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> through<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.469> loop<00:01:01.620> like

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
end and you put it through the loop like

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.539 
end and you put it through the loop like
this<00:01:02.149> okay<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.660> pull<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.549> now

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this okay and you pull it through now

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
this okay and you pull it through now
you<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.850> sort<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> knot<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you have sort of like a knot here and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
you have sort of like a knot here and
you<00:01:07.740> tighten<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> knot<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.150> pulling<00:01:09.479> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you tighten the knot just by pulling on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.250 
you tighten the knot just by pulling on
the<00:01:10.619> two<00:01:10.830> ends<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.310> tightening<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the two ends and tightening it like that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.920 
the two ends and tightening it like that
and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> flatten<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.509> see<00:01:15.509> it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then you flatten it see it's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.890 
and then you flatten it see it's
flattened<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> little

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
flattened and you have this little

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
flattened and you have this little
Pentagon<00:01:18.900> shape<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.979> shape<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
Pentagon shape the shape of a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
Pentagon shape the shape of a
five-pointed<00:01:20.970> star<00:01:21.570> almost<00:01:21.900> yet<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.350> yet<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
five-pointed star almost yet not yet but

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
five-pointed star almost yet not yet but
you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:23.009> almost<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> take

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you know almost there and then you take

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.429 
you know almost there and then you take
the<00:01:24.990> long<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.520> fold<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> over<00:01:27.439> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the long side and you fold it over to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
the long side and you fold it over to
the<00:01:28.590> side<00:01:28.829> where<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> small<00:01:29.820> little

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the side where you see the small little

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.160 
the side where you see the small little
strip<00:01:30.390> hanging<00:01:31.280> okay<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:33.960> there

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
strip hanging okay and then from there

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.940 
strip hanging okay and then from there
you<00:01:34.590> fold<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> again<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> angle<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you fold it again and the angle of the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.490 
you fold it again and the angle of the
sides<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.150> sort<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> guide<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.290> as

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sides will you know sort of guide you as

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
sides will you know sort of guide you as
to<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> next<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to which side to go to next and you just

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.990 
to which side to go to next and you just
I<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> guys<00:01:44.369> saw<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.759> part

okay and then you just keep going around

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.850 
okay and then you just keep going around
see<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.960> keep<00:01:55.820> folding<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.149> paper

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
see that just keep folding the paper

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.920 
see that just keep folding the paper
around<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.250> around<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.700> around<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.810> in

around and around and around and then in
the<00:02:01.049> end<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.320> gonna<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.210> small<00:02:03.210> strip

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the end you're gonna get a small strip

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.920 
the end you're gonna get a small strip
left<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> end<00:02:04.680> right<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.659> what<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.689> do
