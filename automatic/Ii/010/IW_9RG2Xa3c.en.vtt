grits known and today I'm going to tell

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.140 
grits known and today I'm going to tell
you<00:00:10.559> how<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.039> calculate<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.670> many<00:00:11.730> kills<00:00:12.059> you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you how to calculate how many kills you

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.560 
you how to calculate how many kills you
need<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.539> black<00:00:13.110> ops<00:00:13.260> 2<00:00:13.350> zombies<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:14.039> run<00:00:14.250> cop

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
need in black ops 2 zombies to run cop

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.679 
need in black ops 2 zombies to run cop
it<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.809> let<00:00:15.930> us<00:00:15.959> begin<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> there's<00:00:18.060> our<00:00:18.180> simple

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
it so let us begin so there's our simple

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.929 
it so let us begin so there's our simple
formula<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.289> doing<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.820> your

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
formula for doing this you have your

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.120 
formula for doing this you have your
total<00:00:21.269> downs<00:00:21.449> multiply<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.349> your<00:00:22.500> KD<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
total downs multiply where your KD that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.429 
total downs multiply where your KD that
you<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.630> want<00:00:24.839> to<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.140> goal

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you want so if you want to get this goal

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.970 
you want so if you want to get this goal
with<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.039> knife<00:00:26.250> that's<00:00:26.939> 50<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.650> want<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
with the knife that's 50 if you want to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
with the knife that's 50 if you want to
get<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> shotgun<00:00:29.460> set<00:00:29.880> 150<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:31.080> gives<00:00:31.289> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
get the shotgun set 150 that gives you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.680 
get the shotgun set 150 that gives you
the<00:00:31.529> total<00:00:31.710> kills<00:00:32.070> required<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.420> refer

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the total kills required and you refer

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
the total kills required and you refer
those<00:00:33.870> total<00:00:34.290> kills<00:00:34.470> require<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.100> subtract

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
those total kills require you subtract

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.740 
those total kills require you subtract
the<00:00:35.490> total<00:00:35.700> kills<00:00:36.060> that<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.300> already<00:00:36.450> have

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the total kills that you already have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
the total kills that you already have
and<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.200> tells<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.560> how<00:00:37.590> many<00:00:37.920> kills<00:00:38.160> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and that tells you how many kills you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
and that tells you how many kills you
need<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.670> rank<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.720> is<00:00:39.900> if<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.470> fall<00:00:40.680> going

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
need to rank up that is if we fall going

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.870 
need to rank up that is if we fall going
down<00:00:41.160> once<00:00:43.010> now<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.250> every<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.580> you<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.850> down

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
down once now for every time you go down

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.360 
down once now for every time you go down
you<00:00:45.450> had<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> add<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.650> number<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you had need to add the number for the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
you had need to add the number for the
KD<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.970> you<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.630> total<00:00:48.810> killing

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
KD that you want it to the total killing

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.240 
KD that you want it to the total killing
get<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.920> rank<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:51.350> let's<00:00:52.350> look<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.800> good

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
get to rank up let's look in a good

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.490 
get to rank up let's look in a good
example<00:00:53.700> of<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.240> you<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.570> 250<00:00:55.290> downs

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
example of this so you have 250 downs

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.370 
example of this so you have 250 downs
and<00:00:56.240> 35,000<00:00:57.240> kills<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.200> get<00:00:58.290> to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
and 35,000 kills and you want to get to

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.530 
and 35,000 kills and you want to get to
the<00:00:58.470> sugar<00:00:58.680> rack<00:00:58.920> how<00:00:59.520> many<00:00:59.730> kills<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
the sugar rack how many kills do you

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.290 
the sugar rack how many kills do you
need<00:01:00.740> okay<00:01:01.740> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> grab<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> 250<00:01:03.090> times

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
need okay so you grab the 250 times

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
need okay so you grab the 250 times
multiplied<00:01:03.900> that<00:01:04.049> rather<00:01:04.259> than<00:01:04.320> 150<00:01:04.860> kg<00:01:05.040> which

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
multiplied that rather than 150 kg which

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.620 
multiplied that rather than 150 kg which
is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> key<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.980> shopkins

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
is the key you need to get the shopkins

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.790 
is the key you need to get the shopkins
there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> picture<00:01:09.990> over<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.320> telling<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
there's a picture over there telling you

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.190 
there's a picture over there telling you
from<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> previous<00:01:11.250> video<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.510> kds<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.050> need

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
from my previous video which kds we need

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
from my previous video which kds we need
for<00:01:13.410> each<00:01:13.560> rank<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.970> gives<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> thirty

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
for each rank so that gives you thirty

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
for each rank so that gives you thirty
seven<00:01:15.720> thousand<00:01:16.110> five<00:01:16.260> hundred<00:01:16.290> kills<00:01:16.680> then

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
seven thousand five hundred kills then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.050 
seven thousand five hundred kills then
from<00:01:17.730> those<00:01:17.850> 37,500<00:01:18.690> kills<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> subtract<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
from those 37,500 kills you subtract the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.190 
from those 37,500 kills you subtract the
35,000<00:01:21.060> kills<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> gives<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> two

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
35,000 kills and it gives you two

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
35,000 kills and it gives you two
thousand<00:01:22.590> five<00:01:22.680> hundred<00:01:22.770> kills<00:01:23.130> needed<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
thousand five hundred kills needed to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.600 
thousand five hundred kills needed to
get<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> shotgun<00:01:24.060> wreck<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.620> that<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
get the shotgun wreck so that is that is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.740 
get the shotgun wreck so that is that is
the<00:01:26.760> kills<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> need<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.510> get<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the kills that you need to get that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
the kills that you need to get that
chirping<00:01:28.050> right<00:01:28.460> okay<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:30.240> does<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.570> change

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
chirping right okay how does this change

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.010 
chirping right okay how does this change
if<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.570> previous<00:01:33.750> example

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
if you go down in our previous example

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
if you go down in our previous example
every<00:01:34.500> time<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.860> down<00:01:35.070> trying<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.550> get<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
every time we go down trying to get the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
every time we go down trying to get the
2500<00:01:36.780> kills<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.050> have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> add<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.440> hundred<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
2500 kills you have to add a hundred and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
2500 kills you have to add a hundred and
fifty<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.490> total<00:01:39.300> kills<00:01:39.510> needed<00:01:39.870> because

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
fifty two total kills needed because

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
fifty two total kills needed because
that<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.610> average<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.690> need<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that is the average that you need the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.980 
that is the average that you need the
150<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.310> need<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.600> shopkins

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
150 is what you need to get the shopkins

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.420 
150 is what you need to get the shopkins
so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.400> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so you have to like that if it was a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.820 
so you have to like that if it was a
knife<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.180> our<00:01:48.210> 50<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.870> it<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.500> known<00:01:49.740> as

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
knife you into our 50 if it was known as

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.910 
knife you into our 50 if it was known as
for<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.490> add<00:01:50.580> 30<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:52.080> all

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
for you to add 30 and so on all

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
for you to add 30 and so on all
depending<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.940> previous<00:01:54.270> numbers<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
depending from the previous numbers that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.399 
depending from the previous numbers that
we<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.479> example<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we have here so for example say that the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
we have here so for example say that the
next<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.100> 500<00:01:59.580> kills<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.180> go

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
next time you get 500 kills and you go

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
next time you get 500 kills and you go
down<00:02:00.330> twice<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> following

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
down twice you need to do the following

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
down twice you need to do the following
you<00:02:02.760> got<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.229> 2500<00:02:04.229> kill<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> need<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.010> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you got to 2500 kill so you need it you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
you got to 2500 kill so you need it you
should<00:02:05.460> try<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> 500<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.450> got<00:02:06.600> okay<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
should try to 500 that you got okay so

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
should try to 500 that you got okay so
you<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.560> two<00:02:07.770> thousand<00:02:08.129> left<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.849> no<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you have two thousand left but no you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
you have two thousand left but no you
have<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> add<00:02:09.899> 250<00:02:10.590> times<00:02:10.829> two<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.249> you

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
have to add 250 times two because you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.890 
have to add 250 times two because you
went<00:02:11.639> down<00:02:11.730> two<00:02:11.939> times

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
went down two times

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.039 
went down two times
and<00:02:13.019> at<00:02:13.260> 150<00:02:13.920> kills<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.970> need<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.870> each

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
and at 150 kills that you need for each

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.990 
and at 150 kills that you need for each
of<00:02:16.500> those<00:02:16.650> downs<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> need<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.670> add<00:02:17.849> those

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
of those downs so you need to add those

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240 
of those downs so you need to add those
two<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> need<00:02:18.599> 2,300<00:02:19.260> kills<00:02:19.439> for<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:19.980> next

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
two so you need 2,300 kills for the next

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.369 
two so you need 2,300 kills for the next
friend<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.629> basically<00:02:21.780> how<00:02:22.260> you

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
friend and that is basically how you

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.869 
friend and that is basically how you
calculate<00:02:22.680> how<00:02:23.099> many<00:02:23.189> kills<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.640> need<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
calculate how many kills you need to

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.670
