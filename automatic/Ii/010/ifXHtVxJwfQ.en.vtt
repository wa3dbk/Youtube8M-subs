00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.459
 Do you know that 

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.980
 Percent who looks like a Lohse drummed on but what Lausanne 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.630
 Those are and rivets and winners are loyal to the Greens who are the winners of the lots 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.390
 red the lousy offer are all questions Océ 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.390
 the reds are totally outrageous to the council and the greens are percent 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.350
 harmless Met percent who want to congratulate themselves a bit 14 this 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.890
 FC Basel III want the harmful effect than conventional trucks is after 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.880
 In fact, a corner also fell reactor 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.290
 Since the start of construction of the construction process ago I start I 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.560
 while percent 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 Look what the question 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 they would have expected that the wanker is so successful 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.089
 m No, I did not think the change would be so successful 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.860
 the Victor he was really a tough fight 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 before that, I thought he thought the rating would be successful 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700
 then I had thought that will be a giant flop 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.520
 because there was a lot different it was as I thought and I understand a lot 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.750
 I have learned what you can not do and so 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
 that he was so successful 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 she did not think she was really happy 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 mainly because of the expected second movie here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 in our opinion has become much more beautiful 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.160
 however, it is far from being as successful as the first one 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.360
 have to do whose third will be nice and successful then 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.040
 Parts of the as with them they sometimes even in the entrance to the VGH not at all 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.410
 but also knew about it satire about something people make me laugh 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.110
 know board too but that's important to me that you just this world new 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 creates and somehow in there percent brings something completely new that too 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.649
 Andre got it 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.560
 and that's what we have now so at the latest by the second really 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.810
 solidified and Esslingen am Neckar at least on to continue 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.670
 and about ca is then great and successful, we are curious why 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 Produce something challenging for the German 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.990
 Watching TV is just criticizing 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.210
 I do that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 it's always that I produce as in life he has the most stupid 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 play is not with me but I work like a crazy and then what 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.310
 Things are done 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.680
 but maybe we all thought Torriecher literature and our own ideas 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.940
 could the magazine but the salary the substantial does not interest me at all 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.489
 so i see i'm more of a friend of well-made light entertainment so i 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.949
 let me in 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.279
 Percent foreign worlds or kidnap somewhere where I want Merkel 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.329
 that is well done and intelligent entertainment even if it is not now 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.819
 some literary or otherwise in the cultural education program saying 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.609
 i loved let me follow from Altena Enterprise or from file x 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.739
 as well as the Simpsons UL maintain as well as percent one 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.930
 a literary adaptation or whatever because I think it has everything 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.099
 The main thing it serves is consistent and well done 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.019
 that's the way it is and that's why it's the same about others over Samel too 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.110
 what Matt disc or such an opponent I would like to do more 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.099
 not on me percent motto I always have to look where my place is free 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.009
 with the many great program which gives 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.279
 three hours later, he was the youngest to have run six full-length targets 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.399
 but the Bravo is serious 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.460
 when did they realize that they are funny? 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.210
 I've noticed that people have always somehow turned people into people 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.000
 Percent voluntarily or involuntarily could bring laugh and that was so 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.109
 me at school 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.899
 to be bilges noted Loki dyke not athletic Binder is a small one 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.829
 fat students are mediocre 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.280
 um, and now somehow not by the towering performance 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.110
 and also not outstanding coolness the people somehow percent possible on the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.249
 my site can sometimes make you laugh 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.149
 then I try that a bit in the direction 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.559
 so before you see man almond you can control yourself why the people 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:32.799
 about a laugh 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.259
 like trying to be heart and soul and they laugh about it 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.569
 as a child-hater, evil storytellers and Lotte have them 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.219
 many fans Pfiffen and Lotta were stuck 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.809
 «It never stands a lot of him this Petz 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.749
 in this too 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.409
 somehow everything still seems to be in there, everything does not matter despite going on stage 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.749
 And that's what I think, that I'm in every one of them 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.420
 but you must never identify 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.400
 and the stick so much in me and my mother always has girls 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.369
 written 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.609
 and I had to correct that and I studied German and 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.070
 German Studies he has me 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.759
 it saves on the German language messed up 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.689
 because I did not have a real pleasure and I thought so now 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.999
 I have to defend myself I write fairy tales that are different and not 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.809
 destroy the German language 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:21.599
 and that both together can be the system that people have found 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.360
 around which I have to say that I have been testing so long ago 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.309
 Cardio story 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:31.019
 This led to him becoming calmer but somewhere he still does not live 

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.369
 in me and now and then comes out as always short on the stage they forced 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:37.689
 had to live it out and have austrias got it all 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.110
 Fun and percent 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.539
 I think that was very very important because I worked up a lot of clearance sales 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.699
 Always said then I would be the comedy they are too 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.009
 Unger and more relaxed and relaxed every time more because I have this 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.599
 The goal of this feeling of being a citizen I belong to now I can get upset in mine 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.180
 Let work out other people have to be friendly at work 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.050
 and then somehow have to see at home how to get rid of the frustration. "Me 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.159
 Las the footballer unemployed can then 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.159
 If Steiner is good at running well at home again, be peaceful 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.099
 thanks for portable devices
