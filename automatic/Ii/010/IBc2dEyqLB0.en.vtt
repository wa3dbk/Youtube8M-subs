00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
landscape there's a there's an enormous

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.149 
landscape there's a there's an enormous
amount<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.270> reasons<00:01:47.659> not<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.929> do<00:01:48.259> what<00:01:48.979> I<00:01:49.009> do

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
amount of reasons not to do what I do

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.580 
amount of reasons not to do what I do
but<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.939> is<00:01:50.119> go<00:01:50.329> out<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.539> paint<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.020> location

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
but that is go out and paint a location

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.370 
but that is go out and paint a location
with<00:01:52.099> the<00:01:52.130> world<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.549> there's<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.060> lot<00:01:53.179> of

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
with the world a there's a lot of

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.839 
with the world a there's a lot of
enormous<00:01:54.380> amount<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.799> reasons<00:01:55.159> not<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.579> do

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
enormous amount of reasons not to do

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.630 
enormous amount of reasons not to do
that<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.829> there's<00:01:57.829> just<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.129> couple<00:01:58.280> reasons

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
that but there's just a couple reasons

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.539 
that but there's just a couple reasons
why<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.719> would<00:01:59.869> want<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.979> they<00:02:01.520> are

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
why you would want to and they are

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.520 
why you would want to and they are
compelling<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.599> that's<00:02:02.750> what<00:02:02.959> drives<00:02:03.259> me<00:02:03.439> to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
compelling and that's what drives me to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.539 
compelling and that's what drives me to
do<00:02:03.799> these<00:02:03.950> things<00:02:04.189> there<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:04.939> no<00:02:05.060> way<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.420> get<00:02:05.750> a

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
do these things there is no way to get a

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.190 
do these things there is no way to get a
sense<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.909> place<00:02:08.690> or<00:02:09.019> time<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:11.420> or<00:02:11.690> with<00:02:12.079> an

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
sense of place or time in or with an

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.240 
sense of place or time in or with an
artificial<00:02:12.560> needs<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> photograph

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
artificial needs like a photograph

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.289 
artificial needs like a photograph
there's<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.549> just<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> same

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
there's it's just not the same

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.360 
there's it's just not the same
experience<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:17.959> think<00:02:18.170> about<00:02:18.319> art<00:02:18.560> recording

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
experience you think about art recording

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.780 
experience you think about art recording
and<00:02:19.549> experience<00:02:21.099> with<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.129> photograph<00:02:22.579> it's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and experience with a photograph it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.980 
and experience with a photograph it's
already<00:02:23.120> filtered<00:02:23.359> once<00:02:23.780> removed

with memory it's a kind of something of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.890 
with memory it's a kind of something of
a<00:02:31.620> secondhand<00:02:32.160> experience<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a secondhand experience it's not the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.930 
a secondhand experience it's not the
rawness<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.650> rugged<00:02:34.860> aesthetic<00:02:35.730> that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
rawness and the rugged aesthetic that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.370 
rawness and the rugged aesthetic that
you<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.240> experience<00:02:36.710> out<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.460> actual

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you would experience out in the actual

you would experience out in the actual
situation<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.070> also<00:02:41.640> here's<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.210> big

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
situation and also here's the big

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.620 
situation and also here's the big
problem<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.440> painting<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.950> studio<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> that

problem with painting in studio and that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.220 
problem with painting in studio and that
is<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:47.100> force<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.610> nature<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.330> compelling

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
is the force of nature is not compelling

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.870 
is the force of nature is not compelling
or<00:02:49.800> driving<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.360> make<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.440> works<00:02:55.880> as

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
quickly and with these same dynamic

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200 
quickly and with these same dynamic
qualities<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.540> would<00:03:00.690> nor<00:03:01.140> nearly<00:03:01.560> have
