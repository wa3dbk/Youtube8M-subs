really easily which I don't like at all

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.830 
really easily which I don't like at all
because<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:29.130> other<00:02:29.250> foundations<00:02:29.880> don't<00:02:30.330> come

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
because my other foundations don't come

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.140

off<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.650> all<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.940> one

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
off like that at all but on this one

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
off like that at all but on this one
just<00:02:33.360> collides<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.290> pretty<00:02:34.650> easily<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.190> you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
just collides all pretty easily so you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.000 
just collides all pretty easily so you
have<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.820> set<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.030> foundation<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.050> another

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
have to set with foundation and another

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.150 
have to set with foundation and another
thing<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.610> um<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.870> stays<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.740> about<00:02:40.890> like

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
thing is um it stays on for about like

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.490 
thing is um it stays on for about like
five<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.790> six<00:02:42.000> hours<00:02:42.120> before<00:02:42.420> kind<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.170> fades

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
five to six hours before kind of fades

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.850 
five to six hours before kind of fades

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a sample size or something because this

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.000 
a sample size or something because this
is<00:03:33.989> definitely<00:03:34.380> worth<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.709> i<00:03:34.799> know<00:03:34.890> it's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
is definitely worth it i know it's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.509 
is definitely worth it i know it's
expensive<00:03:35.220> but<00:03:35.780> there's<00:03:36.780> about<00:03:37.040> 1.1<00:03:38.040> 8<00:03:38.280> fluid

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
expensive but there's about 1.1 8 fluid

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.910 
expensive but there's about 1.1 8 fluid
ounces<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.080> i<00:03:40.140> mean<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.680> little

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
ounces in here so i mean in a little

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.620 
ounces in here so i mean in a little
goes<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.070> long<00:03:41.160> way<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.549> i<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.510> is
