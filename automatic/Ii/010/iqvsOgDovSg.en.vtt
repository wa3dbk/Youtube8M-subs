 sima statute from new year holidays from 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 breaking tables is natural to eat 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.619
 I don't really want to cook but today I 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 when you have no time or when you 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 too lazy to cook and you need very quickly 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.050
