should<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.220> real<00:00:23.369> easy<00:00:23.570> I've<00:00:24.570> never<00:00:24.750> actually

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
should be real easy I've never actually

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
should be real easy I've never actually
done<00:00:25.080> before<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.590> honestly<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:27.449> kind<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
done before and honestly it's kind of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
done before and honestly it's kind of
freaking<00:00:27.930> me<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> let's<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

I<00:00:32.099> had<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.030> car<00:00:33.239> modified<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.410> easily

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
I had this car modified so I can easily

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.270 
I had this car modified so I can easily
just<00:00:34.680> wipe<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.840> half<00:00:36.840> double<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:38.040> point

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
just wipe out half double a three point

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.229 
just wipe out half double a three point
six<00:00:38.430> volt<00:00:38.700> battery

I<00:00:39.410> got<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> battery<00:00:40.680> without<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> leaves

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
I got a battery without the leaves

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150 
I got a battery without the leaves
because<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.940> put<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.480> removable<00:00:43.230> week<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
because they put in a removable week so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.090 
because they put in a removable week so
in<00:00:44.520> theory<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.170> able<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.590> leave<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
in theory I just be able to leave this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.750 
in theory I just be able to leave this
motherboard<00:00:47.670> powered<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:49.489> remove<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> old

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
and turn off the power it should work

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.369 
and turn off the power it should work
like<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.510> said<00:01:00.719> I've<00:01:00.809> never<00:01:00.870> done<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.199> before

will<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> decryption<00:01:24.119> part<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.560> have

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
will up the decryption part has to have

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.510 
will up the decryption part has to have
a<00:01:25.770> battery<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.490> operate<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.280> only<00:01:29.400> way<00:01:29.490> to

a battery to operate and the only way to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.010 
a battery to operate and the only way to
replace<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> either<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> essentially<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
replace it is either in essentially a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560 
replace it is either in essentially a
slave<00:01:31.290> battery<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:32.130> doing<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.180> powered

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
slave battery or doing it well powered

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.770 
slave battery or doing it well powered
on<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:35.310> should<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.520> simple<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.390> should<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.600> real

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
on it should be simple it should be real

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.700 
on it should be simple it should be real
simple<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.869> what<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.170> parts

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
simple with this what the way this parts

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
cart that's the battery what I'm going

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
cart that's the battery what I'm going
to<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.519> take<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> little<00:02:41.910> Tweaker<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.660> just

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
to do is take a little Tweaker and just

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.759 
to do is take a little Tweaker and just
carefully<00:02:43.709> pry<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.310> pop<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.730> battery<00:02:45.150> out

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
hopefully by prying it I won't crack the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.259 
hopefully by prying it I won't crack the
solder<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.430> cracked<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
solder on this because I cracked the
