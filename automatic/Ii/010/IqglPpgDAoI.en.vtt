00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
caliber of entertainment than that and I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.710 
caliber of entertainment than that and I

think there's a few childish people

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.090 
think there's a few childish people
childish<00:03:46.230> minds<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.740> childish

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
childish minds and childish

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.530 
childish minds and childish
personalities<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.730> think<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.120> money

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
personalities that think that money

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.300 
personalities that think that money
being<00:03:48.870> brought<00:03:49.170> into<00:03:49.410> competitive<00:03:49.890> gaming

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
being brought into competitive gaming

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.980 
being brought into competitive gaming
and<00:03:50.550> gaming<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.000> general<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> bad<00:03:51.960> thing

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
and gaming in general is a bad thing

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.040 
and gaming in general is a bad thing
whereas<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.100> would<00:03:53.310> say<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:54.330> exact<00:03:54.570> opposite<00:03:54.960> i

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
whereas I would say the exact opposite i

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.480 
whereas I would say the exact opposite i
think<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> more<00:03:55.560> money<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:55.920> gets<00:03:56.190> involved

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
think the more money that gets involved

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.770 
think the more money that gets involved
with<00:03:56.670> gaming<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.240> better<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.660> more
