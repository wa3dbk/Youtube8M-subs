tour and how she was used to it breaking
down<00:07:34.370> and<00:07:34.580> changing<00:07:34.970> so<00:07:35.180> it's<00:07:36.170> just<00:07:36.290> the

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
down and changing so it's just the

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.660 
down and changing so it's just the
rookie<00:07:36.590> season<00:07:37.040> and<00:07:37.130> she's<00:07:37.280> hoping<00:07:37.610> to
