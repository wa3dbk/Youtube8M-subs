00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.199
 hello and if françois rose bushes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.449
 lozeau workshops I am still a country of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 geneviève today and we will 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.680
 do a little station portrait in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.939
 studio but that we flash the studio 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.050
 because we oppose them 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 so we'll see what can we 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 simply do with the camera and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.949
 maybe also with the built-in flash 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
 so we just start with our 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 ambient light camera so beautiful 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 studio light let's see what that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.930
 give us and I'll have it anyway 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 some basic adjustments finally 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 mainly at the beginning having to choose 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.980
 the iso here i am at 100 iso 125 years old on 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 go see what does it give me I 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.420
 the goal will be 10,202 points 8 I 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520
 believe that I would really have to work at 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.629
 full opening 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.280
 we start with a white balance 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.539
 automatic to the king what is it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.539
 just give up and I like 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 no it tomorrow I'm working on a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 tripod because I think I 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.170
 Rework in speed not bad base not 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.439
 wrong base 1 8th 10th of a second so I 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 come will not move for sure and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.810
 I have a nice picture a little bit 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.479
 delicate hand 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.509
 barely move but it's still 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.869
 well but we're marking a sixth of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.380
 second it's really not the ideal 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.210
 what can i do for 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.090
 improve it but already I could 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.750
 increase the sensitivity I changed my 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.960
 iso with a 17000 I can easily get me 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.860
 makes up to 800 iso which I look at this 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.710
 1800 iso 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.060
 always in manual mode so so 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.810
 that when I'm having my maid 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 exposure 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.140
 i will be sure geneviève we have 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.750
 all subsequent exposures a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.580
 exchange report of which is lived like that 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.259
 and their challenge still a lot of 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.739
 speed then 1 80th 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.260
 it's going to be good and as I 'm becoming 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.700
 in the medium tonalities these clothes 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.030
 some elite and paul is still 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 enough to lose a gray card I was at 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.890
 1.80 2.8 for 800 iso 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.510
 it's still interesting 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.650
 a few people are missing 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.900
 in and I could surely 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.200
 the argan tree by putting a little bit of 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.140
 flash 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.390
 we will see what it gives with my 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.070
 flash but we remember that I have everything 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.260
 time says that plus my source of 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.239
 light is great more light is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 sweet when in a light source that 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.200
 is really small I do not know 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.340
 what does that give you over 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.109
 that we really flash the problem 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.900
 raised by these two risks and having 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.799
 red eyes 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.930
 geneviève has green eyes, so 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.790
 maybe a little less danger and I have 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.150
 anyway kind is born on camera here 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.950
 that beautiful blue eyes face 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.480
 moroccans soap them to see them if I 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:09.489
 the small picture of him with the farm 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:11.230
 flash since I'm going to use the flash 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.489
 I'm going to be able to ben it's moïse or to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.280
 to go down to 100 iso 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.290
 instead of working at lucien like 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.730
 earlier because I'm talking about 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.850
 taste colors is more interesting it's going 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:28.750
 a little faster and we look 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:34.740
 The result is there 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:37.360
 yeah that's called red 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.930
 so here I have a picture that I like 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.030
 geneviève 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.650
 however, I have two problems on 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.420
 first is really his shading that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.490
 is very very pronounced if I want 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.380
 decrease that age shadow when I'm going 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.060
 to do is I'm going to you too 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.610
 light source so for that I'm going 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.709
 use a little pebble pebble afraid that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.430
 I can put that word that's your 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.620
 relationship so as to swell a little bit 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.030
 can I change the red distance 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.450
 a place depending on the height of the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.580
 flash 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.910
 so I'm really going into his ball my 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:13.120
 flash that then that and I will redo my 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.980
 photo it does not really solve the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.750
 problem I still have shading 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.250
 but obviously geneviève and near the goal 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.049
 if she had been a little bit more 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.980
 distant stop better and the other 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.600
 thing that will happen I'll be able to 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.050
 to look through it is at the level of 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.480
 eyes 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.919
 bin lodge - the effect of red eyes 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.810
 we had everything to the same on geneviève 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.210
 it did not look like much I 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.160
 will present the cameos - but when I 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.770
 even the problem that my light and of 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.780
 face and not very interesting and if 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.490
 I was closer but I will have a risk 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.740
 also to have vignetting because of 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.610
 my goal i'm going to use now 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.570
 a 900 usb flash to solve the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.210
 crisis one thing I would like to say 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.970
 before I finish is that I work 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.540
 in such device mode is able to 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.000
 adjust 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.400
 that way if geneviève or less 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 on the move but the device will give the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.020
 amount of light available for 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.520
 to make a good exhibition 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.400
 So when you're in motion 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.140
 work in the lead and a township nyfix if the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.360
 model and I do not move we're going 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.840
 work in manual so we see each other 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.840
 to paint
