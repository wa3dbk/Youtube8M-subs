00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.129

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.670
 complicated and yes that's the angel 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.670
 You can find times 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.420
 this question has nothing special 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.760
 Actually with these systems of 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 tip the way asked what I was there 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.130
 actually cool so much better 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.590
 customized articles 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.760
 and yes the whole time metal fans with 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.789
 celebration does not do much for now 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.149
 everyone is actually bowing 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.399
 simply from the green then money because red 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.189
 and then just particle if you are good 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.640
 together a critic's are holding 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.289
 these triangles and we also in the title 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.390
 respectful place has miranda 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.740
 golf is based and she says something here 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.289
 made you say the hearts 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 the hearts are made 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.009
 the boy so that they all the own 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.990
 are the economics knowledgeable 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.490
 the dogs all the hearts of the extreme 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.579
 light and the down here the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.929
 widgets and actually cool 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.270
 Thanks again Anna in any case 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:55.039
 past when I've made couple here 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 and tnt also normal would be great here 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.909
 just as good as it was before the cure 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.219
 but the politics on 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.189
 here are also quite normal the travel 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.630
 gold also quite normal field film and yes 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.340
 here also completely new field for food so 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.939
 laterally a representative so a money 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.240
 Committed 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.960
 but I know just kinda stays somehow 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 alone if you are a bit 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:24.700
 that shows , for example, I play 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:31.800
 24 players once told the place that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:35.550
 I'll stop eating this game on 0 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.570
 2 ultimately not too many mistakes 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.010
 everything is canceled directly and so is it 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.110
 held relatively well 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 and yes I think I 'll come back 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.690
 to plead guilty to peacefully times 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.210
 yes that's just the armor or gold 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.390
 train the apparently normal the yes and 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.670
 iron as well as relatively good relative 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.450
 behaves and yes then I'll come here 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.890
 no particles like that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.130
 a button but I believe them agreed 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.730
 or so I'm so stupid I have no idea how 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.590
 get out much longer enough time I will have to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.150
 say you can definitely mine 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.510
 physical and can say the fixed 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.990
 find these are the charles particles 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.500
 here everything still broken game does not make 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.140
 more broken there are the particles and the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.940
 normal people and is actually a 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.110
 very cool way and yes for us 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.140
 when we create the 100 downloads 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.370
 would and then the 100 likes then until the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.290
 next video next year again 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.480

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.080
