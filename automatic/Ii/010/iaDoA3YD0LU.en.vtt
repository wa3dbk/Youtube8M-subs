00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
you know try and cut down a tree because

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.810 
you know try and cut down a tree because
there<00:01:48.090> seems<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:49.340> whenever<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
there seems to be whenever I do one of

there seems to be whenever I do one of
these<00:01:50.880> videos<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> always<00:01:51.479> takes<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> while<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
these videos it always takes a while to

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.330 
these videos it always takes a while to
show<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.100> features<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
show off then the features because of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.889 
show off then the features because of
how<00:01:56.340> close<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> Minecraft<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> then

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
how close it is to Minecraft and then

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
how close it is to Minecraft and then
you<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:59.570> do<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.840> before<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.619> show

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you have to do a bit before you can show

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.710 
you have to do a bit before you can show
off<00:02:02.490> stuff<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:05.329> okay<00:02:06.329> it's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
off stuff so okay it's

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
off stuff so okay it's
trees<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:09.690> we're<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.710> go<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.490> make<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
trees now we're gonna go and make a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
trees now we're gonna go and make a
