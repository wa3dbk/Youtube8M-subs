00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.110
 good now in here 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.360
 extending the rocket and garlic 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:25.560
 then I threw some chopped onion 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:31.119
 and tomato already has a good sprout 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:36.160
 I'll prepare to put the shoyu and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.920
 I use this oyster sauce equipment is 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 not mandatory but may cause 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 crying is the most important 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.350
 well that long salt sauce but I 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:59.570
 I put the number of shows and what goes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:03.190
 to give color to soybean fiber increased 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.190
 little fire was down 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 and I'll put two cups of fiber 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.890
 Soy 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:36.100
 now I've put this to the rest of the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.470
 world liked was to break because 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 obviously past 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 I thought I was little enough again 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.399
 now I'm going to put a little water 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:05.979
 to cover soybeans but to run well with 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:10.470
 paper from that sauce to finish 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:14.640
 I'll go fake and chive 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 I'll put it in here. 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.950
 I have put oyster sauce 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.840
 I did not put it very strong and it already has 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.840
 a little of such 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.220
 seems a little bit longer 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 Good now I put three cups of 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.790
 Water 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.010
 I'll let it cook a little and that's 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.830
 she can become accustomed to absorb the unique 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.900
 I'll leave the kitchen to dry this water. 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.050
 let it be loose 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.050
 the soya bean grains 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.110
 this soybean break that is easy to 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.770
 find in the green world in the house pedro 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.770
 natural products store 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.390
 with the soybean almost dried by water 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.470
 I put about a three 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.000
 titles 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:40.610
 This one from here now I'm going to put a 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.260
 position and starts to command one of the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.260
 before it dries complete 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.360
 and since it's almost dry he can 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:10.810
 put the chives I already had 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.810
 applied with parsley 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.940
 I'm going to have to take a break now, but it's 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.479
 That's it or I 'll mix it up 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.570
 leaving as soon as possible 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:34.940
 ready now to conclude is strong already 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:37.419
 dried out has no more eyes and 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.419
 eat
