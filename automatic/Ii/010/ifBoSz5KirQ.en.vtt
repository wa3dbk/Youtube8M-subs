 lg chose to make 4g sound 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 number one marketing argument to hold 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.679
 head against his big competitor samsung 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.789
 first in a series of several 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.070
 compatible smartphones 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.050
 the optimus f5 will be marketed late 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 April backed by a huge campaign 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.500
 of advertising here are our first 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 impressions before our test in 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:35.170
 laboratory to take advantage of the networks 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.280
 mobile 4g ​​it will necessarily be necessary 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.379
 compatible smartphone 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.090
 lg is counting on the re-equipment of 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.670
 consumers to win everything from 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.399
 next as the reference provider 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.370
 the optimus f5 is the first of its kind 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.930
 will be launched at the end of April at 369 euros and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.600
 should also be offered in pack 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.879
 operator for 29.39 euros in exchange 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.500
 of course a commitment of 24 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.929
 months with packages that should 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.590
 turn around 45 or 50 euros minimum 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.679
 per month 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.839
 at this price the f5 integrates obviously not 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.310
 all the latest components with sound 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.780
 4.3 inch screen 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.369
 it holds better in the hand than the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.560
 big smartphone very fashionable in this 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.760
 moment it's enough to navigate 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.950
 Internet 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.690
 published on social networks and more 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.150
 widely to take advantage of the uses of a 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.950
 smartphone its resolution is correct 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.420
 sufficient for a net display 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.040
 pity that a doubt hangs over its quality 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.440
 processor side it integrates a double 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.120
 heart clocked at 1.2giguere very 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.260
 largely enough there too for 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.630
 hope for good performance 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.950
 lg shots on costs by limiting the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.290
 5-camera sensor 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.800
 megapixels and the internal memory to 8 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.050
 GB 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.900
 however, the ability to 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.070
 storage with a memory card 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.290
 aside the major differences 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.420
 the s5 datasheet looks like 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.979
 devilishly to that of the optimus g the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 manufacturer's high-end smartphone 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.410
 sold 549 euros the price quality ratio 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.700
 will probably give the advantage to f5 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.320
 but of course we have to wait for 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
 results of our laboratory tests 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.520
 to be sure inside not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.229
 of surprise the team is f 5 works 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.119
 also with the latest version in 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.790
 google system date android 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.709
 lg adds his software layer with it 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.910
 its own functions so we can 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.910
 take notes at any time 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.720
 display multiple functions on the screen 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.470
 or zoom in a captured video with 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.820
 the phone our tests will deliver their 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.920
 verdict as to the performance of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.430
 phone its autonomy and comfort 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.340
 used to 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.230
 if the optimus f5 keeps its promises lg 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.090
 will have shown that the 4g is not 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.330
 exclusively for smartphones 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330
