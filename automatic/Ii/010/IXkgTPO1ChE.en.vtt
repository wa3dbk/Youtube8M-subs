00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
took all the dust out cuz i have an air
compressor<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> cleaned<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> whole

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
compressor so I cleaned out the whole

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
compressor so I cleaned out the whole
thing<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:55.920> together

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
thing and then so I put it back together

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.319 
thing and then so I put it back together
so<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.180> looked<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.540> new<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.939> what<00:01:59.939> happened

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so it looked like new and what happened

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
so it looked like new and what happened
was<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.049> playing<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> had<00:02:01.920> no<00:02:02.040> problems

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
was I was playing and I had no problems

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.090 
was I was playing and I had no problems
that<00:02:02.610> night<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> decided<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.619> play<00:02:04.770> again

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that night then I decided to play again

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.229 
that night then I decided to play again
and<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:06.450> happened<00:02:06.840> again<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:08.640> stumbled

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and it happened again and I stumbled

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
and it happened again and I stumbled
upon<00:02:09.300> another<00:02:09.599> video<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.500> figured<00:02:10.800> out

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
upon another video and I figured out

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
upon another video and I figured out
that's<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> heat<00:02:12.090> sink

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
that's the heat sink

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.520 
that's the heat sink
now<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.210> knew<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.630> he'd<00:02:13.750> seen<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:13.990> first<00:02:14.380> time

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
now I knew that he'd seen the first time

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.380 
now I knew that he'd seen the first time
but<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.920> thought<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> heatsink<00:02:15.700> wasn't<00:02:16.210> there

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
but I thought the heatsink wasn't there

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.270 
but I thought the heatsink wasn't there
but<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.750> figured<00:02:17.050> out<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.710> have<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.980> glue<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
but I figured out you have to glue it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.370 
but I figured out you have to glue it
and<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.030> not<00:02:19.090> glued<00:02:19.450> tight<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.960> if<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and if it's not glued tight and if it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.630 
and if it's not glued tight and if it
doesn't<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> lot<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.130> has<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.520> much

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
doesn't have a lot of it has too much

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.570 
doesn't have a lot of it has too much
space<00:02:22.000> or<00:02:22.330> too<00:02:22.450> much<00:02:22.630> air<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:24.190> will<00:02:24.340> allow

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
space or too much air then it will allow

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.670 
space or too much air then it will allow
eat<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.960> get<00:02:26.140> some<00:02:26.470> type<00:02:26.650> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
eat so I have to get some type of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.380 
eat so I have to get some type of
thermal<00:02:27.220> glue<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.820> have<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.030> reglue<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
thermal glue and I have to reglue it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.190 
thermal glue and I have to reglue it
myself<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.100> will<00:02:30.730> once<00:02:31.030> again<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.690> take

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
myself so I will once again have to take

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
myself so I will once again have to take
apart<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.560> my<00:02:32.620> ps3<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:35.410> not<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:37.000> really

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
apart of my ps3 and it's not like really

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.460 
apart of my ps3 and it's not like really
hard<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.100> not<00:02:39.340> easy<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:41.110> there's<00:02:41.380> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
hard but it's not easy like there's a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
hard but it's not easy like there's a
lot<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.710> screws<00:02:42.130> probably<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.730> 30<00:02:43.120> screws

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
lot of screws probably like 30 screws

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.630 
lot of screws probably like 30 screws
and<00:02:43.720> all<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> remember<00:02:45.280> like

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and all and you have to remember like

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.880 
and all and you have to remember like

we're all of them go so i would highly

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.310 
we're all of them go so i would highly

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.220 
room and then I'll give him her and then
she<00:02:55.450> had<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> piece<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.750> paper<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.020> she'll

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
she had a piece of paper and she'll

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.320 
she had a piece of paper and she'll
write<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.620> name<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.040> down<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:57.610> we

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
write the name of it down and then we

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.760 
write the name of it down and then we
would<00:02:58.480> tape<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.080> certain<00:02:59.230> area<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.740> you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
would tape it in a certain area so you

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.100 
would tape it in a certain area so you
know<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.370> where<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.610> went<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.990> that's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
know we know where it went and that's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.750 
know we know where it went and that's
how<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.290> did<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.950> have<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.280> take<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.580> apart

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
how we did it so I have to take it apart

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.190 
how we did it so I have to take it apart
again<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.180> know<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.480> should<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:04.720> easier<00:03:05.050> this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
again you know it should be easier this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.370 
again you know it should be easier this
time<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:07.240> know<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.570> feel<00:03:07.870> as<00:03:07.990> long<00:03:08.200> as<00:03:08.320> you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
time you know I feel as long as you

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.440 
time you know I feel as long as you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
remember everything goes it's not a hard

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.990 
remember everything goes it's not a hard
task<00:03:11.040> something<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.370> anyone<00:03:12.790> can

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
task something that like anyone can

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.510 
task something that like anyone can
accomplish<00:03:13.300> i<00:03:13.600> believe<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:15.400> pretty

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
cool to actually like look inside a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.780 
cool to actually like look inside a
playstation<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:19.150> kind<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:19.390> see<00:03:19.510> how<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.750> works

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
playstation to kind of see how it works

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
playstation to kind of see how it works

that<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.790> i<00:03:33.790> think<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:35.110> i<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.560> fix<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.980> and

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
that and i think that i can fix this and

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.979 
that and i think that i can fix this and
hopefully<00:03:36.880> are<00:03:37.000> always<00:03:37.209> chapter<00:03:37.450> by<00:03:37.570> new<00:03:37.780> one

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
hopefully are always chapter by new one

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.810 
hopefully are always chapter by new one
but<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> problem<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.190> i<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.550> how<00:03:39.730> I'm

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
but the problem is i don't know how I'm

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.040 
but the problem is i don't know how I'm
gonna<00:03:39.940> get<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.270> information<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.840> hard

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050
