00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
so the last car of the day was the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.410 
so the last car of the day was the
Corvette<00:00:18.330> c7<00:00:19.260> stingray<00:00:19.700> now<00:00:20.700> again<00:00:21.030> here's

Corvette c7 stingray now again here's

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.480 
Corvette c7 stingray now again here's
one<00:00:21.690> lap<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.170> only<00:00:22.410> got<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.770> lap<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
one lap I only got one lap in it and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:03:26.360 
one lap I only got one lap in it and
let's<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.360> take<00:00:24.540> a<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:24.930> this

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.720 

you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.780 

so<00:03:29.390> there's<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.690> reason<00:03:29.930> why<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.379> Corvette<00:03:31.069> c7

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
so there's a reason why the Corvette c7

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.720 
so there's a reason why the Corvette c7
was<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.360> last<00:03:32.780> car<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.680> test<00:03:34.010> right<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
was the last car of the test right and

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.509 
was the last car of the test right and
it's<00:03:35.569> because<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.110> felt<00:03:36.349> like<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:37.040> was<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
it's because I felt like this was the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.430 
it's because I felt like this was the
best<00:03:37.730> all-around<00:03:38.060> driving<00:03:38.720> experience<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.290> had

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.920 
anyway so in sport too on the track mode
I<00:04:24.110> found<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:25.030> immediately<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.389> felt

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
I found that immediately I felt

comfortable<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.680> car<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:29.600> see

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
comfortable in this car and you can see

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.270 
comfortable in this car and you can see
in<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.950> lap<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:32.060> comfort<00:04:32.919> translated<00:04:33.919> into<00:04:34.100> a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
in the lap the comfort translated into a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.460 
in the lap the comfort translated into a
pretty<00:04:34.760> probably<00:04:35.479> look<00:04:35.660> one<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> quickest

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
pretty probably look one of the quickest

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.190 
pretty probably look one of the quickest
drives<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:36.950> had<00:04:37.130> done<00:04:37.280> all<00:04:37.490> day<00:04:38.200> steering

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200

drives that I had done all day steering
feel<00:04:39.410> was<00:04:39.710> spot-on<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:41.120> turned<00:04:41.360> in<00:04:41.510> exactly

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
feel was spot-on it turned in exactly

but unlike the 370z where the car kind
of<00:04:47.510> looks<00:04:47.750> big<00:04:48.050> but<00:04:48.260> felt<00:04:48.889> huge<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.729> don't

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
of looks big but felt huge you don't

of looks big but felt huge you don't
feel<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.389> in<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.630> c7<00:04:51.139> or<00:04:51.260> at<00:04:51.320> least<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.680> didn't

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
feel that in the c7 or at least I didn't

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.969 
feel that in the c7 or at least I didn't
brakes<00:04:53.090> were<00:04:53.389> you<00:04:53.900> know<00:04:53.990> exactly<00:04:54.500> where<00:04:54.860> you

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
brakes were you know exactly where you

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.640 
brakes were you know exactly where you
needed<00:04:55.220> him<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.610> be<00:04:55.729> on<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> track<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.330> this

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
needed him to be on a track like this

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.870 
needed him to be on a track like this
and<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.740> think<00:04:57.950> I<00:04:58.039> hit<00:04:58.160> about<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.430> hundred<00:04:58.789> and

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
and I think I hit about a hundred and

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.960 
and I think I hit about a hundred and
forty<00:04:59.650> something<00:05:00.650> miles<00:05:01.100> an<00:05:01.280> hour<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.639> it<00:05:01.669> and

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
forty something miles an hour on it and

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.760 
forty something miles an hour on it and
it<00:05:02.240> just<00:05:02.270> felt<00:05:02.660> like<00:05:02.780> nothing<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.229> stability

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
it just felt like nothing the stability

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.980 
it just felt like nothing the stability
was<00:05:03.979> there<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.700> never<00:05:04.850> felt<00:05:05.210> high-speed

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
was there you never felt high-speed

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.760 
was there you never felt high-speed
instability<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.010> was<00:05:07.130> always<00:05:07.490> balanced<00:05:08.770> just

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
instability it was always balanced just

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.370 
instability it was always balanced just

the car overall driving experience was

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.860 
the car overall driving experience was
every<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.520> checked<00:05:13.820> every<00:05:14.240> box<00:05:14.510> that<00:05:14.660> did

something<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.210> was<00:05:17.360> lacking<00:05:17.599> except<00:05:18.200> while

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
something that was lacking except while

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.409 
something that was lacking except while
this<00:05:18.710> car<00:05:18.919> had<00:05:19.070> an<00:05:19.190> automatic<00:05:19.490> trans<00:05:19.940> which<00:05:20.180> I

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
this car had an automatic trans which I

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.510 
this car had an automatic trans which I
could<00:05:20.810> have<00:05:20.930> done<00:05:21.080> without<00:05:21.320> honestly<00:05:22.010> it's

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
could have done without honestly it's

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.159 
could have done without honestly it's
not<00:05:22.669> that<00:05:22.849> the<00:05:22.940> auto<00:05:23.120> trans<00:05:23.479> was<00:05:23.630> bad<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:24.020> and

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
not that the auto trans was bad on and

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.830 
not that the auto trans was bad on and
it<00:05:24.229> was<00:05:24.349> really<00:05:24.740> quick<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.340> shift<00:05:25.669> but<00:05:26.479> I'm

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
it was really quick to shift but I'm

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.390 
it was really quick to shift but I'm
glad<00:05:27.020> there's<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.380> manual<00:05:27.770> option<00:05:28.160> here

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
glad there's a manual option here

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.379 
glad there's a manual option here
because<00:05:28.639> that<00:05:28.729> was<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:28.910> only<00:05:29.000> thing<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.330> could

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
because that was the only thing I could

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.710 
because that was the only thing I could
possibly<00:05:29.560> complain<00:05:30.560> about
