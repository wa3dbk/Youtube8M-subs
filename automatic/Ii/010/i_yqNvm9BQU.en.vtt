 He can get someone from here. 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 made ex point because it's the phone team 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 Hawaiian android system knew the staff 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.869

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.940
 and everything that's going on in this game is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.069
 all nintendo né script 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.870
 the best because pikachu except né 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.720
 so the staff will play the game is the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.099
 back to poverty 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.200
 battaglia psol also that obvious team 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.450

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.860
 mouse and click on it it will get wholesale 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.700
 smaller as you find if the mouth 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.799
 same 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 has a difference or does it pass it pula 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.239
 squeezing one he'll see that it goes 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.549
 to start an attack will give an attack if 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.230
 press the mouse button and attack bars 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.950
 tv that I came back to pokémon that are very 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.470
 tapir 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.019
 let's go there again damn dog have a 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.269
 will return home with him here just to share 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.459
 every pokémon time I realized right 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.810
 I realized not obvious we are not going there or 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.209
 try to defeat the pib continue as 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.330
 already has six Pokémon that are the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.780
 who has this map right question here of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.400
 side of the vehicle and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.850
 heard a little of the led because 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.440
 I did not think it was very good, it just is not it. 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.700
 It's all because monster already said that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.010
 keep repeating 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 He also has other attacks on the dog. 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.430
 because they think they are losing 2 in this 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.019
 question left to the holy thunder 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.010
 it's not very simple either 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.790
 button 1 is the trailer gives a football to 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.060
 also do not give her 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.069
 I have this kind of thing it has 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.530
 very secret game it basically this 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.410
 kills death auditon the knot 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.269
 dies that the funds will be very 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.750
 high and I tried to configure which is the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.750
 maximum 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.640
 let's see is that wager around the sun 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.510
 it is not only with perceived it is much better than 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.430
 that any model comes in so order and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.680
 years, type pokémon knows there was 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.000
 interesting guy so returning this 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.579
 game 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.310
 opel to separate the animation from the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.910
 attacks that are but also well done right 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.650
 Look the attacking nation is very well made 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.720
 It's interesting the gameplay system is 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.000
 fuck but the graph interests me 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.410
 but the graphic is interesting 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.870
 I also said that it's a fuck, anyway 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.440
 I worked, I just may not 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.780

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.150
 Ah is that to play so the staff you 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.650

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 chose you know an example I 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.610

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.320

 Do not squeeze the teb it'll be there too. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.030

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.860
 ready are fulfilled here just 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.229
 aborted because he and I have an attack 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.700
 interestingly the staff uses the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.130
 first flight attack was wasting space 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.789
 Are you going to make this fly so let's go? 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.770

 take and play life for himself is 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:42.200
 better and cooperates life or is opponent 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:51.940

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:51.940

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:05.060
