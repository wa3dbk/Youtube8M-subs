00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
spot you can actually cover a lot of

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.950 
spot you can actually cover a lot of
water<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.860> cast<00:00:47.550> further<00:00:47.970> upstream<00:00:48.330> I<00:00:48.780> can

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
water I can cast further upstream I can

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
water I can cast further upstream I can
cast<00:00:49.589> downstream<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.640> feed<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> little

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
cast downstream and feed out a little

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
cast downstream and feed out a little
bit<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> line<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.320> make<00:00:52.620> longer<00:00:52.949> drifts

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
bit of line so I can make longer drifts

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.509 
bit of line so I can make longer drifts
and<00:00:53.730> swings<00:00:54.470> but<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> carefully<00:00:56.309> work

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
and swings but I want to carefully work

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.240 
and swings but I want to carefully work
over<00:00:56.989> every<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.470> water<00:00:58.799> because<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
over every bit of this water because I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.000 
over every bit of this water because I
think<00:00:59.460> there's<00:00:59.640> more<00:00:59.820> steelhead<00:01:00.299> out<00:01:00.479> here

fly lines which I have on

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.709 
fly lines which I have on
if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.640> always<00:01:33.000> start<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.570> rod<00:01:33.689> tip

if you always start with your rod tip
down<00:01:33.990> low<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.710> tight<00:01:34.950> line<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.490> easy

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
down low in a tight line you're easy

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
down low in a tight line you're easy
it's<00:01:36.149> much<00:01:36.509> easier<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> better<00:01:37.380> cast

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's much easier to get a better cast

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.580 
it's much easier to get a better cast
for<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.520> example<00:01:38.939> I'll<00:01:39.600> bring<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.409> like
