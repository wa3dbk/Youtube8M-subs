00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.530
 Dell throwing 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.680
 Buy a new pc today 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.870
 I also added a new front keyboard 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.169
 Iwamizawa agriculture 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.419
 Aiko 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.559
 It seems to be meaningful with Komori 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.559
 I am not very familiar with Japanese people 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.050
 The mattress is late 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.179
 As it is now 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.199
 I went 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.899
 In fact, it is South Canada Japan 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.179
 But I was following 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.179
 Japanese as a keyboard keyboard 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.890
 Japanese company 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.620
 I'm getting some Japanese though 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.569
 In that 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.569
 I'm getting red, I'm listening to my feet 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.630
 Though it was a junior, I thought last of the mountain back 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.780
 Well today Microsoft net 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 Even compare 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 To me 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.460
 There is a good argument in the net belkin 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 1052 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.130
 Do not ask 52.2 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.440
 I'm shining but 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.870
 Part of going out of school 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.150
 As an interesting feature 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550
 Here 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.800
 There was a touch pad in my alma mater 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.960
 I also responded to the post 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.220
 But if you press 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 this street 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 Cheer club more than 50 years 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 Well used for online games 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.460
 It is a movement of front and back, right and left 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 Hit the ball 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.490
 Light up 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 The color is a little different 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.460
 This also falls close to the reaction 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 25 schools in the same school 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.540
 I think this will 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 Like me but this 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.190
 There is also Hanno city 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.220
 A little 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.690
 I'm not sure 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.090
 The organization of the country of Dickinou is more than a membranee 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.819
 decided 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.269
 There is such an interesting function 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.569
 Other than that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 Slightly invisible 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.099
 Media is bad 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.099
 Become a control panel and get media 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.359
 I stood inside of me but 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.050
 You can do various things 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.089
 Also this is 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.879
 From the pc body 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.679
 To the speaker cable 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.700
 Maeguchi Noriyuki 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.349
 here 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.839
 Is growing 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.719
 We can do the seminar together here 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 Connect the speaker and the microphone from here 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.589
 It is said that you can be a director again at hand 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.599
 Well keep a little funny 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.599
 I will use two usb terminals for total rehabilitation though 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.189
 It is quite tough 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.939
 In winter, we will be the secretary of Karagisu 24 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.069
 As usual mind Makiyama 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.889
 Shiny 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 Back fat 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.079
 Genghis Khan Piano Black Is it? 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.679
 Soft before burning coconut 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.649
 It feels like 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 Guinness class 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.709
 jta here part from the muffler 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.539
 Because I'm biscuit 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:30.639
 Fight for the first time 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.869
 I do not have an ear 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:34.690
 Yeah 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.690
 Accessories are very Australian 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.829
 Miki Saeki about what this is 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.409
 The remaining Japanese 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.719
 Of each temple 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.879
 Manual 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.879
 If that happens 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.949
 It is from now on 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.189
 It has a seal and a seal 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.239
 I laugh at the top 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.399
 This is also very warm on 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.399
 There is a sweet and tortuous function written 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.449
 Finally 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.650
 With driver's disc I can't get sixty two steps without this 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.669
 It is 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.580
 I have no choice but to comfort me 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 On the 8th 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.219
 s 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.629
 It is quick 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.300
 in this way 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.590
 US g3 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.409
 When it comes to spring 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.409
 You can also use a microphone and speakers 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.129
 1st 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.960
 Quick installed 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.749
 I'll follow you 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.270
 This was the first time next season 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.499
 It is a paper I do not know well 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.259
 It is really the key 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.259
 It is an anchor greeting card 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.650
 Hearer kaz movie 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 It is other productivity 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.069
 There are a lot of bright things now 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.689
 I'm worried 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.249
 It's a rice cracker 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.839
 s 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.839
 Another bag is included 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.909
 It has not been in many years 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.210
 It looks like this as a Danish proposal 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.210
 It was vague 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.409
 High school students not allowed 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.270
 You're right 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.270
 When you press this 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.139
 Surely the reaction is 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.849
 It's shining 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.319
 It takes a while to flow 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.520
 It takes you using that normal Japanese keyboard 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.939
 Man 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.490
 Man this 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.849
 Because it is very short, so short 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.490
 If not even this 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.550
 I think I can use it 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.140
 that's all
