00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.029
 my name is daniela von braun in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
 Germany I would like to give you a short introduction today 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.010
 our latest achievement in the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 Brown series introduce our moral 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 we have her on the ifa this year 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 presented and we have now with the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.840
 Orally she finally benefits 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.760
 we know that they have to see 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.230
 probably the similarity to the stretcher 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.520
 the browning automatic mature and us 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.640
 know yes there is a story of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.129
 about 50 60 years back brown 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.840
 automatic rifle by john moses browning 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.590
 and for one was the cold sky 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.450
 on which a manufacturer produce 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.060
 to the other of perfectly functioning 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.700
 and secure locking systems with the 7 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:24.859
 wart turn lock and ergonomics 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.740
 the weapon when you look at fed 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:30.409
 magazine remains in the unloaded state 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.079
 the shutter opens another one 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.670
 safety aspect 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.479
 we can then either slowly 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.770
 Weapon guide or we can make the choice 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.779
 fast forward let the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.490
 lock 

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:45.770
 We have what they look like the hand 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.929
 tensioner as a further safety aspect 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.319
 just not right now 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:56.749
 It is very important to them to think things through 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.209
 three main features of the moral ans 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.700
 to lay down or show off 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.249
 For one thing, they've just noticed 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.789
 to credit with a cri cri logic 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.979
 system 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.530
 We work here with a return spring 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.569
 instead of the pressure system the bar 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.099
 that means they only have one way 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.319
 which is an enormous hunt 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.439
 advantage is and again in addition to 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.340
 the speediness again 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.540
 foreground puts you back 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.609
 and leave the lock or the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.469
 Chambers set off that is called the marat 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.590
 closes automatically by this 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:34.590
 return spring with the rotation was to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.780
 Closure of the hand tensioner completely 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.530
 important aspect of safety see us 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.939
 but he can click here as well 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.609
 sitting quietly exciting then we have 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.439
 worked with our in flex pet das 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.819
 means larger calibers like ours 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:56.099
 popular 93 30 06 et cetera takes it 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.500
 an insane recoil or 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.040
 or the rebound is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.469
 insanely diminished and it is thus 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.019
 always a goal lures the shutter 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.439
 remains in the system that is also in the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.439
 attack 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.760
 nothing comes before the eye 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.409
 Since I can 100 percent on the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.409
 focus and my goal 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:07.880
 to introduce the moral weapons country tv 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.880
 will accompany you
