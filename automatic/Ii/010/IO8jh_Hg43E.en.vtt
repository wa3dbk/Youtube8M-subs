had a 4 vs free situation because he

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.869

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.210 
you had back-to-back MVPs how do you
keep<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.110> up<00:04:31.169> going<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.590> super<00:04:31.889> weak<00:04:32.010> and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
keep that up going to super weak and

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.460 
keep that up going to super weak and
then<00:04:32.400> playoffs<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.810> don't<00:04:33.990> really<00:04:34.139> need<00:04:34.320> to

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
then playoffs you don't really need to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.830 
then playoffs you don't really need to
keep<00:04:34.620> your<00:04:34.740> stats<00:04:35.010> up<00:04:35.250> like<00:04:35.610> if<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.060> go<00:04:36.270> free<00:04:36.630> but

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
mmm I think it's a pretty tough one to

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.730 
mmm I think it's a pretty tough one to
call<00:05:26.190> because<00:05:26.850> I<00:05:27.150> don't<00:05:27.600> think<00:05:27.690> soo<00:05:28.350> bahk<00:05:28.530> crew

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.700 
call because I don't think soo bahk crew
look<00:05:28.979> that<00:05:29.370> hot<00:05:29.610> yesterday<00:05:29.880> but<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.960> gambled

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
look that hot yesterday but I gambled

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.060 
look that hot yesterday but I gambled
obviously<00:05:32.250> did<00:05:32.430> against<00:05:32.760> sk<00:05:33.120> but<00:05:33.870> i<00:05:34.320> think<00:05:34.770> if

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
obviously did against sk but i think if

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.130 
obviously did against sk but i think if
supercrew<00:05:35.610> place<00:05:35.880> as<00:05:36.060> well<00:05:36.240> as<00:05:36.539> they're<00:05:36.900> doing

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
supercrew place as well as they're doing

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.870 
supercrew place as well as they're doing
in<00:05:37.260> scrims<00:05:37.620> then<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.280> would<00:05:38.400> be<00:05:38.490> pretty<00:05:38.700> good

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
in scrims then they would be pretty good

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.460 
in scrims then they would be pretty good
but<00:05:39.090> i<00:05:39.120> think<00:05:39.360> gambit<00:05:39.720> will<00:05:39.810> our<00:05:39.990> team<00:05:40.260> fight

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
but i think gambit will our team fight

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.740 
but i think gambit will our team fight
them<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.919> win<00:05:41.160> in<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.430> mid-late<00:05:41.729> game<00:05:41.970> Trevor

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
them and win in the mid-late game Trevor

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.450 
them and win in the mid-late game Trevor
yeah<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.260> have<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.710> agree<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:44.010> feel<00:05:44.250> like<00:05:44.340> you

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
yeah I have to agree I feel like you

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.740 
yeah I have to agree I feel like you
might<00:05:44.580> have<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.880> edge<00:05:45.030> going<00:05:45.450> into<00:05:45.630> this<00:05:45.690> game

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
might have the edge going into this game

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.690 
might have the edge going into this game
but<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:46.500> can't<00:05:46.740> deny<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:47.070> fact<00:05:47.190> that<00:05:47.460> about

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
but you can't deny the fact that about

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.670 
but you can't deny the fact that about
three<00:05:47.880> weeks<00:05:48.150> ago<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.690> was<00:05:49.020> super<00:05:49.289> hot<00:05:49.440> crew

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
three weeks ago it was super hot crew

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.950 
three weeks ago it was super hot crew
that<00:05:50.030> destroyed<00:05:51.030> gambit<00:05:51.539> I<00:05:51.600> think<00:05:51.750> they<00:05:51.810> beat

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
that destroyed gambit I think they beat

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.020 
that destroyed gambit I think they beat
them<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.200> 24<00:05:52.620> minutes<00:05:52.800> albeit<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:53.729> was<00:05:53.850> with

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
them in 24 minutes albeit it was with

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.730 
them in 24 minutes albeit it was with
moops<00:05:54.270> in<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.479> midland<00:05:54.780> but<00:05:55.050> we'll<00:05:55.590> have<00:05:55.680> to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
moops in the midland but we'll have to

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.629 
moops in the midland but we'll have to
see<00:05:55.889> it's<00:05:56.100> one<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.280> those<00:05:56.340> things<00:05:56.400> where

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
see it's one of those things where

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.760 
see it's one of those things where
supercrew<00:05:57.389> they<00:05:57.510> need<00:05:57.750> an<00:05:57.870> early<00:05:58.080> lead<00:05:58.229> they
