00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello everyone, Alyona is good with you 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.160
 to my channel today to me 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.020
 I would like to tell you about my 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.280
 February and March purchases 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.080
 and so i will start with varnishes i have two varnishes 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 I have one varnish from flormar 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 so here it looks like a principle on 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 his nails too I could see 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 such something roses to spring varnish not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.769
 liked in one layer looks like this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 In principle, I can see and I have a shade of 124 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.710
 principle 11 milliliters is good here 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.870
 varnish the most important thing is that he does not strip and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.379
 the second varnish which I took is golden 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.660
 rose 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.700
 plain transparent lacquer I love very much 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 transparent varnishes I already said that I and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.129
 serezhkin cover and belt can 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.610
 put in general on all the things that climb 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.989
 so I took a clear varnish rather 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.360
 just not for nails 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.379
 and in the household not so to say in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.870
 here's your new needs 11 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.299
 milliliters here, too, I wanted 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.360
 need some big take lacquer so what 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.590
 everyone else I had were small 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.040
 also acquired a brush 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.409
 he giordani gold oriflame skuy here to me 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.729
 she liked it too 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.770
 already 2 brush so here it looks in 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 principle i like it on the most 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030
 the best brush from oriflame is very convenient for her 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.969
 to wear 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 corner outer corner of the eye is dark 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.770
 shadows in the inner light and throw 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.079
 also some light shadows it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.049
 I really, really liked it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.049
 imagine foundation max more 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.689
 jar basically such a standard 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 Now we have all such jars with me 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.500
 shade 2 off-white 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.880
 Here is such a color, but I learned now 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.890
 put on the arm 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.080
 I will show it bright and so little with 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.360
 Rozovinkoy I basically similar to 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.570
 my pain but from my were but he 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.459
 too pink and not at all 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:24.280
 my skin is like this 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:28.750
 not seen not really liked cost too 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.110
 he is 32 or 36 grimace and that is me 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.910
 such a budget option well when 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.810
 finished the jar to the end already 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.010
 I will tell you the empty jars as a result 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.930
 I liked the money with too 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.390
 purchased a means to remove 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.820
 cosmetics from baiser de 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.790
 I played a facial scrub this 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.550
 remedy in the Himalayas then she thought 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 even take it for yourself and try it yourself 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.239
 once failed to take first 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.940
 such a product yes for the same it 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.459
 play and decided to try it in 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 principle liked and not really nothing to 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.440
 I had been told to compare before 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.989
 even before this garnier so no one 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.420
 garnett in greenbacks basically all this 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.970
 such a mass market 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.370
 principle the same can not say that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.950
 one such makeup remover 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.980
 it is too different from the other 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 the ink washes away and thanks for that in principle 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.180
 I like it, I think it's empty 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.400
 jars I'll tell you exactly how much 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.530
 it sufficed and coped well 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.049
 because I also have so much of it 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.530
 used and did not even reach half 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.060
 to be so more objective further 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.840
 There is a product that causes me 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.510
 such 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.790
 assigned thoughts here I am led to 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.379
 recommendations by bloggers just by the way 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.290
 the second product I bought under 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.349
 the influence of youtube and 2 product clean and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.599
 this mask is intense is a mask for 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.580
 hair from a clean recovery line 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.230
 volume this mask is declared as 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.280
 restoring hair structure from the roots 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.620
 to the tips 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.709
 gives hair volume without weighting 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.549
 hair and elastic shiny 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.190
 volume is not the same thing that I would like 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.400
 to have me worrying more 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.769
 my dry tips that split and me 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.680
 would like more than that 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.049
 nutrient to know and but it is written here 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 recovery to restored structure 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.820
 hair so actually killed this 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.729
 mask not so much for volume as for 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.660
 I have already used recovery somewhere 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.940
 half for damaged and thin hair 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.860
 if they said that's me damaged 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.919
 hair and all sorts of dyeing 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.199
 a hair dryer and I took on damaged hair 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.160
 my this mask does not work 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.639
 the volume is basically not on the roots and this mask 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.639
 I put it in the middle and up to 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.300
 tip and so probably me this mask 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:59.410
 I don't like it very well because 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.150
 not very nourishing hair and especially 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.610
 I didn't understand the ends of my hair at all 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.490
 how does it work and does it work 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.610
 that during this period the use of which 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.930
 I used it I certainly will finish 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.419
 Ilya in empty jars will share 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.520
 your full impression and the last and 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.100
 such an acquisition is already with decorative 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.949
 cosmetics and such mask larina I you 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:30.949
 showed the blog itself March 8th such 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:34.039
 here's a box of focus and this is how it looks 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.520
 she reticulation eyeshadow 12 light 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:44.330
 matte shades 01 look like this 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:47.090
 Catherine I do not really like them 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.240
 matt but not chalky they crumble and 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.130
 they fit very well very gently it 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.110
 probably the softest dull shadows 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.000
 which I had because I 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.720
 There was a period in my life when I was dull 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.630
 the shadows simply did not respect and generally considered 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.240
 why should matte shadows 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.240
 I do not understand the occasion 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.580
 I'm crazy pretty budget and cool 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.100
 paletka and moto, which is only 26 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.720
 hryvnia so still money is very very cool 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.760
 and I'm not a fan of buying such palettes 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.520
 that all bloggers have I want 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.250
 find something for sure no one 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.690
 There is no such palette exactly on YouTube 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.240
 who does not have 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.480
 throw me a link but I'm more than sure 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.300
 that I'm more than sure that all others 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.250
 nakida type palettes and others 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.380
 here is the budget palette which pleases me 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.300
 very much and very glad that I did not 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.670
 I had to pay for them 200 hryvnia and 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.610
 more than 26 hryvnia if she me through 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.180
 I will not be tired of throwing them out a month 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.370
 remember 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.980
 but strand and that will happen because 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.570
 Again, I will tell you very swatches 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.010
 I really like very soft shadows 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:09.430
 now my eyes 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:12.010
 I do not know whether she is pleased with Pavlova 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.350
 very soon i will be such an ardent fan 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.620
 matte shadows holding up and children are not good 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.870
 just wonderful and basically i'm still 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.940
 Once again I am very pleased 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.050
 I am shopping for February and March I hope 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.230
 you liked them 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.420
 more accurate reviews about my products i 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.880
 I will do either in a separate review or 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.460
 empty jars because wait for new videos 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.960
