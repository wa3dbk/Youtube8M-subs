video<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:18.860> I've<00:00:19.160> always<00:00:19.340> considered<00:00:19.640> them<00:00:20.120> to

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
video and I've always considered them to

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.850 
video and I've always considered them to
be<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.600> unknown<00:00:20.810> defense<00:00:21.440> that<00:00:21.680> your

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
be the unknown defense that your

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.370 
be the unknown defense that your

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
opponent can't see coming and I think

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.260 
opponent can't see coming and I think
that<00:00:24.560> it<00:00:24.710> really<00:00:25.130> goes<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.340> show<00:00:25.520> how

that it really goes to show how

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.510

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.490 
but I'll be the first to admit and a lot
of<00:04:56.850> cases<00:04:57.060> Maxie<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.990> be<00:04:58.110> straight<00:04:58.350> up

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500

playing<00:04:58.770> with<00:04:58.830> fire<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.840> sometimes<00:05:00.840> you're

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
gonna get burned I say that because
