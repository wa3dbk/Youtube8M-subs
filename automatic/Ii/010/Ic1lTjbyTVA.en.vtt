00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.000
 in many people I sewed on the photographer who is known for that because there was a 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.589
 great stage of my career 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.879
 has been with that other party tickets 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.800
 Well, I think it's a mistake of pique but also understood to understand me 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.989
 to understand me open so that I can truly express myself as I am 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.449
 then I started 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.009
 to paint me very young very small since I was little I always wanted to point 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.109
 josé painter 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.050
 I was in a hard cinema of sculpture drawing 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.250
 he knows there was a companion who talked to me about the central preserve 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.100
 that it was a photography school that moment that was a bit like the iee 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.900
 now for young people not 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.980
 posse site where it seems that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 that those who are interested in culture love being here 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.310
 wish 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.200
 Many people in the movement were also surrounding the central photo or 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.750
 there were editors of the new lens magazine that was the magazine is also very 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 precocious hour behind the movement 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.020
 and good the first time I saw and leave the developer long and magé on paper 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 I was fascinated then 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 I thought that an artist of my time had to know how to take photos 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.090
 and nothing series the first photos that I did followed were very acclaimed I was taken 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.750
 at the greatest aridity 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260
 he sees me as the young promise 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.780
 and then with my need to paint I started to mix the two things 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 I had to have made the photo stop and the Chinese alias 20 tools 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.500
 i among these those who believe in me in the world photography began to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 criticize me ducking down I was crazy I was doing I do not know what 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.990
 but I think it drags a lot of people 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.930
 open the world of the image 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.600
 to thinking that photography does not have to be just a purist photo 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.120
 which is also that this one also has but 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 which can be used for whatever you want 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 i 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 and I think that also photography and day is an expression for what you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.759
 you try at the end just making photos or 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.930
 expressing to force fiat 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.840
 but what has happened to me from the end is that instead of uniting, they already stop 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 turn separate the photograph 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.650
 then efe 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.259
 I love pure photos 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.889
 I find it more 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.849
 even with koning with an expensive that with digital and all this to a kind of 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.609
 retouching that looks a lot like the photos he does painted 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.069
 but it is another more current means faster 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.230
 different but 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.579
 very interesting 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.479
 and then painted with nothing 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:30.009
 he even painted hoops and painting or nesme frikada a wall on a wooden sa 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
 the hydraulic lime post in that test and painted with paint 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.729
 i am writing poetry 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.609
 both ways I hope 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.789
 I made one in the year 87 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.419
 that for me it was a great picture I do not know what it was but in the end it seems like a 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.839
 performance 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.979
 and this medium a movie montage also a theater this set design were three 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.379
 represent all the myth of atalanta and convenience the lions of cibeles 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.859
 in the middle of the Madrid fountain so that all the traffic I do not know what went 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.729
 it went like this because I wanted to do it but I did not know what I was doing 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.059
 so little 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.009
 and from there I think that 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.839
 It has been many years 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:09.609
 and now as a queen 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.209
 the people I love that kind of things do not 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.719
 is doing many different things even with people who participate that 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.219
 it may seem like fifteen hundred people 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.219
 that in a kalise seen that I have not seen the one that suddenly act as only 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.289
 body 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.000
 and things happen magical me not 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.240
 and at the risk of not knowing what will happen if you are assaulted badly if you are not going to go 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.850
 nobody will go three thousand instead of thousand
