00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
hey this is Tom of the verge and we're

hey this is Tom of the verge and we're
looking<00:00:05.279> at<00:00:05.339> Microsoft's<00:00:05.819> new<00:00:06.029> surface<00:00:06.569> free

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
looking at Microsoft's new surface free

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.709 
looking at Microsoft's new surface free
tablet<00:00:07.519> that's<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.610> surface<00:00:09.000> free<00:00:09.240> not<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
tablet that's a surface free not the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.900 
tablet that's a surface free not the
surface<00:00:10.200> pro<00:00:10.469> free<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> ten<00:00:11.759> point

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
surface pro free this is a ten point

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.940 
surface pro free this is a ten point
eight<00:00:12.179> inch<00:00:12.420> tablet<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.620> gone<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
eight inch tablet and so it's gone up a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.310 
eight inch tablet and so it's gone up a
little<00:00:14.130> bit<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.849> size<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.780> previous

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
little bit in in size from the previous

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.519 
little bit in in size from the previous
version<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.060> it's<00:00:18.060> free<00:00:18.630> by<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:18.960> aspect

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
version and it's free by two aspect

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
version and it's free by two aspect
ratio<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.039> -<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.490> kind<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> turning<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.330> more

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
ratio so - is kind of turning this more

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.980 
ratio so - is kind of turning this more
into<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> tablet<00:00:22.350> than<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.769> surface<00:00:23.430> -<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.990> big

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
into a tablet than the surface - was big

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.589 
into a tablet than the surface - was big
changes<00:00:25.470> you've<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> new<00:00:26.789> hinge<00:00:27.060> design<00:00:27.300> on

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
changes you've got a new hinge design on

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.460 
changes you've got a new hinge design on
the<00:00:27.689> back<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.619> pops<00:00:29.039> free<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.900> two

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the back which pops free way so one two

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
the back which pops free way so one two
and<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:31.920> three<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.480> exactly

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and then three it's kind of not exactly

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.870 
and then three it's kind of not exactly
the<00:00:34.020> same<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> surface<00:00:34.770> pro<00:00:34.950> free<00:00:35.190> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the same as the surface pro free but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.240 
the same as the surface pro free but
gives<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> little<00:00:36.450> bit<00:00:36.630> flexibility<00:00:37.260> under

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
gives you a little bit flexibility under

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.490 
gives you a little bit flexibility under
the<00:00:38.520> hood<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> biggest<00:00:39.780> change<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the hood is the the biggest change and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
the hood is the the biggest change and
this<00:00:40.710> isn't<00:00:40.890> Windows<00:00:41.250> RT<00:00:41.460> anymore<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.030> there's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this isn't Windows RT anymore so there's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
this isn't Windows RT anymore so there's
no<00:00:42.300> ARM<00:00:42.570> processor<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.379> you've<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.219> an

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
no ARM processor in here you've got an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
no ARM processor in here you've got an
add-on<00:00:44.430> processor<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:45.570> does<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:46.050> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
add-on processor which does mean that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
add-on processor which does mean that
you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.500> run<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.950> traditional<00:00:47.579> desktop<00:00:47.969> app

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you can run your traditional desktop app

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can run your traditional desktop app
so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.870> iTunes<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so you know iTunes on here you can have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.330 
so you know iTunes on here you can have
all<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> full<00:00:51.239> office<00:00:51.629> applications

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
all the full office applications

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.299 
all the full office applications
Steinway<00:00:53.340> v1<00:00:53.870> true<00:00:54.870> Windows<00:00:55.289> rather<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
Steinway v1 true Windows rather than the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639 
Steinway v1 true Windows rather than the
Windows<00:00:56.940> RT<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.480> didn't<00:00:58.199> didn't<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
Windows RT which didn't didn't have all

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
Windows RT which didn't didn't have all
that<00:00:58.710> support<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> running<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.940> an

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that support so it's running on an

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
that support so it's running on an
accent<00:01:00.600> processor<00:01:00.930> its<00:01:01.140> quad<00:01:01.320> core<00:01:01.530> processor

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
accent processor its quad core processor

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
accent processor its quad core processor
and<00:01:02.160> you've<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> 10.8<00:01:03.719> English<00:01:04.049> display

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and you've got a 10.8 English display

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
and you've got a 10.8 English display
which<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.619> nineteen<00:01:05.489> twenty<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:05.880> twelve

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
which is nineteen twenty by twelve

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
which is nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.320> while<00:01:07.470> there's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> Batson

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
eighty so while there's a Batson

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
eighty so while there's a Batson
processor<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.390> performance<00:01:09.600> seems

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
processor in here the performance seems

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
processor in here the performance seems
okay<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> review<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> fully

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
okay but I'll have to review it fully

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510 
okay but I'll have to review it fully
and<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.930> how<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.080> goes<00:01:13.430> it's<00:01:14.430> pretty

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and to see how that goes it's pretty

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
and to see how that goes it's pretty
much<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.659> similar<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> surface<00:01:16.680> -<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
much very similar to the surface - I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
much very similar to the surface - I
mean<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:17.909> much<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> same<00:01:18.420> sort

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
mean it's it's pretty much the same sort

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
mean it's it's pretty much the same sort
of<00:01:18.720> thickness<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.590> changed<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> few

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
of thickness they have changed a few

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.890 
of thickness they have changed a few
things<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> side<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> you've<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
things on the side here and you've got a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530 
things on the side here and you've got a
micro<00:01:22.320> USB<00:01:22.350> port<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> power

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
micro USB port now and that's the power

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
micro USB port now and that's the power
port<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.020> now<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.159> playing<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> the

device<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:42.990> clean<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> there's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
device is pretty clean and there's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
device is pretty clean and there's
nothing<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.159> apart<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.850> kickstand

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
nothing there apart from the kickstand

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.380 
nothing there apart from the kickstand
much<00:01:45.869> less<00:01:46.049> moved<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> volume<00:01:47.759> buttons<00:01:48.270> at

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
much less moved up the volume buttons at

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
much less moved up the volume buttons at
the<00:01:48.420> top<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.680> overall<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the top here but overall still kind of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.280 
the top here but overall still kind of
looking<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> same<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> surface<00:01:51.899> 2<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
looking the same as the surface 2 and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
looking the same as the surface 2 and
the<00:01:53.220> rear<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.520> got<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> new<00:01:53.850> logos<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the rear it's got a new logos as the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
the rear it's got a new logos as the
Microsoft<00:01:55.170> logo<00:01:55.409> rolling<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.950> surface<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
Microsoft logo rolling in surface and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
Microsoft logo rolling in surface and
compared<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> surface<00:01:58.200> pro<00:01:58.409> 3<00:01:58.439> is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
compared to the surface pro 3 is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.209 
compared to the surface pro 3 is
obviously<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.369> lot<00:01:59.700> smaller<00:02:00.920> dimensions<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
obviously a lot smaller dimensions and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
obviously a lot smaller dimensions and
it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.409> thinner<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it's a little bit a little bit thinner I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.340 
it's a little bit a little bit thinner I
guess<00:02:04.979> we'll<00:02:05.159> put<00:02:05.340> perhaps<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> same

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
guess we'll put perhaps kind of the same

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.570 
guess we'll put perhaps kind of the same
but<00:02:07.350> obviously<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.740> look<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:07.950> similar

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
but obviously they look very similar

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
but obviously they look very similar
because<00:02:08.700> they're<00:02:08.849> both<00:02:08.910> sitting<00:02:09.690> still<00:02:09.989> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
because they're both sitting still in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.700 
because they're both sitting still in

nation here but you can see that the

look<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.520> 12<00:02:14.760> versus<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> tenth<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
look at 12 versus the tenth this is a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.050 
look at 12 versus the tenth this is a
new<00:02:16.200> surface<00:02:16.830> type<00:02:17.190> cover<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.790> pretty

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
new surface type cover and pretty

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.120 
new surface type cover and pretty
similar<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> old<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:18.810> clicks<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:20.070> you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
similar to the old one clicks in but you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.800 
similar to the old one clicks in but you
got<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> new<00:02:20.460> magnets<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.060> stick<00:02:21.630> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
got the new magnets that stick it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
got the new magnets that stick it
together<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.860> gives<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
together like that so it gives it a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.680 
together like that so it gives it a
little<00:02:23.520> bit<00:02:23.670> more<00:02:23.850> stability<00:02:24.090> when<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
little bit more stability when you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630 
little bit more stability when you
combine<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> kickstand<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.340> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
combine it with the kickstand so it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.920 
combine it with the kickstand so it's
not<00:02:26.760> sort<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.270> something<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:27.750> on

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
not sort of just something around on

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.230 
not sort of just something around on
your<00:02:28.020> lap<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.410> anything<00:02:28.710> new<00:02:29.670> color<00:02:29.880> options

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
your lap or anything new color options

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.910 
your lap or anything new color options
this<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.660> orange<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.560> there's<00:02:31.830> gonna

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
this is the orange one and there's gonna

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.500 
this is the orange one and there's gonna
be<00:02:32.010> red<00:02:32.310> blue<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.360> also<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.320> think<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:35.510> cyan

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
be red blue and also I think a cyan

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.450 
be red blue and also I think a cyan
version<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.980> at<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> same<00:02:38.250> time

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
version as well and at the same time

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.640 
version as well and at the same time
they<00:02:38.700> also<00:02:38.850> added<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.450> pen<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> surface

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
they also added a pen for the surface

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.620 
they also added a pen for the surface
free<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.100> now<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.820> isn't<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.330> doesn't

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
free and now this isn't this doesn't

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270 
free and now this isn't this doesn't
come<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.140> surface<00:02:43.470> free<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.160> is

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
come with the surface free this is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.210 
come with the surface free this is
separate<00:02:44.550> accessory<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.750> draw<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.220> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
separate accessory you can draw on just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.280 
separate accessory you can draw on just
as<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.430> read<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.820> surface<00:02:48.060> pro<00:02:48.240> free<00:02:48.480> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
as you read on the surface pro free and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.930 
as you read on the surface pro free and
you<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.860> much<00:02:50.070> much<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.640> colors

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you can get much much in colors

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.640 
you can get much much in colors
depending<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.720> type<00:02:51.930> cover<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.320> go<00:02:52.440> for

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
depending on what type cover you go for

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.050 
depending on what type cover you go for
its<00:02:52.890> overall<00:02:53.190> you're<00:02:53.370> getting<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> surface

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
its overall you're getting a surface

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.030 
its overall you're getting a surface
free<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.200> obviously<00:02:55.560> cheaper<00:02:55.740> than<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
free which is obviously cheaper than the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.530 
free which is obviously cheaper than the
surface<00:02:56.220> pro<00:02:56.520> free<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.000> one's<00:02:57.180> coming<00:02:57.390> in

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
surface pro free so this one's coming in

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.350 
surface pro free so this one's coming in
at<00:02:57.690> $4.99<00:02:58.410> without<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> cover<00:02:59.100> and<00:03:00.060> without

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
at $4.99 without the cover and without

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.930 
at $4.99 without the cover and without
the<00:03:00.480> pen<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.960> sort<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> impressions<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.880> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
the pen and sort of impressions it's a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.210 
the pen and sort of impressions it's a
lot<00:03:03.090> lighter<00:03:03.330> than<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> surface<00:03:04.710> pro<00:03:05.010> free

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
lot lighter than the surface pro free

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.460 
lot lighter than the surface pro free
and<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.700> surface<00:03:06.060> 2<00:03:06.270> before<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.960> so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and the surface 2 before it and so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.530 
and the surface 2 before it and so
you're<00:03:07.560> getting<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.830> cheaper<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> machine

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
you're getting a cheaper like a machine

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.230 
you're getting a cheaper like a machine
that's<00:03:09.960> are<00:03:10.230> going<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> run<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.740> your<00:03:11.010> apps

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
that's are going to run all your apps

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.660 
that's are going to run all your apps
instead<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> windows<00:03:12.750> RT<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.370> comes

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
instead of the windows RT so that comes

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.570 
instead of the windows RT so that comes
in<00:03:14.850> at<00:03:15.090> full<00:03:15.300> 99<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.530> keyboard<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.100> the
