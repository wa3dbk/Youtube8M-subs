hi<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> sandy<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> just<00:00:01.680> wanted<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.010> talk

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hi this is sandy I just wanted to talk

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.730 
hi this is sandy I just wanted to talk
briefly<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:03.049> the<00:00:04.049> way<00:00:04.170> pieces<00:00:04.560> fit

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
briefly about the way pieces fit

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.280 
briefly about the way pieces fit
together<00:00:04.890> with<00:00:05.549> stained<00:00:05.910> glass<00:00:06.049> I've<00:00:07.049> been<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
together with stained glass I've been a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.169 
together with stained glass I've been a
professional<00:00:07.680> stained<00:00:08.130> glass<00:00:08.309> artist<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.820> 15

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
professional stained glass artist for 15

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.400 
professional stained glass artist for 15
years<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:09.900> thing<00:00:10.080> I've<00:00:10.230> noticed

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
years now and one thing I've noticed

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.789 
years now and one thing I've noticed
with<00:00:10.889> beginning<00:00:11.730> students<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:13.259> you

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
with beginning students is that you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.950 
with beginning students is that you
usually<00:00:14.009> stress<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.719> gaps

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
usually stress out about the gaps

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.230 
usually stress out about the gaps
between<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.470> pieces<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.160> actually<00:00:17.910> if<00:00:18.090> you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
between your pieces and actually if you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.849 
between your pieces and actually if you
create<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:18.750> pattern<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.680> use

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
create your pattern right and you use

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.099 
create your pattern right and you use
your<00:00:19.890> foil<00:00:20.310> shears<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.180> should<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
your foil shears you should have about a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
your foil shears you should have about a
sixteenth<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.920> inch<00:00:23.039> gap<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.789> between<00:00:24.060> each

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
sixteenth of an inch gap in between each

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.349 
sixteenth of an inch gap in between each
piece<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> way<00:00:25.410> around<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.970> good

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
piece all the way around and that's good

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.939 
piece all the way around and that's good
because<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.900> happens<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.800> go<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
because what happens is when you go to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
because what happens is when you go to
solder<00:00:29.250> these<00:00:29.490> together<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.119> allows<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
solder these together it allows the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
solder these together it allows the
solder<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.309> between<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> two

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
solder to get down in between your two

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
solder to get down in between your two
pieces<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:34.050> creates<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pieces and it actually creates a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.370 
pieces and it actually creates a
stronger<00:00:35.100> panel<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.989> here

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
stronger panel for you you can see here

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
stronger panel for you you can see here
if<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.460> two<00:00:38.670> pieces<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:39.180> sitting

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
if if you your two pieces are sitting

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
if if you your two pieces are sitting
together<00:00:39.690> side<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.200> side<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.860> no<00:00:41.070> gap<00:00:41.309> in

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
together side by side with no gap in

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
together side by side with no gap in
there<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> go<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> solder<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
there when you go to solder it the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.779 
there when you go to solder it the
sutter<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.530> nowhere<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:43.980> except<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
sutter has nowhere to go except on the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
sutter has nowhere to go except on the
surface<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> basically

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
surface and so it's going to basically

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.630 
surface and so it's going to basically
be<00:00:47.160> floating<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.649> just<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> what

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
be floating on there just like that what

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
be floating on there just like that what
you<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.770> sixteenth<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.010> inch

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you want is that sixteenth of an inch

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.790 
you want is that sixteenth of an inch
gap<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.879> between<00:00:54.059> each<00:00:54.480> piece<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gap in between each piece is it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
gap in between each piece is it's
actually<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> create<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> cobweb<00:00:57.180> effect

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
actually going to create a cobweb effect

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.420 
actually going to create a cobweb effect
so<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> solder<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> first<00:00:59.250> thing

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so when you go to solder the first thing

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
so when you go to solder the first thing
that<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> happen<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.050> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that it's going to happen is it's going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
that it's going to happen is it's going
to<00:01:01.260> fill<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.859> gap<00:01:01.920> between<00:01:02.340> each<00:01:02.730> piece

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to fill in this gap between each piece

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.329 
to fill in this gap between each piece
and<00:01:03.480> when<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> finish<00:01:04.530> solder<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.159> you'll

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and when you finish solder then you'll

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
and when you finish solder then you'll
get<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> nice<00:01:05.700> round<00:01:06.150> bead<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:07.260> going

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
get a nice round bead and that's going

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.920 
get a nice round bead and that's going
to<00:01:07.500> add<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.130> strength<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.479> panel

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to add a lot of strength to your panel

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
to add a lot of strength to your panel
so<00:01:10.460> using<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.640> foil<00:01:12.299> shears<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.770> allows<00:01:14.490> in

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so using your foil shears it allows in

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880 
so using your foil shears it allows in
compensates<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> space<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> foil

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
compensates for the space for the foil

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
compensates for the space for the foil
plus<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.610> gives<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.060> extra<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.810> space

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
plus it gives that extra little space

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
plus it gives that extra little space
for<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.530> solder<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.100> sit<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:20.460> into<00:01:20.939> now

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
for that solder to sit down into now

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.140 
for that solder to sit down into now
when<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.060> soldering<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.729> couple<00:01:26.729> things<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
when I'm soldering is a couple things I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
when I'm soldering is a couple things I
like<00:01:27.330> using<00:01:27.689> gel<00:01:27.900> flux<00:01:28.200> versus<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.860> liquid<00:01:29.340> flux

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
like using gel flux versus a liquid flux

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
like using gel flux versus a liquid flux
the<00:01:30.299> gel<00:01:30.540> flux<00:01:30.840> doesn't<00:01:31.200> seem<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> sputter<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the gel flux doesn't seem to sputter and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
the gel flux doesn't seem to sputter and
smoke<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.640> splatter<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
smoke and splatter and it's kind of a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
smoke and splatter and it's kind of a
greasy<00:01:35.009> substance<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.329> gel<00:01:36.540> flux

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
greasy substance and the gel flux

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960 
greasy substance and the gel flux
doesn't<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.280> need<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
doesn't do that you don't need much I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.899 
doesn't do that you don't need much I
put<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> brush<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
put it on with a brush and just just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
put it on with a brush and just just
enough<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> surface<00:01:42.750> wet<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.409> also<00:01:44.159> use

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
enough to get the surface wet I also use

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
enough to get the surface wet I also use
two<00:01:44.670> types<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.060> solder<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> use<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> 50/50<00:01:46.170> solder

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
two types of solder I use a 50/50 solder

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
two types of solder I use a 50/50 solder
and<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> 60/40<00:01:47.280> solder<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.210> reason<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and a 60/40 solder the reason for the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.210 
and a 60/40 solder the reason for the
two<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> 50/50<00:01:51.149> solder<00:01:51.420> takes<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.439> lot

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
two are that a 50/50 solder takes a lot

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.480 
two are that a 50/50 solder takes a lot
hotter<00:01:53.460> temperature<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:55.020> melt<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.310> see

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
hotter temperature to melt you can see

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
hotter temperature to melt you can see
the<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.540> doesn't<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:57.930> matter<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.530> brand

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the it doesn't really matter what brand

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.399 
the it doesn't really matter what brand
but<00:01:59.490> 50/50<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.170> little

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but 50/50 I want to use it's a little

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
but 50/50 I want to use it's a little
lower<00:02:01.560> price<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:02.670> filling<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
lower price and so when I'm filling the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.899 
lower price and so when I'm filling the
gaps<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.689> using<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.380> lower<00:02:04.950> price<00:02:05.250> solder<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
gaps I'm using a lower price solder and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.719 
gaps I'm using a lower price solder and
it's<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.180> stronger<00:02:06.600> solder<00:02:07.459> takes<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.550> hotter

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's a stronger solder takes a hotter

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's a stronger solder takes a hotter
temperature<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> melt<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> even<00:02:10.379> though<00:02:10.470> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
temperature to melt it even though I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.930 
temperature to melt it even though I
don't<00:02:10.619> change<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> temperature<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.790> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
don't change the temperature on my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.640 
don't change the temperature on my
temperature<00:02:12.390> controller

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
temperature controller

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
temperature controller
it<00:02:13.890> gives<00:02:14.400> me<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> flat<00:02:14.909> surface<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.659> work<00:02:16.079> on<00:02:16.319> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
it gives me a flat surface to work on so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440 
it gives me a flat surface to work on so
that<00:02:16.860> when<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> go<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.459> finish<00:02:17.939> solder<00:02:18.239> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that when I go back to finish solder it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
that when I go back to finish solder it
and<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> want<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.840> get<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.110> nice<00:02:19.319> round<00:02:19.799> bead

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and I want to get that nice round bead

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.179 
and I want to get that nice round bead
on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> top<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.959> 60/40<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.799> going<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
on the top of it the 60/40 is going to

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.699 
on the top of it the 60/40 is going to
actually<00:02:23.700> sit<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.150> top<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.659> 50/50<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
actually sit on top of the 50/50 the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.830 
actually sit on top of the 50/50 the
50/50<00:02:26.340> s<00:02:26.400> job<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.939> fill<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.150> gaps<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.659> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
50/50 s job is to fill the gaps in to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.229 
50/50 s job is to fill the gaps in to
strengthen<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.769> panel<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.280> 60/40<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.090> to

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
strengthen the panel the 60/40 is to

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.039 
strengthen the panel the 60/40 is to
make<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.510> look<00:02:30.659> good

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
make it look good

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.559 
make it look good
so<00:02:31.409> I<00:02:31.739> do<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.189> four<00:02:32.489> step<00:02:32.730> process<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.269> I'll

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
so I do a four step process and I'll

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.500 
so I do a four step process and I'll
show<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.049> here<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.150> also<00:02:36.299> go

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
show it here for you and you can also go

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.210 
show it here for you and you can also go
to<00:02:36.569> our<00:02:36.659> website<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.409> I'll<00:02:37.620> try<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.069> this

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to our website and I'll try to get this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.390 
to our website and I'll try to get this
typed<00:02:39.000> up<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.359> put<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.049> there<00:02:40.290> first<00:02:41.189> off

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
typed up and put out there first off

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.670 
typed up and put out there first off
I'll<00:02:41.609> take<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.359> panel<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.989> I'll<00:02:43.079> place<00:02:43.470> all

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
I'll take my panel and I'll place all

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.949 
I'll take my panel and I'll place all
the<00:02:43.799> pieces<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.299> sure<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.659> there's<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
the pieces and make sure that there's a

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.720 
the pieces and make sure that there's a
sixteenth<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.620> an<00:02:46.739> inch<00:02:46.829> all<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.129> way<00:02:47.340> around

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
sixteenth of an inch all the way around

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.449 
sixteenth of an inch all the way around
and<00:02:48.030> then<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.530> first<00:02:49.739> step<00:02:49.950> I'll<00:02:50.069> do<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.340> I'll

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and then the first step I'll do is I'll

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.149 
and then the first step I'll do is I'll
flat<00:02:50.700> solder<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> front<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.659> a<00:02:51.690> 50/50<00:02:52.440> I'll

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
flat solder the front with a 50/50 I'll

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.420 
flat solder the front with a 50/50 I'll
flip<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.150> over<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.780> I'll<00:02:55.230> flat<00:02:55.769> solder<00:02:56.159> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
flip it over and I'll flat solder the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.339 
flip it over and I'll flat solder the
back<00:02:56.609> with<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.940> 50/50<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:57.989> going<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
back with the 50/50 and that's going to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.009 
back with the 50/50 and that's going to
really<00:02:58.680> add<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.670> strength<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.269> rigidity<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
really add the strength and rigidity to

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.140 
really add the strength and rigidity to
the<00:03:01.139> panel<00:03:01.530> then<00:03:02.189> I'll<00:03:02.340> finish<00:03:02.579> solder<00:03:02.939> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the panel then I'll finish solder the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.869 
the panel then I'll finish solder the
back<00:03:03.329> with<00:03:03.569> 60/40<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.549> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> be

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
back with 60/40 and this is going to be

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.460 
back with 60/40 and this is going to be
the<00:03:06.030> process<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.900> all<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> air<00:03:07.439> bubbles

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the process that all the air bubbles

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.949 
the process that all the air bubbles
escape<00:03:07.920> from<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.639> in-between<00:03:09.359> that's<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
escape from the in-between that's the

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.050 
escape from the in-between that's the
two<00:03:10.139> seams<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.189> it's<00:03:11.340> going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.519> take<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.879> most

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
two seams so it's going to take the most

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.339 
two seams so it's going to take the most
amount<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.450> time<00:03:12.510> because<00:03:13.019> you're<00:03:13.200> going<00:03:13.290> to

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
amount of time because you're going to

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.379 
amount of time because you're going to
constantly<00:03:13.920> find<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.459> you're<00:03:14.790> you're

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
constantly find that you're you're

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.869 
constantly find that you're you're
trying<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.840> fill<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:16.859> air<00:03:17.159> bubbles<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.669> things

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
trying to fill in air bubbles and things

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.830 
trying to fill in air bubbles and things
like<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:19.639> in<00:03:20.639> plus<00:03:21.090> if<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.389> miss<00:03:21.569> an<00:03:21.690> air

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
like that and in plus if you miss an air

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.629 
like that and in plus if you miss an air
bubble<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> back<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.980> then<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
bubble it's on the back and then the

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.150 
bubble it's on the back and then the
final<00:03:24.000> step<00:03:24.030> step<00:03:24.599> number<00:03:24.629> four<00:03:25.079> is<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.440> flip

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
final step step number four is I flip

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.580 
final step step number four is I flip
and<00:03:26.400> finish<00:03:26.760> over<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.060> front<00:03:27.629> with<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> 60/40

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
and finish over the front with the 60/40

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.039 
and finish over the front with the 60/40
now<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.190> reason<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.699> two<00:03:29.909> like<00:03:30.599> I<00:03:30.720> said<00:03:30.930> it

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
now the reason the two like I said it

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.869 
now the reason the two like I said it
takes<00:03:31.199> a<00:03:31.319> hotter<00:03:31.470> temperature<00:03:31.949> for<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.220> 50-50

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
takes a hotter temperature for the 50-50

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.490 
takes a hotter temperature for the 50-50
and<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:33.690> going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> give<00:03:34.019> me<00:03:34.169> a<00:03:34.199> nice

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and so it's going to give me a nice

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.759 
and so it's going to give me a nice
surface<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.519> lay<00:03:35.730> down<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:36.840> my<00:03:37.019> 60/40

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
surface to lay down on to with my 60/40

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.309 
surface to lay down on to with my 60/40
if<00:03:37.919> I<00:03:38.370> only<00:03:38.579> use<00:03:38.940> 60/40<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.019> I'm<00:03:40.139> going<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
if I only use 60/40 then I'm going to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.899 
if I only use 60/40 then I'm going to
constantly<00:03:40.919> struggle<00:03:41.370> with<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.639> heat

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
constantly struggle with the heat

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.059 
constantly struggle with the heat
wanting<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.510> drip<00:03:42.930> through<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.440> panel<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:43.979> if

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
wanting to drip through the panel so if

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.189 
wanting to drip through the panel so if
you've<00:03:44.190> had<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.549> problem<00:03:44.959> chances<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.109> if

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
you switch and start using a 50/50 and a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.210 
you switch and start using a 50/50 and a
60/40<00:03:48.780> combination<00:03:49.409> you're<00:03:49.889> not<00:03:50.040> going<00:03:50.159> to

60/40 combination you're not going to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.339 
60/40 combination you're not going to
have<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.940> melt<00:03:51.269> through<00:03:51.599> happening
