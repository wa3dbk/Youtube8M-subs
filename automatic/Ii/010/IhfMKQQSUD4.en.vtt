00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
camp is great experience but also it's a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.300

i<00:01:44.200> opening<00:01:44.979> experience<00:01:45.460> as<00:01:45.610> well<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:47.190> think<00:01:48.190> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
i opening experience as well I think the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.880 
i opening experience as well I think the
mental<00:01:48.490> aspect<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:50.080> know<00:01:50.410> people<00:01:50.619> talk

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
mental aspect of it you know people talk

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.830 
mental aspect of it you know people talk
about<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.399> know<00:01:51.509> conditioning<00:01:52.509> they<00:01:52.660> talk

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
about you know conditioning they talk

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.389 
about you know conditioning they talk
about<00:01:52.990> strength<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.040> they<00:01:54.130> don't<00:01:54.280> ever

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
about strength but they don't ever

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.609 
about strength but they don't ever
really<00:01:54.940> talk<00:01:55.390> about<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.690> mental<00:01:55.990> aspect<00:01:56.080> then

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
really talk about the mental aspect then

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.560 
really talk about the mental aspect then
I<00:01:56.860> think<00:01:57.460> if<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:57.940> believe<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.300> you're<00:01:58.540> a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
I think if you believe that you're a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.850 
I think if you believe that you're a
good<00:01:58.750> goalie<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.530> know<00:01:59.649> you<00:01:59.710> have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
good goalie and you know you have

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.469 
good goalie and you know you have
confidence<00:02:00.160> in<00:02:00.430> yourself<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:00.820> makes<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.240> big

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
confidence in yourself that makes a big

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.460 
confidence in yourself that makes a big
difference<00:02:02.310> no<00:02:03.310> big<00:02:03.759> story<00:02:04.240> as<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.720> how<00:02:04.869> Taylor

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
difference no big story as to how Taylor

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.669 
difference no big story as to how Taylor
decided<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.100> be<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> goalie<00:02:06.610> she<00:02:07.570> was<00:02:07.750> 10<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.649> a
