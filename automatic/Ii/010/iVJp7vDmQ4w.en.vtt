00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.339

 We bring you on Mondays, not for those who do not 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.910
 you know on Mondays we promote 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.370
 to people in the channel and other than that 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.559
 we bring double video to the channel if we upload 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.839
 two videos one this you will be watching 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.839
 I suppose that around 12 in the morning 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.059
 and another one that I'll upload kids at eight and 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.769
 half nine in the afternoon if not what 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.289
 you knew so well today you have two videos 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.309
 one now and one in the afternoon and good 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.470
 what you are seeing in the background 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.450
 kids 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.710
 is a nuclear cocos pp and ask them 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.760
 many who still do not know who 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 boats pps 11 individuals and they could only 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 so he took out the first nuclear triple 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 Spanish and they hunted him that was 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 sought the first triple and after 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.980
 I think these kids now have 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.480
 more than 40 nuclear triples and good not 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.520
 I'm going to comment on anything about that 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.860
 but good here in my friend to the bottom that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.590
 He told me that he wanted to promote it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 this and I promoted it and well 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.040
 he took out a nuclear playing against him 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 with the flap on top, look, it's a lot 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.530
 it is a very closed weapon but that is a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 hike to kill less than a 94 in my 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.750
 opinion although a slight one is yes that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.660
 you have many bullets and all that but with 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.400
 one of 94 always goes a lot more chet and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.560
 he takes out a nuclear against farc os pp 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
 and so good has much merit this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.340
 departure even if it is a nuclear one that does not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.540
 is extremely fast for kids 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.400
 well you have to understand that playing 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.050
 against good people that many of you complain about 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.300
 that many compression against people 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.550
 manca and good when against good people 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.229
 if they are nuclear and so on but good not 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.900
 fast things come out entertaining 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.490
 frantic who like to see you 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.670
 and for example I have a nuclear 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.530
 when against bolt that calls them back 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.390
 of the flowers the boy who has the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.580
 record of casualties to weapon in black ops 2 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 I have a nuclear against him for 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.290
 a lot and well, it has not gone up because 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.550
 for certain reasons it has not gone up but not 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.930
 today we are not here for 18 now 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.730

 gulf three very entertaining examples and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.530
 always departures has nuclear triples 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.860
 with very rare weapons as the asm ere 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.340
 has fast nuclear companies have 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.840

 serious that we go for the goal 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.700
 than to take a game to zero in game of 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.680
 weapons and good if you are right in certain 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.599
 part since the objective of the series 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.310
 yes no but good kids more than anything 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.810
 we also told each other when we told you 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.549
 that we are going to bring the series that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 mainly it was also to attract 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.810
 several to the channel is of the likes 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.340

 to bring more to play and we will bring more 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.360
 likes in other game modes in others 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.709
 games to vary a bit also the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.569
 theme of the LEDs in the channel that symbol 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.910
 we come up from the second video you know it or 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.220
 be your fireplace today you will have a 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.989
 episode of the road show chuck norris and 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.640
 good for that why you tell us that we 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.319
 more seriously and yes, but still 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.700
 kids the goal of almonds and 10 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.560
 on January 3, so we get a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.900
 game that is a 20 3 taking a streak 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.390
 of more than 10 games 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.730
 and on top of doing something epic or something 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.069
 very funny in the live we are going to bring 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.650
 equally although we did not start from 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.200
 zero kids because if you realize 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.879
 is if we enter a game to play more 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.650
 if they kill us and the first one we will have 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.540
 to leave no longer because the episode no longer 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.370
 serves and created the game so good you 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.889
 you're here to finish it and hang out 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.660
 but if you want to bring a job to 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.210
 channel well we have to go out and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.440
 now if we bring very epic games yes 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.509
 I think that this afternoon you will like it 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.270
 so much so good you have an appointment in 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.949
 the channel for eight thirty I went up 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.750
 in fact now we get to 200 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.310
 laws for that hour because well I tell you 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 that I go and I will not be home and 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.880
 I will be very busy I have to go to the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.710
 driving school we say if you do not I'm 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.850
 taking the driver's license but good 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.500
 I'm here, we'll be lost 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.540
 I hope you've clarified what 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.700
 from the noris 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.040
 the last thing you say you can not 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.440
 reproach anything at the bottom that does not kill 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.630
 false pp during the nuclear good 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.150
 because they kill him I do not know if five or six 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.380
 times and in addition there is another kid very good 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.420
 in the game that one I'm not going to 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.640
 name because I fall for fucking mother and 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.780
 well that farc os pp tell you that there are in 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.820
 account is that I had up to 10 of 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.300
 proportion I think it has more than 2,000 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.740
 nucleus or I think there is no person 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.660
 Spanish that has played more to lula 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.310
 is that he so good kids 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.510
 and I hope you go through the channel 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.670
 iphone to reach its thousand 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.110
 subscribers that I want it to reach and 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.760
 good with nothing more to say kids 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.040
 appointment at eight thirty on the channel as well 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.830
 if we reach 200 readers now and 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.420
 tomorrow you will have a new series that I 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.680
 will like kids so nothing if not 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.680
 more than saying to play to pay
