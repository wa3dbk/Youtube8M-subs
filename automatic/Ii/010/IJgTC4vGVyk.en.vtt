00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.720
 and there, guys, I always go club, I'm 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.610
 leymah and today I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 Simplified version of thinking music 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.160
 in you of the pepper the introduction 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.160
 We'll use these chords from the greatest 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:38.740
 domino with seventh if better with seventh 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 of the miniature sibemol 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.910
 the smaller is bigger and only bigger 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.020
 look that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.660
 we will use a rhythm just to play 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:30.820
 whole song I'll play once and 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:32.860
 then teach what you do as a victim and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020
 three parts in the first part people 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.680
 mounts the doha major agreement and plays two 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 times down 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.210
 In the second part we set up the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.470
 seven and we played two up 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 none down 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.780
 the third part still of the minor with 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 seventh we play up and down 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.430
 down and up 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.460
 the three parts together 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.910
 the rhythm will be the same for the song 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.200
 what will vary is the time of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.880
 change the chords 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.070
 Sometimes we 'll change the team. 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.990
 whole in just one chord in other chords 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.360
 changes already runs in the middle of the same video 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.580
 I just showed off the biggest domino with 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 seat in the first part we will use 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:45.880
 the following only major chords is larger 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:49.210
 nor less if smaller with seventh of the largest 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.210
 in there minor 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.160
 the rhythm even if we or the people 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.000
 will always agree on the second 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.840
 part of the rhythm 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.400
 Look, it's only in the sites, it's yours. 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.400
 Friend but what will it be? 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.420
 flower love 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.860
 sometimes I get caught on the wrong day 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.860
 although she is not in love 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:27.260
 I only will soon pass on the second 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:34.220
 of the agreements are the most dominoes with 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:42.970
 seventh only with low in itself B flat 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 the smaller the smaller the larger 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.250
 It stays that way but when the phone rings 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.069
 It will be you, what are you doing? 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.120
 The noise of doing this gets very 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:02.959
 call me, what else do you need to look for? 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.959
 I'm but I 'm not avoided. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.390
 the chords of the chorus are those greater C 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.390
 it's bigger 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:24.470
 if smaller with seventh largest minor minor only 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.880
 bigger 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.880
 and the minor with seven 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.740
 The refrain stays that way because I only live 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.729
 thingking on you 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.099
 unintentionally you do not know 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:50.320
 Head I just saw the color of the ball 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:53.470
 dream imagining two months 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:58.540
 be an impossible dream maylson tenniel 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.120
 will I pray so much in prayer that the 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.840
 doors of your heart 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.639
 if at the beginning of conquer 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.990
 but that the will of God be done 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.040
 if he wants then no matter where I 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.040
 I'll have 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.660
 then the chorus has a solid to do. 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:32.590
 We 're going to use these chords alone. 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:41.670
 bigger and bigger and smaller if smaller with 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:44.790
 seventh largest and smallest with seven thousand 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.790
 stays like this 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.650
 after the solo the song repeats the whole and 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.390
 at the very end to end we do 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.580
 same chord sequence from the base of the 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.050
 solo to watch more videos and 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.000
 learning the songs, just enter the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.470
 cycle any doubt leave a 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.790
 beauty comment here 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.790
 It's good and until the next
