that custom bed in our market we

the Ford Rangers have been discontinued
so<00:03:32.480> we've<00:03:32.630> already<00:03:32.840> made<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.230> switch<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.980> at

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
so we've already made the switch and at

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.950 
so we've already made the switch and at
this<00:03:34.280> point<00:03:34.550> we're<00:03:34.790> now<00:03:35.120> building<00:03:35.360> out<00:03:35.690> just

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
this point we're now building out just

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.170 
this point we're now building out just
f-150s<00:03:36.800> with<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.160> custom<00:03:37.550> beds<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:37.940> back

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
f-150s with the custom beds on the back

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.060 
f-150s with the custom beds on the back
so<00:03:38.570> since<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.320> Ranger<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.980> to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
so since the Ranger is going to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.740 
so since the Ranger is going to
eventually<00:03:40.490> end<00:03:40.520> we<00:03:41.000> always<00:03:41.150> bought<00:03:41.480> use

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
eventually end we always bought use

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.870 
eventually end we always bought use
Ranger's<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.800> figured<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.310> might<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.550> well<00:03:43.730> go

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
Ranger's we figured we might as well go

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.250 
Ranger's we figured we might as well go
ahead<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.120> make<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.390> switch<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.080> we're

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
ahead and make the switch and so we're

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.199 
ahead and make the switch and so we're
now<00:03:45.380> running<00:03:45.590> f-150s<00:03:46.520> for<00:03:46.790> our<00:03:46.910> small

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
now running f-150s for our small

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.900 
now running f-150s for our small
residential<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:47.959> well<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:49.070> again<00:03:49.459> custom

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
residential as well with again custom

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.010 
residential as well with again custom
beds<00:03:50.120> on<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.360> back<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:52.430> do<00:03:52.610> pull<00:03:52.880> trailers<00:03:53.420> but

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
beds on the back we do pull trailers but

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.340 
beds on the back we do pull trailers but
only<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.980> Bush<00:03:55.670> trimming<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.360> if<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
only for Bush trimming so if you you

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.930 
only for Bush trimming so if you you
might<00:03:57.530> call<00:03:57.740> it<00:03:57.830> some<00:03:58.040> enhancement<00:03:58.610> work<00:03:58.730> so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
might call it some enhancement work so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.870 
might call it some enhancement work so
if<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.150> doing<00:03:59.270> flowers<00:04:00.020> or<00:04:00.530> sod<00:04:00.830> or<00:04:01.250> we're

doing bush trimming flowerbed cleanups
which<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:05.690> often<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.410> with<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.709> bush<00:04:06.890> trimming

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280

MPR<00:04:43.340> better<00:04:43.550> than<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.910> diesel<00:04:44.090> because<00:04:44.870> we

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
MPR better than the diesel because we

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.170 
MPR better than the diesel because we
don't<00:04:45.170> drive<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.740> ridiculous<00:04:46.520> number<00:04:46.700> of<00:04:46.940> miles

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
don't drive a ridiculous number of miles

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.120 
don't drive a ridiculous number of miles
because<00:04:47.510> we<00:04:47.870> have<00:04:47.990> pretty<00:04:48.230> tight<00:04:48.440> density<00:04:48.950> and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
because we have pretty tight density and

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.180 
because we have pretty tight density and
so<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.720> setups<00:04:51.170> worked<00:04:51.410> out<00:04:51.560> nicely<00:04:51.800> we're

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
so that setups worked out nicely we're

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.090 
so that setups worked out nicely we're
pleased<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.670> it<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.500> anytime<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.860> run<00:04:55.070> a

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100
