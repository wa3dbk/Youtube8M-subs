00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.020 

and<00:00:43.610> number<00:00:43.850> five<00:00:44.090> code<00:00:44.660> yes<00:00:45.700> okay<00:00:46.700> I<00:00:46.730> can't

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.820 
and number five code yes okay I can't
really<00:00:47.150> say<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:47.480> Code<00:00:47.870> Geass<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.380> massively

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
really say that Code Geass is massively

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.740 
really say that Code Geass is massively
overrated<00:00:49.220> because<00:00:49.790> I'd<00:00:49.970> actually<00:00:50.330> did<00:00:50.540> quite

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
overrated because I'd actually did quite

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.450 
overrated because I'd actually did quite
enjoy<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.320> show<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.890> only<00:00:52.010> reason<00:00:52.340> why

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
enjoy the show but the only reason why

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.370 
enjoy the show but the only reason why
it's<00:00:52.640> honest<00:00:52.940> list<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.330> because<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.930> pacing

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's honest list is because the pacing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.590 
it's honest list is because the pacing
for<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.620> show<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.160> really<00:00:55.550> fast<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.510> really

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
for the show is really fast and really

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.320 
for the show is really fast and really
rushed<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.040> pacing<00:00:58.430> was<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.730> fast<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.180> when

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
rushed the pacing was so fast that when

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.790 
rushed the pacing was so fast that when
I<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.540> first<00:00:59.690> watching<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.230> show<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.590> thought

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
I was first watching the show I thought

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.830 
I was first watching the show I thought
I<00:01:00.860> was<00:01:01.070> watching<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.580> heavily<00:01:02.000> edited<00:01:02.180> version

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
I was watching a heavily edited version

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840 
I was watching a heavily edited version
but<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.260> wasn't<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.860> was<00:01:04.190> watching<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.729> original

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
but I wasn't I was watching the original

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.330 
but I wasn't I was watching the original
version<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.690> it<00:01:06.080> was<00:01:06.229> weird<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.950> pacing<00:01:07.310> was

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
version and it was weird the pacing was

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.859 
version and it was weird the pacing was
so<00:01:07.700> fast<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.270> first<00:01:08.479> couple<00:01:08.810> episodes

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
so fast in the first couple episodes

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.350 
so fast in the first couple episodes
that<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:09.920> much<00:01:10.130> stuff<00:01:10.340> was<00:01:10.550> happening<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:11.090> once

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
that so much stuff was happening at once

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.969 
that so much stuff was happening at once
it<00:01:11.600> didn't<00:01:11.900> give<00:01:12.020> me<00:01:12.140> enough<00:01:12.170> time<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.619> care

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
it didn't give me enough time to care

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.950 
it didn't give me enough time to care
about<00:01:13.070> any<00:01:13.400> of<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.729> granted<00:01:14.300> I<00:01:14.390> did<00:01:14.630> get<00:01:14.780> used

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
about any of it granted I did get used

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.749 
about any of it granted I did get used
to<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.200> after<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.440> while<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.190> was<00:01:16.340> really

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
to it after a while but it was really

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.490 
to it after a while but it was really
weird<00:01:16.970> watching<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.780> first<00:01:18.170> couple<00:01:18.440> episodes

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
weird watching the first couple episodes

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.130 
weird watching the first couple episodes
of<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.040> show<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:20.150> was<00:01:20.270> really<00:01:20.540> fast<00:01:20.780> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
of the show it was really fast and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.840 
of the show it was really fast and
really<00:01:21.290> rushed<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:21.920> was<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.729> was

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
really rushed and it was it was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.310 
really rushed and it was it was
confusing<00:01:23.270> but<00:01:23.660> even<00:01:23.869> though<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> show's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
confusing but even though the show's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.469 
confusing but even though the show's
pacing<00:01:24.800> is<00:01:24.920> really<00:01:25.250> fast<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.759> still<00:01:26.000> did<00:01:26.240> enjoy

the show quite a lot and yeah that's
about<00:01:30.410> it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
good at all the writing is bad the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330 
good at all the writing is bad the
characters<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:13.080> really<00:03:13.380> annoying<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.220> they

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
characters are really annoying and they

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.850 
characters are really annoying and they
reuse<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> lot<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.480> animation<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.320> don't<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:16.709> why

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
so many people like the show I guess

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.170 
so many people like the show I guess
it's<00:03:19.080> because<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.860> nostalgia<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.640> guess<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
it's because of nostalgia I guess I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.610 
it's because of nostalgia I guess I
don't<00:03:21.390> know<00:03:21.570> maybe<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:22.050> just<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.410> my<00:03:22.590> thing

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
don't know maybe it's just not my thing
