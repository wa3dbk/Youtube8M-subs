00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.199
 i 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.199
 ah 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello this week no chance I would like 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.539
 introduce them the new single touch that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 is what we have here before us as 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.160
 we see is an electronic reader of 6 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.020
 inches with electronic ink and 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.600
 the truth is that it is very light we have 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.880
 here four physical buttons that are going 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.250
 to allow forward and backward 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.390
 page then here we have the button 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.530
 unlocking the device and that too 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.300
 will allow us to access the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.000
 different director options 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.629
 electronic then back we have the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.940
 button on and off and good 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.920
 here the micro sd input that is going to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.780
 allow to increase the memory of the reader 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.290
 electronic 2 gigabytes which is what 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.380
 comes by default to 32 gigs through 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.090
 using a micro sd card 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.640
 and finally the last entry that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.010
 we have is the usb entry that is going 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.650
 to allow both to recharge the reader 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.320
 electronic how to connect to 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.410
 computer through usb we will be able to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.410
 pass computer books to the nook 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.300
 well what we see on the screen is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.120
 simply the screen saver that 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.860
 they are going to give us they are going to appear 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.850
 different authors to unlock the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.100
 electro the electronic reader 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.760
 we just have to push this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.760
 button 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 and slide the left lock to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 right well what we see now in the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.360
 screen is the start screen of the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 nook 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 and we see here for example the reading out 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.100
 which is the book we are reading 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.330
 currently if we click on the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 cover of the book we access 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.470
 directly to the page where we 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.540
 we were the last time we read the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 book then we also have a section 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.400
 of new read that are the latest books 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.490
 that we downloaded to the reader 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.410
 electronic and then we have here the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.080
 section of what to read nets that are 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.500
 the recommendations that you make at the level 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.320
 they make us then we also have a one 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.970
 shortcut icon 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.780
 that takes us directly to our 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.550
 bookstore well we have one thing that I 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.560
 I like it a lot, we have different 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.380
 ways to visualize all the books that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.160
 we have on the one hand in list mode and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.800
 then in cover mode we can not 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.570
 exchange the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.600
 it's worth something else that's pretty 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.670
 well is that we can do shelves and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.790
 shelves that would be the equivalent to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.340
 different folders then here we have 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.080
 three different bookstores on one side 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.460
 books of antonio books of elena and 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.620
 read rtl if we click on a 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.480
 certain shelf we see the books 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.370
 what's on the shelf of elena bien 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.900
 now we do not have many books but if 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.360
 we had many books if we wanted 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.820
 look for one in particular a very option 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 interesting is the option to search 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.709
 books well if for example we introduce 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.120
 the title of a book or a word that 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.450
 is contained in the title of a book 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 let's look and we have it here 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 they defended since it's worth now we're going to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.940
 look for another one that is the one we were 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.940
 reading 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.000
 well show up here if you tell me come 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.959
 I leave everything of Alberto Espinoza and if 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.760
 we click on this book it opens 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.909
 directly the page that we were 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.909
 reading 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.709
 well the next thing I would like 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.660
 show you is one of the different 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.170
 ways that we have in the nook to pass 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.940
 page well is in this the nook presents 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.740
 advantage over other books 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.660
 electronic since we have three forms 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.950
 different from turning page one side 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.120
 as we mentioned before we can 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.120
 use the physical buttons 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.670
 those on the left or the color of the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.230
 right 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.610
 independently then another option 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.270
 interesting is that if we keep 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.580
 pressed the physical button we go back 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.030
 quickly you see how fast it goes 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.380
 then the second option is to slide the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.810
 finger simply from left to right 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.150
 or from right to left depending on whether 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.200
 we want to turn the page forward or 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.910
 back in this way is how is the 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.890
 that we usually use in telephones 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.110
 mobile or on the tablets and then the 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.600
 last way that I think what else 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.150
 comfortable is just giving a little touch 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 on the edge of the screen 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.280
 when we are reading is pretty little 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.220
 the next thing that I would like to show you 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.320
 is to be primarily directed at those 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510
 people who like to underline and do 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.190
 annotations in the books well in 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.800
 the nook symbol touch we can also 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.660
 do it without any problem by 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.310
 example if we want to underline a 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.120
 certain phrase we simply have 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.910
 to press on the word that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.010
 we want to emphasize and we appear two 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.200
 small indicators that show us the 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.780
 start and end of what we want 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.480
 underline they came back holding down 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.110
 one end and sliding we're going to 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.240
 to be able to select the phrase we want 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.190
 underline this simple once 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.350
 we have selected the phrase that 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.230
 we want to underline we give here to 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.100
 highlight 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.790
 and it stays underlined we can go to another 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.720
 page go back and we will stay 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.480
 underlined 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.090
 good as long as we want if we want 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.430
 erase the underline we just give a 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.820
 little touch and we see here that we can 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.150
 add a note or remove the underline if 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.960
 we give to remove 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.449
 the underline disappears to add a 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.539
 note similarly 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.689
 we select first where we want 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.180
 add the note we give to add 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.740
 annotation and well here we see the 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.289
 keyboard and we can 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.420
 and write 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.990
 simply what we want this is 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.990
 one 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.789
 it is not 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.800
 we got to done and we see here this 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.810
 symbol tells us that we have done here 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.360
 a note 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.730
 in addition to the underlining and the 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.830
 notes another interesting option is 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.200
 the page marks for the brands of 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.000
 page we just have to click on 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.470
 the one at the bottom of the screen 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.050
 where we can observe 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.580
 the number the page number on which 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.950
 we are and the total number of pages that 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.340
 has the book if we click here 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.290
 the page mark option 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.750
 we can use the page mark 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.990
 also to highlight content that we 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.990
 liked it
