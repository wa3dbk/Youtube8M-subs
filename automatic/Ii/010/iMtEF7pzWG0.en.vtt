00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I hate because the first time I tried it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.819 
I hate because the first time I tried it
it<00:01:42.420> feels<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:42.990> gonna<00:01:43.110> snap<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it feels like you're gonna snap it and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.499 
it feels like you're gonna snap it and
it's<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> grip<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it's very hard to get a grip so what I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
it's very hard to get a grip so what I
might<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.110> might<00:01:46.140> buy<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.770> another<00:01:47.040> set

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
might do is I might buy just another set

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
might do is I might buy just another set
of<00:01:47.399> side<00:01:48.329> plates<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
of side plates it's because I think I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
of side plates it's because I think I
was<00:01:49.350> gonna<00:01:49.439> keep<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.890> wiser<00:01:50.070> cuz<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
was gonna keep it is wiser cuz if I just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
was gonna keep it is wiser cuz if I just
off<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> rain<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:52.130> trickles<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
off the rain just trickles off it I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.920 
off the rain just trickles off it I
