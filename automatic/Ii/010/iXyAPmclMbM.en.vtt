00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340

maybe<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.099> that's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> 12<00:00:26.760> inch

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
maybe it's because that's a 12 inch

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.330 
maybe it's because that's a 12 inch
flying<00:00:27.240> saucer<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.320> 12<00:00:28.740> inch<00:00:28.890> silent
