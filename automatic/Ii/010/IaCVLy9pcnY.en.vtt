00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hi everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 make a hazelnut cream at home 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 and super delicious but also very healthy cocoa 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 and there won't be many ingredients 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 pull with only one nations 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
 bit of dark chocolate a bit of cocoa 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 and a goccino of honey 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.220
 let's start with the hazelnut cream 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 the ingredients you will need 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 will be 300 g of losone 40 grams of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 powdered cocoa powder 50 grams of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.090
 dark chocolate 120 grams of honey 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.579
 and 50 grams of oil will almost even serve 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.910
 a goccino of milk and a bit of vanilla 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.039
 then start adjusting the hazelnuts 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.469
 so we can also better remove the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.500
 skin of the hand and we think about it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.230
 in all part of the season we 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 put in a hot oven about 200 degrees 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.510
 for a maximum of ten minutes 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.790
 meanwhile I advise myself during the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.450
 cooking to go a little to turn us over 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 about 57 minutes have passed 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.909
 our hazelnuts are ready to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.330
 believe me so duster as i am 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.330
 still hot and chile inward 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.650
 and we rub them a little so as to 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.830
 remove the skin if then all 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.040
 hazelnuts will not have the skin 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.450
 completely detached does not remember 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 important that most do 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.190
 most of the cuticle is ok 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.380
 she's gone like this is fine now 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 we take our hazelnuts and le 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.190
 put in the blender 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.619
 ok if we move what we have to 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.450
 doing now will create some kind of butter 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.120
 of peanuts so we're going to whisk 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:21.810
 until we see that it has formed 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 just a cream point butter cream 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 a smoothie training is starting 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 for a minute you see who starts a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.579
 we will need to become creamy 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.380
 make it become even smoother then 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.989
 I would say to blend it a couple more 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.810
 minutes 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.989
 ok our butter is ready see how 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.459
 it has become smooth and creamy now 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.560
 we can go all in for the rest 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:54.470
 of the ingredients then we put with the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.470
 cocoa and honey 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.340
 the chocolate 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:17.629
 let's start to blend and add the oil 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.400
 this is cold-pressed seed oil 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.400
 re-use the sunflower one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.299
 and finally we put the milk this is the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.049
 looking for a glass chin I don't know if it is 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:44.180
 I'll put it all depends on the consistency 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.180
 which will then start with a goccino 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:05.030
 and while another little ours 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.610
 cream is almost ready and now I will go 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.310
 just adding the variable no 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.510
 use the liquid extract but if not 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.819
 you have it you can put 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.760
 quietly the berceto of the front 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.139
 bigazzi used the pod you can 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.510
 engrave a goal to make the seeds and then 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.550
 join them to the signature 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.470
 ok our cream is ready now 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:35.060
 let's go to a barattolino bar 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:39.560
 I chose a classic jar ok e 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.419
 our hazelnut cream is ready 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.610
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.070
 it is also valid for vegans because 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.780
 just replace the honey with 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.419
 any syrup from a syrup 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.430
 of apple maple or even barley malt 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.160
 of rice what you like in short 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.349
 this way you will make the cream vegan 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.690
 it is excellent for children but also for children 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.919
 big a kiss and the next how 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.919
