forest added in for the Lost Woods lost
we<00:00:39.149> added<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> trees<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:41.030> there<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.350> got

we added the trees we got there are got

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
we added the trees we got there are got
to<00:00:43.500> choose<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.640> didn't<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.300> had<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> light

here um the wedding me sorry I'm like I
said<00:00:54.210> analyzed<00:00:54.600> episode<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> still<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
said analyzed episode we still need a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:05.119 
said analyzed episode we still need a
dent<00:00:56.010> in<00:01:02.750> okay<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.140> added<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
dent in okay we also added in the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.899 
dent in okay we also added in the
pathway<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.510> Hyrule<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pathway to Hyrule I don't know we got it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.980 
pathway to Hyrule I don't know we got it
in<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:10.310> messed<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> way<00:01:12.360> we're<00:01:12.869> supposed

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
in I messed up with a way we're supposed

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.070 
in I messed up with a way we're supposed
to<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.900> made

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to go with it so what it is we just made

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
to go with it so what it is we just made
them<00:01:16.229> tunnel<00:01:16.650> line<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.430> added<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
them tunnel line but we added in a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.499 
them tunnel line but we added in a
railroad<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.810> guys<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> UM<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
railroad so when you guys go to UM the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
railroad so when you guys go to UM the
get<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> higher<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.860> leaf<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> guys

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
get to higher on the leaf if you guys

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
get to higher on the leaf if you guys
want<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> star<00:01:24.390> line<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
want to do the star line or make a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.530 
want to do the star line or make a
sterile<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.710> friend<00:01:26.009> again<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> time

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
sterile my friend again this is the time

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
sterile my friend again this is the time
i<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:28.080> um<00:01:29.090> busy<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:31.250> we're<00:01:32.250> gonna

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
i got to take um busy from we're gonna

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.800 
i got to take um busy from we're gonna
but<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> belt<00:01:33.450> high<00:01:33.540> roll<00:01:33.689> over

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
but we also got a belt high roll over

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
but we also got a belt high roll over
here<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:35.189> built<00:01:35.460> not

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
here because we kind of be built not

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.340 
here because we kind of be built not
backwards<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.869> where<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> gotta<00:01:37.740> fix<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
backwards so where the gotta fix that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
backwards so where the gotta fix that
vessels<00:01:40.350> started<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> deco<00:01:41.310> tree<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.540> see

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
vessels started the deco tree I just see

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
vessels started the deco tree I just see
here<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.079> couple<00:01:43.229> seconds<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.159> take<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
here in a couple seconds as we take the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
here in a couple seconds as we take the
tunnel<00:01:44.939> gone<00:01:45.899> long<00:01:46.380> tunnel<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:48.630> took<00:01:49.350> us<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
tunnel gone long tunnel that took us a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
tunnel gone long tunnel that took us a
long<00:01:50.159> time<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.430> build<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
long time to build just because I was a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.859 
long time to build just because I was a
flooding<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.290> happen<00:01:52.680> during<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> bow

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
flooding that happen during it the bow

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.999 
flooding that happen during it the bow
we<00:01:58.409> built<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> pathway<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> Deku<00:02:00.570> Tree

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
we built the pathway to the Deku Tree

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.609 
we built the pathway to the Deku Tree
it's<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> similar<00:02:02.759> fact<00:02:03.420> why<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.140> fact<00:02:04.350> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's a similar fact why not in fact as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's a similar fact why not in fact as
you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.009> nice<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.229> limitations

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you know it's nice we at the limitations

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.690 
you know it's nice we at the limitations
of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> 32<00:02:08.280> bits<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:11.520> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
of the 32 bits that we have and this is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.600 
of the 32 bits that we have and this is
the<00:02:11.849> deco<00:02:12.090> tree<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.810> may<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the deco tree as you may see the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.820 
the deco tree as you may see the
these<00:02:13.730> are<00:02:14.240> still<00:02:14.930> need<00:02:15.140> being<00:02:15.410> spread<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.600> but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
these are still need being spread of but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.640 
these are still need being spread of but
in<00:02:18.830> due<00:02:19.040> time<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.460> will<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.240> done<00:02:20.690> what

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
in due time we will have that done what

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.160 
in due time we will have that done what
by<00:02:21.860> probably<00:02:22.280> maybe<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.910> two<00:02:23.090> days<00:02:23.240> or<00:02:23.570> maybe

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
