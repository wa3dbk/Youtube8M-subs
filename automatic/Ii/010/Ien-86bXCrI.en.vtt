in<00:00:02.220> my<00:00:02.399> work<00:00:02.580> with<00:00:02.730> schools<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.210> England<00:00:03.810> and

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
in my work with schools in England and

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.260 
in my work with schools in England and
more<00:00:04.200> broadly<00:00:04.440> which<00:00:05.069> try<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.850> encourage<00:00:06.060> you

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
more broadly which try and encourage you

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.220 
more broadly which try and encourage you
to<00:00:06.299> use<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:06.960> would<00:00:07.080> call<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
to use what we would call a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.890 
to use what we would call a
problem-solving<00:00:07.950> approach<00:00:08.630> teachers<00:00:09.630> tend

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
problem-solving approach teachers tend

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.749 
problem-solving approach teachers tend
to<00:00:10.230> teach<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.530> way<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.160> they<00:00:11.309> were<00:00:11.370> taught

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
to teach the way that they were taught

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.629 
to teach the way that they were taught
and<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.360> have<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> cycle<00:00:13.349> continue<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.309> very

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and so you have a cycle continue a very

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
and so you have a cycle continue a very
traditional<00:00:14.940> practice<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.440> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
traditional practice and actually if you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.170 
traditional practice and actually if you
walked<00:00:16.740> into<00:00:16.830> most<00:00:17.160> maths<00:00:17.430> classrooms<00:00:17.970> now

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
walked into most maths classrooms now

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.609 
walked into most maths classrooms now
they<00:00:18.720> don't<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.140> wouldn't<00:00:19.470> look<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
they don't they wouldn't look that

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
they don't they wouldn't look that

days<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> work<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.039> teachers<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.560> really

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
days when I work with teachers I really

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
days when I work with teachers I really
tried<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> help<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.930> see<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.140> there<00:00:28.260> are

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
tried to help them see that there are

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.570 
tried to help them see that there are
different<00:00:28.590> ways<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.800> working<00:00:28.920> mathematics

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
different ways of working mathematics

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
different ways of working mathematics
that<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.210> very<00:00:30.750> interesting<00:00:31.260> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that can be very interesting for

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
that can be very interesting for
students<00:00:31.800> morning<00:00:32.309> everybody<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> welcome

students morning everybody and welcome
to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> University<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.469> Sussex<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.219> name's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to the University of Sussex my name's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
to the University of Sussex my name's
professor<00:00:35.790> Jo<00:00:36.360> bowler<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.930> today<00:00:37.500> we're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
professor Jo bowler and today we're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.990 
professor Jo bowler and today we're
going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.920> doing<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.219> maths<00:00:38.370> together<00:00:38.730> so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
going to be doing some maths together so

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
going to be doing some maths together so
maths<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.899> sort<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.379> around<00:00:40.649> us<00:00:40.950> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
maths is really sort of all around us in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
maths is really sort of all around us in
the<00:00:41.399> world<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.850> nature<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.420> art<00:00:43.820> technology

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the world in nature in art technology

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.979 
the world in nature in art technology
but<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> particularly<00:00:45.809> interesting

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
but this is a particularly interesting

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
but this is a particularly interesting
shape<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.879> front<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
shape and we have it here in front of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.020 
shape and we have it here in front of
you<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.340> what<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> thinking

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you and what we're going to be thinking

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510 
you and what we're going to be thinking
about<00:00:51.090> today<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.530> shape<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.190> built

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
about today is how this shape is built

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
about today is how this shape is built
how<00:00:54.000> its<00:00:54.180> structured<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.680> question

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
how its structured and the question

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
how its structured and the question
we're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.379> how<00:00:58.379> could

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
we're going to think about is how could

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
we're going to think about is how could
you<00:00:58.680> predict<00:00:59.250> without<00:00:59.879> counting<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.719> would

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you predict without counting how would

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
you predict without counting how would
you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.079> without<00:01:01.350> counting<00:01:01.620> how<00:01:01.920> many<00:01:02.129> cubes

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you know without counting how many cubes

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
you know without counting how many cubes
there<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> shape<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
there in that shape so if you go back to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.050 
there in that shape so if you go back to
your<00:01:05.489> groups

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
your groups

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
your groups
pick<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:06.990> beanbags<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.950> get

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pick up your beanbags and you can get

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.420 
pick up your beanbags and you can get
going<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:09.500> mean<00:01:10.500> query<00:01:10.770> based<00:01:10.950> learning<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going I mean query based learning I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.250 
going I mean query based learning I
think<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.790> me<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.240> having<00:01:12.840> students<00:01:13.200> use

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
think for me is having students use

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580 
think for me is having students use
their<00:01:13.560> own<00:01:13.710> ideas<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.299> combine<00:01:15.439> their<00:01:16.439> own

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
their own ideas and combine their own

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
their own ideas and combine their own
thinking<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.400> standard<00:01:17.909> mathematical

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

standard<00:01:21.990> methods<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.650> practice<00:01:23.220> and

solve real problems and in that process

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.969 
solve real problems and in that process
they<00:01:34.680> tend<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:36.110> be<00:01:37.110> able<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.890> more

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979

creative and use their own thinking and
their<00:01:40.049> own<00:01:40.229> ideas<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.250> usually<00:01:41.880> much

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
problems that are visual that really

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.350 
problems that are visual that really
helps<00:01:58.180> them<00:01:58.450> see<00:01:59.549> standard<00:02:00.549> mathematics<00:02:01.149> it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
helps them see standard mathematics it

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.120 
helps them see standard mathematics it
sort<00:02:01.509> of<00:02:01.539> makes<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.960> come<00:02:02.229> alive<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.920> them

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
sort of makes it come alive for them

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.730 
sort of makes it come alive for them
people<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.240> realized<00:02:04.960> for<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.289> long<00:02:05.470> time

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
people have realized for a long time

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.009 
people have realized for a long time
that<00:02:06.100> engaging<00:02:06.549> we're<00:02:07.179> actively<00:02:07.600> getting

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
that engaging we're actively getting

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.040 
that engaging we're actively getting
them<00:02:08.259> thinking<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.160> using<00:02:09.399> their<00:02:09.700> own<00:02:10.050> ideas

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
them thinking and using their own ideas

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.050 
them thinking and using their own ideas
helps<00:02:11.769> them<00:02:11.950> learn<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.550> makes<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.940> more

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
helps them learn it makes it more

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.540 
helps them learn it makes it more
interesting<00:02:13.330> for<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.019> but<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.709> also<00:02:14.800> shows

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
interesting for them but it also shows

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.830 
interesting for them but it also shows
them<00:02:15.790> something<00:02:16.030> which<00:02:16.209> they<00:02:16.360> may<00:02:16.480> not<00:02:16.510> know

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
them something which they may not know

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.240 
them something which they may not know
which<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.590> here's<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.010> math<00:02:18.220> problem

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
which is that here's this math problem

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.130 
which is that here's this math problem
that<00:02:18.819> can<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.239> approached<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.989> whole

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that can be approached in a whole

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.910 
that can be approached in a whole
variety<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.680> ways<00:02:22.230> legitimately<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.709> can

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
variety of ways legitimately and you can

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.789 
variety of ways legitimately and you can
sort<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.160> come<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:25.150> same<00:02:25.959> conclusion<00:02:26.680> but

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
sort of come to the same conclusion but

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.080 
sort of come to the same conclusion but
through<00:02:27.040> very<00:02:27.220> different<00:02:27.549> pathways<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
through very different pathways and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.720 
through very different pathways and
that's<00:02:28.569> an<00:02:28.780> important<00:02:29.230> message<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:30.130> students

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
that's an important message for students

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.720 
that's an important message for students
okay<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.870> everybody<00:02:32.260> would<00:02:32.410> like<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.830> stop

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
okay if everybody would like to stop

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
okay if everybody would like to stop
there<00:02:33.910> you've<00:02:34.120> been<00:02:34.360> working<00:02:34.870> fantastically

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
there you've been working fantastically

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.259 
there you've been working fantastically
we've<00:02:35.799> got<00:02:35.920> lots<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.459> different<00:02:36.790> ideas<00:02:37.150> from

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
we've got lots of different ideas from

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.400 
we've got lots of different ideas from
different<00:02:37.630> groups<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.019> what<00:02:38.140> we're<00:02:38.260> going<00:02:38.380> to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
different groups so what we're going to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.930 
different groups so what we're going to
do<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> come<00:02:39.519> up<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.790> present

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
do now is have you come up and present

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.960 
do now is have you come up and present
some<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.569> your<00:02:40.750> ideas<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.799> I'd<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.819> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
some of your ideas so I'd like you to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270 
some of your ideas so I'd like you to
get<00:02:43.239> your<00:02:43.360> posters<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.260> your<00:02:44.350> cubes<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.130> your

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
get your posters and your cubes and your

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.339 
get your posters and your cubes and your
beanbags<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.209> all<00:02:46.360> come<00:02:46.569> into<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.870> central

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
beanbags and all come into the central

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.759 
beanbags and all come into the central
space<00:02:49.410> really<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.920> math<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.579> way<00:02:51.940> of

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
space really I see math as a way of

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.990 
space really I see math as a way of
interpreting<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.250> understanding<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.970> world

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
interpreting and understanding the world

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.360 
interpreting and understanding the world
and<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.720> also<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.500> form<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.100> communication

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and it's also a form of communication

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.300 
and it's also a form of communication
like<00:02:58.329> mathematics<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.680> way<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
like mathematics really is a way of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.810 
like mathematics really is a way of
representing<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.480> world<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.290> way<00:03:02.470> that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
representing the world the way that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.390 
representing the world the way that
seashells<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.739> pinecones<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.829> flowers<00:03:06.250> are

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
seashells and pinecones and flowers are

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.150 
seashells and pinecones and flowers are
constructed<00:03:06.910> all<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.450> same<00:03:07.720> ratio<00:03:08.620> which

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
constructed all in the same ratio which

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.740 
constructed all in the same ratio which
is<00:03:09.370> really<00:03:09.700> very<00:03:09.880> interesting<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.329> parts<00:03:10.660> of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
is really very interesting in parts of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.680 
is really very interesting in parts of
the<00:03:10.840> human<00:03:10.959> body<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.430> school<00:03:13.420> children

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
the human body and so school children

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.420 
the human body and so school children
often<00:03:13.989> know<00:03:14.019> nothing<00:03:14.530> about<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:15.040> maths

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
often know nothing about that that maths

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.620 
often know nothing about that that maths
is<00:03:16.170> represented<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.290> nature<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> world

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
is represented in nature and the world

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.660 
is represented in nature and the world
and<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.290> very<00:03:20.680> varied

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and it's this very varied

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.240 
and it's this very varied
multi-dimensional<00:03:22.269> subject<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.980> get<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
multi-dimensional subject so to get the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.990 
multi-dimensional subject so to get the
final<00:03:24.519> formula<00:03:25.060> certain<00:03:25.569> two<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.340> these

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
final formula certain two of the these

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.030 
final formula certain two of the these
shapes<00:03:28.390> then<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.140> final<00:03:29.470> end<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.859> life

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
shapes then the final end is the life

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.540 
shapes then the final end is the life
the<00:03:30.190> column

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
the column

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.900 
the column
we<00:03:31.090> thought<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.450> each<00:03:32.380> side<00:03:32.740> of<00:03:32.920> these<00:03:33.100> was<00:03:33.880> a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
we thought that each side of these was a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.060 
we thought that each side of these was a
triangle<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:35.020> used<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.440> half<00:03:35.650> base<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.040> think

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
triangle so we used a half base I think

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.010 
triangle so we used a half base I think
it's<00:03:36.340> hugely<00:03:36.730> rewarding<00:03:37.060> for<00:03:37.540> teachers<00:03:37.870> and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
it's hugely rewarding for teachers and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.660 
it's hugely rewarding for teachers and
that's<00:03:38.380> usually<00:03:38.770> how<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.220> teachers<00:03:39.550> to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
that's usually how you get teachers to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.160 
that's usually how you get teachers to
use<00:03:39.700> inquiry<00:03:40.240> based<00:03:40.390> methods<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:40.960> they

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
use inquiry based methods is that they

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.110 
use inquiry based methods is that they
try<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.710> they<00:03:41.950> said<00:03:42.190> wow<00:03:42.370> these<00:03:42.730> students

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
try it and they said wow these students

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.460 
try it and they said wow these students
are<00:03:43.240> really<00:03:43.330> interested<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.320> they're

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
are really interested and they're

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.200 
are really interested and they're
engaged<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.130> they're<00:03:45.220> coming<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.120> these

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
engaged and they're coming up these

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.210 
engaged and they're coming up these
great<00:03:46.480> ideas<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:47.110> it's<00:03:47.230> quite<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.740> revelation

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
great ideas and it's quite a revelation
