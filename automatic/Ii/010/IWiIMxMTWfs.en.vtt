was part of my magic of Game of Thrones
and<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.670> would<00:03:20.880> imagine<00:03:21.030> for<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> lot<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.840> book

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
and I would imagine for a lot of book

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.920 
and I would imagine for a lot of book
readers<00:03:22.260> felt<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.800> same<00:03:23.010> way<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.820> now<00:03:24.690> we're

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
readers felt the same way but now we're

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.240 
readers felt the same way but now we're
getting<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> point<00:03:25.530> where<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.890> it's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
getting to the point where it's it's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.130 
getting to the point where it's it's
gonna<00:03:26.550> be<00:03:26.730> scary<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.330> don't<00:03:27.600> know<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.960> don't<00:03:28.020> know

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
