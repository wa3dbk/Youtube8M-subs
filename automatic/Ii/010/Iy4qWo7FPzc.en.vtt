00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 equal to boys and girls I am robe and here 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.990
 I'm back with all of you and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.269
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.179
 online we are in a new 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 career that I'm seeing I'm here with 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.929
 subscribers that I'm seeing that is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.029
 behind the control point is not 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.029
 here in front but I do not know exactly 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.780
 now it's down there's more boy worth 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.300
 Now once this point is taken, stop 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.820
 go from happy to leave behind 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.880
 Balear here here and here around here 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 It's worth flash already is already worth it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.970
 over here scott and I say in the points 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 basically worth this one is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.070
 more relative is here because the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.590
 next one is worth jumping or that 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.590
 now it must be as below 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.040
 they are like false those gossip to my son 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 perfect 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.829
 worth is worth the important thing to catch 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.530
 good point I'm here with subscribers 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.850
 ok so normally these things that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 rebuilders the only announce to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.420
 through twitter 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:31.759
 What happens to you when you leave quietly? 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:34.640
 It's not good to see the next attempt 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.009
 next attempt is complicated we are 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.009
 all on the same ramp to work 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:49.250
 to see how the thing is going 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.500
 so straight with meter read my game well there 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.179
 that to catch the if not you can not see 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.250
 see to see there is 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:00.220
 well let it perfect -non 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.220
 it's wrong if not why 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 problematic agents was proved 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.670
 simply 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.150
 voucher voucher voucher 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:19.410
 yes it's worth 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.410
 but man no longer 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.020
 well at the end we are all here together 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.660
 I was doing very well because I had put 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.740
 according to I was going to chabat 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 boy had already put second in a 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.170
 moment even first it came to go 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.570
 and of course this would have to be without 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.770
 contact which I think it says 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.770
 the activity itself 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.950
 this is one way lane 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.950
 this is over booking in the the in it 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.210
 one already happened it seems to me because I am 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.980
 watching on the radar 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.400
 to see why you put them so little for a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.400
 little to either in the perfect center 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.220
 but if it's not perfect to see if it was 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 nobody is doing it well we can pass 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.280
 well next perfect point removes uncle 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.270
 I thought that against that you gave yourself for that 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.810
 I was walking with a little bit of care 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.810
 forever 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.550
 and I do not see anything about us is just as 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.770
 perfect perfect perfect that has gone 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.330
 well and they see you on the site but good 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 come on this is missing people we pass already 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.390
 because simple when it happened me so much 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.390
 others and meanwhile not 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.620
 over here because I see lessons to 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.760
 everyone 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.430
 lack of the very long cartonera the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.660
 true in terms of mileage and that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.610
 but well let's see if because I do not 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.209
 understood absolutely nothing and others by 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.590
 here 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.590
 because that happened 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.580
 why as now 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 boy is not lucky once I 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 I have done very badly 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.040
 there goes boy there goes that what there is that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.000
 to do is turn around a bit and because you do not 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.820
 I'll stay in the hole 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.260
 there go people good people still by 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.990
 the jump as I'm seeing if there are people 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.150
 in the jump and this I'm going to do it 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.150
 when it's like that, looking at me a little 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.390
 good at the end here that happens here that 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.820
 there are here at the bottom are all here all 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.740
 the glued here in the background to see 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.920
 to see to see tell me there is a ramp is 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.020
 a twig that happens to you happens to you 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.180
 do what you just did 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.820
 basically to the logically neither of coña 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.730
 I see how I'm going right now or 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.830
 coña vale the thing is that I have vehicles 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.560
 without customization 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.710
 and maybe it's here 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.230
 for the bad 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.540
 I do not know I do not know if this is going to be able 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.570
 I do not know if this will be able to get to 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.570
 watch 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.520
 today almost if I had not if I had been 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.750
 a little more to the other side what 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.580
 it was itching to the left 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.990
 come you can get caught you can get caught 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.290
 because I also believe that there is one who has 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.570
 caught it has already happened is the jump 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.910
 jump - a good one is coming already 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.560
 but good so I see this can be 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.400
 to catch even if it seemed like the best 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.350
 do not 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.700
 to see to see to see if here is that 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.750
 good was good was good 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.750
 I caught good catches miss it 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.260
 that 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.360
 pity that you can second insist 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.360
 because just before catching what 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.100
 I have here one this is the fifth 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.460
 exploded and they almost float me and it's also worth 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.460
 OK 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.020
 and I love these themes 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:28.659
 I believe that people are arriving already if 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:28.659
 there is a jump that why 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.340
 he has already loaded me 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:49.840
 if you look there we are and how beautiful we are 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.840
 we go quickly 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.210
 guys you can not go through or at least 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.820
 never to see it 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.770
 what I want is the minimal interface 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.180
 Show marker now because nothing I 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.020
 let's stay here guys because the 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.020
 people I do not know how much 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.840
 the good thing I do not know how much he works 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.760
 efe guys the truth that until the 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.350
 less half I do not seem to finish the 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.900
 departure and a few are missing 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.680
