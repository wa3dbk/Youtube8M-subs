forward<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.140> this<00:00:56.260> replica<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.370> think<00:00:57.580> a

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
forward to this replica and I think a

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.750 
forward to this replica and I think a
lot<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:57.820> them<00:00:58.000> are<00:00:58.089> going<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.239> be<00:00:58.300> letdown<00:00:59.760> main

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
reason because the WWE casted tag

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.790 
reason because the WWE casted tag
replicas<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.039> the<00:01:06.610> cast<00:01:06.850> did<00:01:07.060> WWE<00:01:07.660> classic<00:01:08.140> IC

lot<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.690> people<00:03:10.930> were<00:03:11.020> thinking<00:03:11.050> finally

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
lot of people were thinking finally

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.140 
lot of people were thinking finally
we're<00:03:11.800> gonna<00:03:11.920> get<00:03:12.070> high-quality<00:03:12.310> replicas

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
we're gonna get high-quality replicas

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.360 
we're gonna get high-quality replicas
that's<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.260> screen<00:03:14.560> accurate<00:03:14.739> but

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that's going to be screen accurate but

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.400 
that's going to be screen accurate but
again<00:03:15.670> figures<00:03:16.030> Inc<00:03:16.209> have<00:03:16.690> not<00:03:17.110> followed

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
again figures Inc have not followed

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.710 
again figures Inc have not followed
through<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.580> see<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.209> bars<00:03:19.510> they

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
through here you see the bars they

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.150 
through here you see the bars they
aren't<00:03:20.080> connected<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> main<00:03:20.770> plate<00:03:20.980> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
aren't connected to the main plate and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970 
aren't connected to the main plate and
again<00:03:21.970> they've<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.570> made<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> tiny<00:03:23.110> tweak<00:03:23.440> but

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
again they've just made a tiny tweak but

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.310 
again they've just made a tiny tweak but
it's<00:03:24.100> still<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:24.700> my<00:03:25.060> opinion<00:03:25.540> not<00:03:25.870> good<00:03:26.080> enough

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
it's still in my opinion not good enough

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.800 
it's still in my opinion not good enough
you<00:03:26.860> see<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.550> little<00:03:27.880> tiny

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you see there the little tiny

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
the inside of the twisted bars going

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.220 
the inside of the twisted bars going
towards<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.970> main<00:03:34.120> plate<00:03:34.330> but<00:03:34.780> still<00:03:35.080> not

plates<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.060> I've<00:03:58.180> seen<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.660> far<00:03:58.690> from<00:03:59.320> the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
plates that I've seen so far from the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.039 
plates that I've seen so far from the
pictures<00:03:59.769> looks<00:04:00.430> more<00:04:00.940> shallow<00:04:01.360> than<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.840> big

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
pictures looks more shallow than the big

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.449 
pictures looks more shallow than the big
eagle<00:04:02.380> cast<00:04:02.590> which<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.890> find<00:04:03.130> very<00:04:03.190> very

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
eagle cast which I find very very

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.520 
eagle cast which I find very very
surprising<00:04:04.030> now<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.900> respect<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.320> could

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
surprising now in this respect I could

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.380 
surprising now in this respect I could
be<00:04:05.650> wrong<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:06.130> might<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:06.820> be<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.090> pictures

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
be wrong it might just be the pictures

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.759 
be wrong it might just be the pictures
but<00:04:07.630> from<00:04:07.810> what<00:04:07.930> I've<00:04:08.019> seen<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.410> does<00:04:08.590> look

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
but from what I've seen it does look

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.789 
but from what I've seen it does look
remarkably<00:04:09.220> shallow<00:04:09.519> but<00:04:10.150> still<00:04:10.470> quite<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.590> bit

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
remarkably shallow but still quite a bit

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.229 
remarkably shallow but still quite a bit
deeper<00:04:12.160> than<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.459> original<00:04:12.880> replicas

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
deeper than the original replicas

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.740 
deeper than the original replicas
themselves<00:04:15.030> another<00:04:16.030> issue<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.419> have<00:04:16.720> with

looks like then onto the main plate with
the<00:04:45.070> fat<00:04:45.280> one<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:46.210> really<00:04:46.390> you've<00:04:46.720> got<00:04:46.750> three

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
the fat one so really you've got three

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.520

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
which to me just both looks

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.220 
which to me just both looks
sounds<00:04:54.130> utterly<00:04:54.310> ridiculous<00:04:55.210> again<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.080> goes

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
sounds utterly ridiculous again it goes

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.190 
sounds utterly ridiculous again it goes
back<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.530> wrestling<00:04:57.520> superstores

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200

unwillingness to change their ways of
working<00:05:01.360> or<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.350> down<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.710> pure<00:05:02.920> laziness

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
working or just down to pure laziness

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.910 
working or just down to pure laziness
because<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.720> just<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.230> something<00:05:05.650> like<00:05:05.770> this

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
because I just think something like this

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.950 
because I just think something like this
where<00:05:06.190> you've<00:05:06.700> said<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.150> people<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:07.660> they

detailed that strap was and how it was

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.930 
detailed that strap was and how it was
sort<00:05:28.210> of<00:05:28.290> imitating<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.470> real<00:05:29.680> strap<00:05:30.100> but<00:05:30.730> here

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
sort of imitating a real strap but here

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.160 
sort of imitating a real strap but here
again<00:05:31.330> they<00:05:31.450> just<00:05:31.600> have<00:05:31.720> bothered<00:05:31.900> they'd

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
again they just have bothered they'd

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.100 
again they just have bothered they'd
gone<00:05:32.320> back<00:05:32.500> to<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.680> old<00:05:32.710> style<00:05:33.100> of<00:05:33.220> getting

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
gone back to the old style of getting

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.320 
gone back to the old style of getting
simulated<00:05:35.110> leather<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.620> then<00:05:36.190> stitching<00:05:37.000> a

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
simulated leather and then stitching a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.330 
simulated leather and then stitching a
simulated<00:05:37.900> leather<00:05:38.020> patch<00:05:38.350> over<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.950> buckles

simulated leather patch over the buckles

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.060 
simulated leather patch over the buckles
it<00:05:39.970> just<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.420> makes<00:05:40.660> no<00:05:40.900> sense<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.290> it<00:05:41.470> doesn't

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070

sorry the big eagle cast came out very

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.710 
sorry the big eagle cast came out very
flat<00:06:14.650> as<00:06:14.770> well<00:06:14.950> while<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:15.460> could<00:06:15.640> be<00:06:15.669> curved<00:06:16.060> it

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
flat as well while it could be curved it

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.110 
flat as well while it could be curved it
still<00:06:17.200> was<00:06:17.590> released<00:06:17.890> to<00:06:18.070> be<00:06:18.190> very<00:06:18.460> flat<00:06:18.820> and

still was released to be very flat and

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.450 
still was released to be very flat and
it's<00:06:19.690> just<00:06:19.900> small<00:06:20.620> things<00:06:20.650> like<00:06:20.980> that<00:06:21.160> that<00:06:21.340> if

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
it's just small things like that that if

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.730 
it's just small things like that that if
you<00:06:21.580> tweaked<00:06:22.030> them<00:06:22.330> it<00:06:23.080> could<00:06:23.200> be<00:06:23.380> 10<00:06:23.590> times

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
you tweaked them it could be 10 times

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.409 
you tweaked them it could be 10 times
about<00:06:24.010> up<00:06:24.160> but<00:06:24.190> they<00:06:24.669> just<00:06:24.850> don't<00:06:25.000> bother<00:06:25.270> I

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
about up but they just don't bother I

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.000 
about up but they just don't bother I
think<00:06:25.660> it's<00:06:25.750> very<00:06:25.840> disappointing<00:06:26.380> and<00:06:26.530> I

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
think it's very disappointing and I

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.230 
think it's very disappointing and I
think<00:06:27.220> it's<00:06:27.340> unfair<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.669> the<00:06:27.820> people<00:06:28.030> who<00:06:28.090> buy

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
think it's unfair to the people who buy

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.630 
think it's unfair to the people who buy
them<00:06:28.450> I<00:06:29.169> know<00:06:29.680> if<00:06:29.890> I<00:06:29.980> were<00:06:30.100> still<00:06:30.220> collecting

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
them I know if I were still collecting

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.980 
them I know if I were still collecting
replica<00:06:30.940> belts<00:06:31.150> I'd<00:06:31.300> be<00:06:31.510> rather<00:06:31.630> pissed

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990

everything from the wings there and

winged eagle art which wasn't like the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.500 
winged eagle art which wasn't like the
real<00:06:40.060> thing

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
real thing

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.290 
real thing
they've<00:06:40.930> erased<00:06:41.560> the<00:06:41.919> WWF<00:06:42.550> brach<00:06:42.730> logo<00:06:43.060> and

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
they've erased the WWF brach logo and

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.680 
they've erased the WWF brach logo and
smacked<00:06:43.570> on<00:06:43.950> inaccurate<00:06:44.950> WWE<00:06:45.669> logos<00:06:46.270> on<00:06:46.480> there

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
smacked on inaccurate WWE logos on there

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.240 
smacked on inaccurate WWE logos on there
and<00:06:46.840> then<00:06:47.380> throw<00:06:47.560> them<00:06:47.740> out<00:06:47.800> to<00:06:47.890> the<00:06:47.950> public

and then throw them out to the public
which<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:48.940> think<00:06:49.150> it's<00:06:49.240> kind<00:06:49.419> of<00:06:49.450> pathetic<00:06:50.220> now

which I think it's kind of pathetic now

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.790 
which I think it's kind of pathetic now
as<00:06:51.550> far<00:06:51.790> as<00:06:51.850> getting<00:06:52.150> it<00:06:52.330> is<00:06:52.390> concerned<00:06:52.810> if<00:06:53.740> you

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
as far as getting it is concerned if you

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.610 
as far as getting it is concerned if you

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
say go for it I mean it's not a terrible

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.990 
say go for it I mean it's not a terrible
price<00:06:59.890> it's<00:07:00.160> more<00:07:00.340> expensive<00:07:00.490> than<00:07:00.760> the

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
price it's more expensive than the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.120 
price it's more expensive than the
original<00:07:01.360> ones<00:07:01.510> but<00:07:02.320> it's<00:07:02.740> not<00:07:02.890> a<00:07:02.919> terrible
