no matter what happens because playing
with<00:02:51.069> such<00:02:51.280> low<00:02:51.519> chemistry<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.540> difficult

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
with such low chemistry it's difficult

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.960 
with such low chemistry it's difficult
and<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.379> brings<00:02:53.590> up<00:02:53.890> today's<00:02:54.190> question<00:02:54.790> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
day is how important is chemistry in

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.710 
day is how important is chemistry in
fifa<00:03:04.450> ultimate<00:03:04.659> team<00:03:05.670> from<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.819> scale<00:03:07.060> from<00:03:07.390> 1

to 10 how important do you think

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.949 
to 10 how important do you think
chemistry<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.940> I'll<00:03:12.940> give<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.329> my<00:03:13.480> answer<00:03:13.659> in

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
chemistry is I'll give you my answer in

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.869 
chemistry is I'll give you my answer in
tomorrow's<00:03:14.409> episode<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.220> as<00:03:15.579> it's

tomorrow's episode and as it's

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.190 
tomorrow's episode and as it's
interesting<00:03:16.329> because<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.840> reason<00:03:17.139> I'm

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
interesting because the reason I'm

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.509 
interesting because the reason I'm
making<00:03:17.319> this<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.799> was<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:17.919> nice<00:03:18.099> free-kick

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
making this that was a nice free-kick

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.220 
making this that was a nice free-kick
wasn't<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.450> reason<00:03:19.630> I'm<00:03:19.840> making<00:03:19.959> this

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
wasn't it but the reason I'm making this

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.839 
wasn't it but the reason I'm making this
today's<00:03:20.500> question<00:03:20.919> today<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.430> after<00:03:21.819> we

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
dealer oh looks like chemistry's not a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.119 
dealer oh looks like chemistry's not a
big<00:03:31.180> deal<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.660> we'll<00:03:32.290> go<00:03:32.470> we'll<00:03:32.739> be<00:03:32.889> able<00:03:32.980> to

and<00:04:26.680> you're<00:04:27.130> my<00:04:27.310> defending<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:27.970> atrocious

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
and you're my defending is atrocious

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.939 
and you're my defending is atrocious
with<00:04:28.960> these<00:04:29.169> players<00:04:29.440> because<00:04:29.710> i<00:04:29.800> have<00:04:29.919> a

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
with these players because i have a

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.439 
with these players because i have a
centre-back<00:04:30.550> playing<00:04:30.850> right<00:04:31.060> back<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.330> just

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
centre-back playing right back I just

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.050 
centre-back playing right back I just
can't<00:04:31.930> keep<00:04:32.110> people<00:04:32.470> lined<00:04:32.740> up<00:04:32.980> like<00:04:33.880> that

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
can't keep people lined up like that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.550 
can't keep people lined up like that
centre-backs<00:04:34.600> always<00:04:34.870> putting<00:04:35.110> everybody<00:04:35.470> on

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
centre-backs always putting everybody on

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.960 
centre-backs always putting everybody on
side<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.250> could<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:36.580> play<00:04:36.760> through

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
side so you could just play through

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.600 
side so you could just play through
passes<00:04:37.479> through<00:04:37.660> my<00:04:37.780> defense<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:39.100> not<00:04:39.370> good

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610
