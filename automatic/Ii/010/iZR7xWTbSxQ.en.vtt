00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
figure I picked it up a target retail

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.819 
figure I picked it up a target retail
prices<00:01:19.429> either<00:01:19.579> 1099<00:01:20.329> or<00:01:20.570> 1199<00:01:21.289> depending<00:01:21.740> on

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
prices either 1099 or 1199 depending on

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.219 
prices either 1099 or 1199 depending on
which<00:01:21.979> store<00:01:22.219> you<00:01:22.250> buy<00:01:22.429> that<00:01:22.929> the<00:01:23.929> only<00:01:24.140> reason

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
which store you buy that the only reason

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.749 
which store you buy that the only reason
i<00:01:24.530> currently<00:01:24.859> have<00:01:25.070> him<00:01:25.280> right<00:01:25.460> now<00:01:25.490> is

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
i currently have him right now is

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.130 
i currently have him right now is
because<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.210> part<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.570> advanced<00:01:27.020> way

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
because it's part of the advanced way

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.480 
because it's part of the advanced way
and<00:01:27.710> if<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:27.859> don't<00:01:28.009> know<00:01:28.100> what<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.219> advanced

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
and if you don't know what the advanced

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.130 
and if you don't know what the advanced
wave<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.880> it's<00:01:29.149> basically<00:01:29.299> where<00:01:29.780> they<00:01:29.899> take<00:01:30.079> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
wave is it's basically where they take a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.389 
wave is it's basically where they take a
couple<00:01:30.380> figures<00:01:30.740> from<00:01:30.859> the<00:01:30.950> whole<00:01:31.159> entire

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
couple figures from the whole entire

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.679 
couple figures from the whole entire
series<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.090> they<00:01:32.179> make<00:01:32.329> them<00:01:32.479> available

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
series and they make them available

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.569 
series and they make them available
before<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.649> whole<00:01:33.770> series<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.280> available

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
before the whole series is available

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.149 
before the whole series is available
itself<00:01:35.359> so<00:01:36.259> basically<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:36.799> get<00:01:36.890> an<00:01:37.009> early

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
itself so basically you get an early

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.580 
itself so basically you get an early
chance<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.729> get<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> couple<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.299> figures<00:01:38.630> so

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
chance to get a couple of the figures so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.709 
chance to get a couple of the figures so
the<00:01:40.039> advanced<00:01:40.310> wave<00:01:40.549> contains<00:01:40.999> Carter<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
the advanced wave contains Carter the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.099 
the advanced wave contains Carter the
grunt<00:01:41.960> minor<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.590> White<00:01:42.829> Spartan<00:01:43.340> CQC<00:01:43.999> and

grunt minor the White Spartan CQC and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.139 
grunt minor the White Spartan CQC and

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
back here it's in between the two

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.410 
back here it's in between the two
grenade<00:03:01.069> pegs<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.819> use<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.090> put<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
grenade pegs that you use to put the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.210 
grenade pegs that you use to put the
grenades<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.680> why<00:03:03.830> i<00:03:03.860> don't<00:03:04.100> have

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
grenades on so that's why i don't have

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.740 
grenades on so that's why i don't have
the<00:03:04.310> grenade<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> figure<00:03:05.030> i<00:03:05.209> thought<00:03:05.600> it's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the grenade on the figure i thought it's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.360 
the grenade on the figure i thought it's
really<00:03:05.989> cool<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.200> they<00:03:06.500> managed<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.920> get<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
really cool that they managed to get the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.090 
really cool that they managed to get the
pouch<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.330> between<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.750> two<00:03:08.930> pegs<00:03:09.170> instead<00:03:10.010> of

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
pouch in between the two pegs instead of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.860 
pouch in between the two pegs instead of
actually<00:03:10.519> molding<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.030> onto<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.330> figure<00:03:11.690> i

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
actually molding it onto the figure i

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.539 
actually molding it onto the figure i
believe<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.530> removable<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.310> want<00:03:13.489> to

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
believe it is removable if you want to

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.250 
believe it is removable if you want to
take<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.940> because<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.690> between<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
take it off because it's in between the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.660 
take it off because it's in between the
two<00:03:15.410> pegs<00:03:15.620> but<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.069> know<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.310> still<00:03:16.489> cool

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
two pegs but you know it's still cool

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.460 
two pegs but you know it's still cool
that<00:03:16.850> they<00:03:16.970> put<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.360> there<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.319> got

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that they put that on there so it's got

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.580 
that they put that on there so it's got
