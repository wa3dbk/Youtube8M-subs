00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the yellow hair there and this was a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.760 
the yellow hair there and this was a
Count<00:01:35.850> Dooku<00:01:36.240> hairpiece<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> sacrificed

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and then I finished coloring the head

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
and then I finished coloring the head
there<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.040> Naruto<00:01:44.399> doesn't<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> gap

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there because Naruto doesn't have a gap

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.920 
there because Naruto doesn't have a gap
with<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.689> hair<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> closest

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
with the hair this was a closest

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.690 
with the hair this was a closest
hairpiece<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.590> could<00:01:49.799> find<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.939> wasn't<00:01:52.700> yeah

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
hairpiece I could find that wasn't yeah

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840 
hairpiece I could find that wasn't yeah
this<00:01:54.140> pretty<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.579> best

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this pretty much is not the best

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.749 
this pretty much is not the best
hairpiece<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.600> Naruto<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:59.310> really

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
hairpiece for Naruto and I really

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.840 
hairpiece for Naruto and I really
strongly<00:02:00.630> believe<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.170> Lego<00:02:02.159> should<00:02:02.670> be

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
strongly believe that Lego should be

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.520 
strongly believe that Lego should be
making<00:02:03.479> Naruto<00:02:04.229> sets<00:02:05.360> especially

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
making Naruto sets especially

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.610 
making Naruto sets especially
considering<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.710> Disney<00:02:08.399> has
