00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.960 
standard transmission this is your
linkage<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.890> clutch<00:02:05.790> would<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.619> somewhere

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
linkage here clutch would be somewhere

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.650 
linkage here clutch would be somewhere
up<00:02:08.970> over<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> what

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
up over here I think and this is what

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
up over here I think and this is what
the<00:02:12.900> front<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the front of the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.450 
the front of the
our<00:02:13.560> looks<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.980> when<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:14.280> missing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
our looks like when it's missing

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.260 
our looks like when it's missing
everything<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.480> were<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.780> unbolt<00:02:17.270> this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
everything if you were to unbolt this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.730 
everything if you were to unbolt this
bolt<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.720> two<00:02:18.870> others<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> whole

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
bolt and two others there the whole

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.920 
bolt and two others there the whole
strut<00:02:20.550> would<00:02:20.700> come<00:02:20.880> out<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.780> would

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
strut would come out and you would

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.790 
strut would come out and you would
literally<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.520> no<00:02:23.520> front<00:02:24.000> end<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> car

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
literally have no front end on this car

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.760 
literally have no front end on this car
motor<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.010> being<00:02:26.310> held<00:02:26.790> by<00:02:27.110> cherry<00:02:28.110> picker

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.220 

that's<00:02:31.770> where<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> clutch<00:02:32.310> would<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:33.200> got<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that's where the clutch would go got to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410 
that's where the clutch would go got to
pull<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> exhaust<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> clutches

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
pull all the exhaust to do the clutches

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
pull all the exhaust to do the clutches
on<00:02:36.570> these<00:02:36.780> things<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.650> said<00:02:37.950> no<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.520> don't<00:02:38.760> have

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
on these things we said no we don't have

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.420 
on these things we said no we don't have
to<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.390> let's<00:02:40.350> try<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.680> without<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.340> on

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to do that let's try it without so on

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.970 
to do that let's try it without so on
this<00:02:41.640> car<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.380> didn't<00:02:43.380> pull<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.560> exhaust

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
this car we didn't pull the exhaust

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280 
this car we didn't pull the exhaust
until<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.940> did<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.140> pull

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
until we did because you have to pull

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.900 
until we did because you have to pull
the<00:02:46.380> exhaust<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> front<00:02:47.400> end<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.790> these

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the exhaust to do the front end on these

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.870 
the exhaust to do the front end on these
things<00:02:48.350> really<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:50.030> lot<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.150> work<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:53.220> got<00:02:53.760> to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
things really a lot of work and I got to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030 
things really a lot of work and I got to
be<00:02:53.940> honest<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:54.450> really<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:55.709> cars

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
be honest I really do like these cars

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.530 
be honest I really do like these cars
and<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.310> think<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.580> should<00:02:56.610> buy<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> think

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and I think you should buy one I think

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.210 
and I think you should buy one I think
they're<00:02:57.750> better<00:02:58.020> cars<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.680> most<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
they're better cars and most of the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.290 
they're better cars and most of the
stuff<00:02:59.489> out<00:02:59.700> there<00:02:59.989> they<00:03:00.989> are<00:03:01.170> cheaper<00:03:01.709> than

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
stuff out there they are cheaper than

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380 
stuff out there they are cheaper than
then<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.540> Honda<00:03:04.410> stuff<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.820> my

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
then your Honda stuff and they are in my

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.210 
then your Honda stuff and they are in my
mind<00:03:06.690> at<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.709> very<00:03:08.040> least<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:09.390> equivalent

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
mind at the very least the equivalent

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220 
mind at the very least the equivalent
and<00:03:11.220> they<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.580> rust<00:03:11.910> as<00:03:12.150> bad<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.959> with

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
and they don't rust as bad so do with

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.970 
and they don't rust as bad so do with
that<00:03:13.440> what<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.709> will<00:03:14.900> they<00:03:15.900> are<00:03:15.930> awfully<00:03:16.739> nice

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that what you will they are awfully nice

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.850 
that what you will they are awfully nice
on<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.640> interior<00:03:18.239> they<00:03:18.540> last<00:03:18.900> forever<00:03:19.320> this

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
on the interior they last forever this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.520 
on the interior they last forever this
one<00:03:20.100> has<00:03:20.370> somewhere<00:03:20.940> around<00:03:21.049> 400,000<00:03:22.049> K<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
one has somewhere around 400,000 K on it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.210 
one has somewhere around 400,000 K on it
and<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.850> original<00:03:23.970> clutch<00:03:25.220> just

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and this is the original clutch just

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.009 
and this is the original clutch just
maintenance<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.959> is

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
maintenance on this one and this is

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.710 
maintenance on this one and this is
Manitoba<00:03:28.799> where<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.370> salty<00:03:29.970> like<00:03:30.120> crazy<00:03:30.480> on

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
Manitoba where it is salty like crazy on

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.949 
Manitoba where it is salty like crazy on
the<00:03:30.840> roads<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:33.000> guys<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.480> without<00:03:33.750> what

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the roads so you guys do without what

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.199 
the roads so you guys do without what
you<00:03:33.989> will<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.980> opinion<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> high

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
you will in my opinion this is a high

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.449 
you will in my opinion this is a high
quality<00:03:36.269> car<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.080> buy<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.040> proof<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.430> in

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
quality car to buy and the proof is in

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.000 
quality car to buy and the proof is in
the<00:03:38.610> pudding<00:03:39.500> probably<00:03:40.500> be<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> bunch<00:03:40.890> of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the pudding probably be a bunch of

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.830 
the pudding probably be a bunch of
comments<00:03:41.250> about<00:03:41.580> how<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:41.940> knew<00:03:42.299> someone<00:03:42.630> who

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
comments about how you knew someone who

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.420 
comments about how you knew someone who
had<00:03:42.870> one<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.350> these<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.769> didn't<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.190> it

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
had one of these and they didn't like it

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.759 
had one of these and they didn't like it
or<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.850> had<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> hemmed<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.600> pony<00:03:45.900> um<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> sucked

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
or you had a hemmed a pony um it sucked

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.750 
or you had a hemmed a pony um it sucked
yeah<00:03:47.010> well<00:03:48.049> okay<00:03:50.360> but<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.390> liked<00:03:51.660> it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
yeah well okay but I liked it

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.030 
yeah well okay but I liked it
just<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.820> lot<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.000> work<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.360> do<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> clutch<00:03:54.780> oh<00:03:55.140> by

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
just a lot of work to do a clutch oh by

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.490 
just a lot of work to do a clutch oh by
the<00:03:56.070> way<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.910> would<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.299> whole<00:03:57.720> subframe

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
the way that would be the whole subframe

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.560 
the way that would be the whole subframe
right<00:03:58.890> there<00:03:59.160> let's<00:03:59.820> get<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> closer<00:04:00.239> look<00:04:00.360> at

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
right there let's get a closer look at

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.890 
right there let's get a closer look at
that<00:04:01.579> we're<00:04:02.579> in<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.820> shadow<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.690> that's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that we're in the shadow here but that's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.130 
that we're in the shadow here but that's
it<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.880> everything<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.450> makes<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.750> steers

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
it so everything that makes it steers

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.420 
it so everything that makes it steers
the<00:04:07.500> whole<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> rack<00:04:10.100> all<00:04:11.100> that

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
the whole this is the rack all that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.890 
the whole this is the rack all that
remember<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.880> power<00:04:12.090> steering<00:04:12.390> line<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.870> I

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
remember the power steering line that I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.509 
remember the power steering line that I
said<00:04:13.140> we<00:04:13.260> had<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.530> pull<00:04:13.680> off<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.130> other<00:04:14.310> one

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
said we had to pull off on the other one

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.270 
said we had to pull off on the other one
that<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.109> right<00:04:16.470> here<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.130> can

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
that would be this right here so you can

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.670 
that would be this right here so you can
see<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.419> everything<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.200> bolts<00:04:19.620> to

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
see this is everything that bolts to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.650 
see this is everything that bolts to
everything<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.220> would<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> rear<00:04:20.850> engine

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
everything this would be the rear engine

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.550 
everything this would be the rear engine
mount<00:04:23.360> here's<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.630> front<00:04:24.960> engine<00:04:25.349> mount

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
mount here's the front engine mount
right<00:04:25.919> there

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
right there

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.999 
right there
this<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.479> literally<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.169> entire<00:04:29.259> front<00:04:29.919> end

this is literally the entire front end
of<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.280> car<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.389> had<00:04:34.569> an<00:04:34.780> older<00:04:35.080> car<00:04:35.319> that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
of the car if you had an older car that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:45.390 
of the car if you had an older car that
would<00:04:35.650> be<00:04:36.210> removing<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.330> frame<00:04:37.629> I<00:04:37.870> guess<00:04:44.400> spec

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
would be removing the frame I guess spec

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.450 
would be removing the frame I guess spec
