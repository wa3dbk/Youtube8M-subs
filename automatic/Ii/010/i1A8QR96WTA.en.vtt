00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.350
 i am waiting for these potatoes that will be of 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.629
 a basis for this recipe we make a 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.660
 I don't know how to make a beautiful golden filet from the island 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.550
 because this name, but so is we 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.560
 put some oil in this beauty 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.599
 which we will then put in the oven and there 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.810
 let's put a nice potato base then 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.050
 I will surely have to slice more than one 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.780
 see enough detail up so 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.460
 such that cooking is not very much 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:48.010
 long and core we undermine with ours 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:53.620
 so much salt potatoes not so much a 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.690
 light oil in the meantime me 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.480
 I was already brought forward they cut me 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.400
 these onions you see beautiful washer nor 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.100
 big voices for us support over 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.509
 so trying just to cover almost 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.509
 completely the surface 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:23.530
 done 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:28.660
 a drop of oil a little salt and then there 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 add the tomatoes on top, see 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.530
 this cherry tomatoes 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.080
 we take a clean knife we ​​cut it 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.380
 simply in half and put them on 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 so there is no need to do things 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 geometrical or other serve 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.200
 simply to give a little taste and 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.200
 also give a little more moisture 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.820
 here is this we provide 180 degrees 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.820
 for forty minutes 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.860
 here is this is our pan of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.260
 already cooked as you see I added also 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.780
 of the pepper that has been ground to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.850
 moment then exposed slightly 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.100
 these little tomatoes so to the onion 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.410
 perfect we take our filippo in 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.840
 in this case we only put 1 and it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.150
 we put on the side of the skin 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.519
 then the skin upwards it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.620
 we support it so naturally if we must 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.269
 to make more portions we add others 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:46.510
 of fillets a light turn of oil over 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:50.500
 so the salt we go to bake the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.180
 Our installment says for 10 minutes at 200 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.090
 degrees so 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.879
 yes it will cook perfectly I go into shape 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.019
 here we have our gilthead bream 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.870

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:15.260
 plate a spoon and a scoop p 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.870
 group 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.049
