asked and I will go for Falcao I'll go

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.150 
asked and I will go for Falcao I'll go
for<00:03:39.000> shin<00:03:39.780> idling<00:03:40.200> maybe<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.650> tighten<00:03:40.950> up<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
for shin idling maybe to tighten up the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.870 
for shin idling maybe to tighten up the
midfield<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.420> think<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.069> last<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:44.549> would

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
midfield and I think the last one would

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.520 
midfield and I think the last one would
probably<00:03:45.389> have<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.569> be<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.840> defender<00:03:46.290> cuz<00:03:46.410> we

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
probably have to be a defender cuz we

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.740 
probably have to be a defender cuz we
need<00:03:46.680> one<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:46.889> those<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.400> mmm<00:03:48.090> Hummels<00:03:48.540> but

need one of those so mmm Hummels but

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.090 
need one of those so mmm Hummels but
it's<00:03:48.870> not<00:03:49.019> gonna<00:03:49.109> happen<00:03:49.319> Hummels<00:03:49.829> will<00:03:49.980> not

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it's not gonna happen Hummels will not

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.949 
it's not gonna happen Hummels will not
come<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.430> look<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:50.579> so<00:03:51.000> those<00:03:51.600> are<00:03:51.720> my<00:03:51.750> three

ideal<00:03:52.319> signings<00:03:52.769> really<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> tighten<00:03:53.519> up

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
ideal signings really just to tighten up

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.640 
ideal signings really just to tighten up
a<00:03:53.730> few<00:03:53.970> areas<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.600> just<00:03:55.200> strengthen<00:03:55.560> our

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
a few areas and just strengthen our

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.490 
a few areas and just strengthen our
attack<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> bit<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.489> Falcao<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.660> will<00:03:58.230> be

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
attack a bit but Falcao I think will be

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.470 
attack a bit but Falcao I think will be
good<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.889> he<00:03:59.160> comes<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.519> pool<00:03:59.790> because<00:03:59.880> we

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
good if he comes to the pool because we

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.180 
good if he comes to the pool because we
have<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> rights<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.079> Coutinho<00:04:01.620> who<00:04:02.040> can
