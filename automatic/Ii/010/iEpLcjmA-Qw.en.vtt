00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.170
 Welcome her to Alpha Centauri 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.200
 For four to ten years, planets were not an issue for astronomers 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 because we could not discover her he gave me the opportunity to do so 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.039
 to search other stars for planets 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.550
 for ten years it has come differently for ten years is the emergence of 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.690
 Planets one of the central themes of the theoretical and the watch from the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.890
 Become a victory 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.749
 Of course, fly in winter only 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.449
 To the planetary systems must be practically from our immediate 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.229
 read cosmic homeland 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.809
 How is it when a star arises and how near it then 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.630
 In a relatively short time, as it turns out, percent planets 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.510
 arise 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.400
 because the whole is a competition 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.380
 for me the word nowadays competition and that in the case it is the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.820
 Competition between the forces 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 namely the forces on the one hand lead to the planets are the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.810
 Forces on the other hand 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.350
 that take effect in a star 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 and then the star catches with her husband due to this nuclear power inside 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 to beam and weaken the whole material of what was supposed to happen 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.530
 To become planets 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.870
 and so for example is an incredibly interesting questions 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.340
 how fast a light arose the earth it's going to be like today 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.570
 fast our own planet 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.870
 I had to be built up 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.660
 before the sun 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.800
 precarious 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.190
 radiation power 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 all material would have driven off 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.860
 our planet the year 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 in many ways 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 something special so that contains something special namely 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.600
 liquid water 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.450
 something no other planet has 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 you do not have anything that does not speak for moths that's one 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.060
 there are other planets in the solar system 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.439
 Dr now 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.249
 distributes liquid water 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.530
 that has the honor of this winter Neuner 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 I can go forward 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 into the earth 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.770
 what do you appreciate now 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.819
 how heavy is the earth every day due to the impact of micrometeorites 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.860
 during a survey by Grumbach 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.600
 that was 500 grams 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.740
 up to three tons 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 some says rather and they pay much more attention 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.960
 the first rating 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.749
 could not have happened through the sieve 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.640
 bright collect of micrometeorites because the earth is growing every day 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.619
 and fifty to a hundred tons 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.730
 corresponding 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.600
 in four point 6 billion years as old as the earth 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.379
 a coating around this ball home of about 15 centimeters 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.720
 so struck "That's too slow, yes 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.100
 Niessl earth can grow so slowly and then would be within relative 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.709
 a short time to a habitable next to it apply 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.439
 that must have gone differently has not gone completely different 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.929
 only Â«how should we know 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.929
 that the earth is actually as old as this time 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.790
 the material m made from nearby planets 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.449
 have been 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.469
 is yes bring to the planet 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.399
 which does not bother me anymore 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.949
 but we may be able to find the material remnants of this material 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.109
 and we are natural 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:02:59.900
 in theory 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.810
 BZ different varieties but important is one in the meteorites themselves 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.150
 Structures to find and suggest Bush Astrid suggest 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.479
 that's about as good as safe 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.689
 So this material has been melted then baked together again 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.570
 melted again and baked together from the distribution 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.220
 The radioactive isotopes in the middle back can be pretty accurate 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.689
 set fem com at 5 6 7 billion years plus - two million years 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.890
 Percent. "That was the worst nightmare 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.480
 Percent of the solar system so the planetary 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 Disk in which the planets formed but 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.279
 to the planet Scheiber, of course, has the dependence on their distance to 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.939
 central body more central Klopp is since the star so in our case the 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:42.839
 Sun 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.090
 first of all 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.449
 Euro Udo Solo 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.729
 Dust laid yes 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.389
 So 4 4 point 5 6 7 billion years ago was the summer or even dust 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.020
 takes care and in her inner 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.660
 the protests had not started properly which led to it 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.129
 later that was the sun andiente Stralsunder 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.620
 the star was about to establish itself inside, so to speak 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.299
 yes surdu the rich dense 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.340
 really hot and at some point the fusion started and then only went the 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.689
 to light up but you just start to give on a black lung 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.799
 Lame around these substances called this dusty disk and further out 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.590
 yes, what was further out, of course 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.099
 the Elements 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.789
 the percent like us at Lord and shave will only water, for example 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.560
 important gas and so on 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 But the more you are so hot on this but of a me 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.620
 sat down again because that's important to enter from a black lung right now 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.319
 Body Kant 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.919
 the more and more dust at just just because gas was just awesome but nothing there 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:42.550
 Oh why the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.319
 who has disc 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:51.190
 yes, not widely recognized Percent 4 Brunner 50 years around who had the idea 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.740
 it's very modest no no so by now observers mean the discs 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.229
 Dust disks around young stars at three years yet 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.409
 that is something very conscious that you are now 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.749
 can look so closely and that in different areas 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.889
 Electromagnetic spectrum is not supposed to work anymore 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.990
 invisible light we like infrared radiation mobile phone 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.580
 the stars this one of Shropshire bissel surrounded by swing on set 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.419
 you still know 9 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.940
 because that means the radiation that the star already has 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.589
 Above all, absorbed by this dust or dust 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.419
 emits even in the infrared 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.229
 and if you look at the infrared image you can see that around it 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.430
 Kurt is centrally around 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.550
 the dusty dust disks are so powerful 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.639
 like these standards causal Baumberg right so that's the result 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.120
 collapses but same angular momentum and while holding the plate tribute 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.100
 the whole material is incredibly fast 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.999
 to turn 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.699
 that's basically everything 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.889
 if not turning over the material evenly from all sides 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:43.900
 fall on the star 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.750
 but so life pulsates because of the rotation 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.420
 the technically apparent and again the temperature inside this disc 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.370
 is too high 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.729
 as that the volatile elements can hold 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.909
 Vossen topic could be 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.899
 for more Alpha Centauri namely where does the water really come from 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:02.559
 Meanwhile, we know more about it but now back to the origin of the earth 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.359
 he does not yet have a distance of 150 million kilometers from the sun 

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:07.930
 arose 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.610
 and it can not have come about through the slow 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.710
 grow by the impact of micrometeorites 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.680
 from today it is assumed that in the disc to a young star 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.169
 around first 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.669
 Brocken form yes 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.009
 the island expo flakes 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.870
 and these flakes stick together, not least because they are dusty 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.539
 Munich should be so right up 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.850
 difficult market for the FAS said so what stuff certain 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.480
 un-missionary boss but it really stuck together
