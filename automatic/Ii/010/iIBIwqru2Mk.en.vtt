00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.330
 zombie games for your device 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.330
 Android we started 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.750
 Y 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.020
 the first of our games 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.140
 selection of games zombies is the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.140
 next that's called grade defense hd 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.809
 the game from the tower category 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.000
 defense as we go by in 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.489
 levels will increase the amount of 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.699
 zombies and animals that we must 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.769
 destroy in each track will appear 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.430
 these little circles that is where we must 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.710
 locate the weapons so that they destroy 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.390
 the enemies when we click on 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.239
 any of the bases where we can 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.039
 install our weapons we will appear the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.780
 value of each weapon in this for example 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.810
 stable 200 and here it would be worth tamiento 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.050
 sims how are we going to load we only have left 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.690
 100 and none of the weapons has that 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.399
 value what we are going to do is wait 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 here as it goes killing we will go 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.020
 increasing the amount of money for 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.520
 keep buying more weapons for 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 destroy 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.170
 the enemies 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.659
 but the weak point of this game of his 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.450
 graphic quality since as we see it is not 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.750
 very good but it is very entertaining good 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.580
 now we have the next game 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.170
 and the next game of our 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.110
 selection of the best games 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.850
 zombies for your android device that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.070
 it's called zombies more 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.950
 as you can see below the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.750
 game consists of that as you 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.110
 advance the time we must go 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.080
 listening to the different zombies that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.030
 they will appear on the road as well 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.060
 of the zombies every time we start 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.770
 a level will go to us appeared in a challenge the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.230
 challenge of this level is that we should not 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 listen to none of the children that are going to 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.660
 pass as they could see there what stripe or 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.910
 I heard it better and he lost the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.760
 level 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.750
 as well 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.939
 we will look for the condition will kill us that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.480
 character that would be the child too 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.739
 we have the pump option that would be 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.180
 blow up all the zombies that 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.689
 would appear at that time in the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.180
 screen we have the option of lightning that 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.159
 it would be here that while they will be going 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 would kill everyone who was going 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.600
 at that moment 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.430
 we also have the meat option 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.100
 and good and many other things more 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.140
 remember that the links to this and the 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.670
 following games are going to be in our 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.410
 facebook page that is in the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.530
 inscription now we pass with the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 next game and the next game of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.690
 our selection is this one called 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.730
 samurai versus zombies defense 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.710
 good to start the game what 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.470
 let's do is touch on the part 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.200
 right of our character now he 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.410
 will move obviously to the right 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.720
 equally if we touch to the left it 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 is going to move to the right what we're going 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.370
 to see in the game is that when we 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.690
 we approach some of the zombies 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.050
 our character go to attack 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.700
 to the zombies themselves automatically 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.590
 as the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.350
 different levels will realize 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.630
 that in the lower bars they will go 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.300
 appearing new combos that as I said 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.920
 previously you can get them when 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.200
 go 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.209
 killing destroying the different 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.599
 zombies the only thing we're going to do is 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.610
 this and doing the combos we also have 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.590
 to go taking all the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.709
 forgiveness coins that will be appearing 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.600
 as they are killing good to 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.730
 then let's move on with the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.410
 next game and the next game of 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.200
 the selection we made today 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.100
 is the next one that is called are live and 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.280
 uses 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.840
 good we just new game good at 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.730
 start of the game and on the menu 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.130
 main will be able to choose the character 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.980
 that they like but in this case 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.810
 we can choose in the half that 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.660
 would be the one that runs the most and the one that 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.270
 speed has good here will give us a 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.390
 reference to a better description 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.080
 of each character as I say already remember 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.970
 the half that would be the fastest 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.280
 well let's say you have already passed 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.530
 up to level 5 they are going to the option of 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.099
 continue on that level or start from the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.039
 level 1 of the household from level 5 to 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:50.689
 that they can have a better idea of ​​what 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.689
 what is the game when they are advancing 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.129
 in the upper left they can 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.889
 find like a kind of bullets there 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.990
 they will be able to change their different 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.289
 the different weapons that we are buying 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.509
 for every time they kill a zombie they can 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.199
 see that in the top right they 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:14.389
 will give as a balance a money with that 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.240
 money you can buy each time 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.070
 that we finish level different weapons and 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.790
 different types 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.310
 of hand weapons in this case I have as 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.560
 a kind of wooden bat and then yes 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.650
 it's like a submachine gun 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.480
 also if you do not attack many 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.970
 zombies we can get into these 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.360
 houses and as you can see we are going to 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.639
 give money or weapons 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.259
 as we pass the video the 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.900
 different levels and the different 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.330
 obstacles we can realize that 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.189
 are increasing the amount of zombies and 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.340
 what we should avoid is that these 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.310
 corner and kill us and now we go to 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.710
 next game of our selection 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.930
 good as you can realize this 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.750
 game I had already shown in one of 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.730
 my previous videos but for me it's 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.580
 one of the best that someone in google 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.620
 play for android devices and what 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.400
 good is that they can have it in 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.580
 devices with 800 processors 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.260
 megahertz onwards is to say that in 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.540
 the terminals that are currently in the 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.340
 most of the support and how they can 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.900
 realize the game consists of 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.510
 walk that we are passing the levels 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.300
 we must go dodging the different 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.430
 zombies that appear to us during 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.700
 the game is showing us some trunks 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.280
 where we will have some items that can be 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.590
 be money or weapons to kill the 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.050
 zombies that are appearing good in this 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.540
 trunk there is a hoop at the moment in which 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.700
 we see ourselves very cornered we can 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.740
 Shoot the zombie and avoid losing 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.570
 good as they can also give of 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.180
 account the game is handled by the 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.700
 Accelerometer of the tablet as you 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.010
 go through the different levels 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.440
 will increase the number of zombies and 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.520
 obviously the speed in which it goes 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.520
 running the character 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.320
 how can you see if better to grab 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.610
 zombie automatically lose 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.770
 but for a count of the best time and 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.630
 the time that we have traveled and also 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.470
 I'll add the money that we can 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:24.140
 buy improvements like running faster and 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.900
 be able to have more bullet capacity in 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.400
 our good with this we conclude the
