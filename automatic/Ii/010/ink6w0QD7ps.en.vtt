 surveillance recorded a new robbery to the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.510
 business although it seems incredible is 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.940
 it's about the same gang of raiders 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.709
 who comes back three weeks later and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.620

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 his accomplice of yellow polo enters 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.190
 behind the counter and a third 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 delinquent dressed in the same coat 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.210

 responsible for emptying before the supervision 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.260
 of the ringleader meanwhile this camera 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.450
 located in one of the gravel corridors of 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.970
 brown coat choosing patiently 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.310
 the most expensive liquors and introducing them 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.050
 in a market bag when the bag 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 it's full it leaves the corridor and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.980
 go back to the entrance where your 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.680
 accomplices are already finishing off 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.720
 visualize the cash register comes out 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.610
 local with the bag full of bottles and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.810
 behind him the yellow one carries a 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.150
 small bag with money from the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.010
 the leader of the band takes a few seconds 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.680
 warning the owner not to call 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.900
 the police and then leaves the store in 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.739
 his life is crossed with a client who does not 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.739
 suspect nothing 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.829
 to the person with the money of the staff 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.829
 your cell phones 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.870
 there is no doubt that it is the same 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.820
 gang of raiders in these photos 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.590
 we can clearly see the face of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 ringleader who on both occasions 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.420
 he directed the robberies in these other 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.000
 the person in charge of emptying the box appears 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.830
 register and this subject is the one 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.390
 he always takes liquor bottles 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.210
 more expensive 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.460
 but that's not all this same band has 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.830
 been recorded skipping another minimarket 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.990
 this time in the district of San Borja 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.720
 same three criminals enter one 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.670
 after another to the local the leader encañona 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.130
 to an employee and take it away from the 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.740
 box the brown coat with clothes and 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.960
 the cap always in the cannon to the cashier and 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.780
 the other assailant is dedicated to emptying the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.670
 box this camera records it by entering 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.920
 all the tickets you find in a 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.440
 plastic bag the leader of the band 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.390
 has the other worker submitted what 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.610
 forces to lie on the floor and while 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.290
 his pockets are recorded at home 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.450
 bed room goes directly to the area of ​​the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.060
 drinks and fills your bag with the bottles 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.280
 more expensive when they finish their routine 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.880
 always the three leave the premises one 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.960
 behind another as if they did not know each other 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.660
 it is said that security cameras 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.460
 they help in the fight against crime but 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.860
 It seems that they care little about 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.810
 criminals like these who assault with 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.090
 the face discovered and knowingly 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.190
 that are being recorded but confident 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.410
 in that despite that they will not be arrested and 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.570
 will be able to continue making theirs and 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.680
 even assaulting again and again the 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.050
 same 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.000
 in the case of the young people who murdered 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.800
 the huanuqueño merchant the police 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.840
 suspects that it was not a simple 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.910
 robbery but they were actually 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.610
 hit men hired to execute the 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.500
 man for a settling of accounts the 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120
 hit men are already identified and the 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.070
 law enforcement have announced that 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.470
 will be captured in the next few hours 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.550
 but from the theft band minimarkets 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.550
 nobody says anything
