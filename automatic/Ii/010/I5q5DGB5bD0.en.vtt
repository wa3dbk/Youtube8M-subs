the film to the windows and cut the
patterns<00:00:11.730> again<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.380> spray<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> soap<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
patterns again we spray the soap and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.730 
patterns again we spray the soap and
water<00:00:14.280> solution<00:00:14.660> what<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.839> allows<00:00:16.139> us<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.440> do

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
water solution what this allows us to do

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.099 
water solution what this allows us to do
is<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.100> apply<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> film<00:00:17.789> cause<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.660> film<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
is to apply the film cause the film to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.200 
is to apply the film cause the film to
stick<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:20.160> maneuver<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.850> position

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
stick and to maneuver it into position

stick and to maneuver it into position
as<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.560> cut<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> film<00:00:23.660> when<00:00:24.660> cutting<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> film

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
as we cut the film when cutting the film

as we cut the film when cutting the film
hey<00:00:26.039> Sean<00:00:26.369> also<00:00:26.789> has<00:00:28.130> these<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.429> squeegee

move this allows you to get a sharper
and<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> straighter<00:00:34.620> cut<00:00:34.920> using<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> edge<00:00:35.850> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and a straighter cut using the edge of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.740 
and a straighter cut using the edge of
the<00:00:36.120> glass<00:00:37.579> he's<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.790> using<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.329> awful

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the glass he's now using this awful

blade using the edge of the glass as the
template<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> he's<00:00:47.250> cutting<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.610> exact

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
template and he's cutting the exact

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.310 
template and he's cutting the exact
shape<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> window<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> may<00:00:51.989> vary

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
shape of the window now this may vary

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
shape of the window now this may vary
depending<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> car<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> window

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
depending on if the car has a window

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.740 
depending on if the car has a window
frame<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.469> doesn't<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.309> car<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:57.210> does

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
frame or doesn't this car actually does

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
frame or doesn't this car actually does
not<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> window<00:00:58.620> frame<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.640> makes<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
not have a window frame which makes it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
not have a window frame which makes it
easier<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.109> still<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> make<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
easier but still you have to make a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
easier but still you have to make a
precise<00:01:02.609> cut<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.019> your

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
precise cut because you want all your

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.190 
precise cut because you want all your
edges<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.739> even<00:01:05.330> be<00:01:06.330> very<00:01:06.630> careful<00:01:07.110> because

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
edges to be even be very careful because

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
edges to be even be very careful because
these<00:01:07.470> knives<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.130> sharp<00:01:11.090> always<00:01:12.090> round

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
these knives are very sharp always round

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.350 
these knives are very sharp always round
the<00:01:12.600> edges<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:14.220> makes<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:15.119> difficult

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the edges that makes it more difficult

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.560 
the edges that makes it more difficult
for<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> tint<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> peel<00:01:20.150> after<00:01:21.150> cutting<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
for the tint to peel after cutting the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.920 
for the tint to peel after cutting the
top<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> side<00:01:23.060> Sean<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.420> slide<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
top in the side Sean will then slide the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.109 
top in the side Sean will then slide the
tent<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.380> usually<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> quarter<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.000> inch

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
tent up usually a quarter of an inch

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.740 
tent up usually a quarter of an inch
this<00:01:27.990> allows<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> window<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> completely

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this allows the window to be completely

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
this allows the window to be completely
tennant<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.290> no<00:01:31.500> gaps<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.340> or

top as long as you can see daylight
through<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.450> edge<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.290> low<00:01:40.590> enough<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.189> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
through the edge it's low enough so that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.190 
through the edge it's low enough so that
the<00:01:41.880> window<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> roll<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> down<00:01:42.930> will

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the window can roll up and down will

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
the window can roll up and down will
fall<00:01:43.350> causing<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> tent<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> interfere<00:01:44.670> with

the window track which can also cause

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.780 
the window track which can also cause
the<00:01:46.890> tent<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> peel<00:01:49.189> after<00:01:50.189> cutting<00:01:50.640> the

notice these objects here that are
looking<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.939> fingers<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.630> call<00:02:00.840> those
