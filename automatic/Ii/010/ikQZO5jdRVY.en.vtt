I<00:00:13.590> select<00:00:14.590> a<00:00:14.650> new<00:00:14.769> bike<00:00:14.950> just<00:00:15.160> had

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
I select a new bike just had

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.109 
I select a new bike just had
improvements<00:00:15.760> all<00:00:15.880> across<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.270> board<00:00:16.299> I<00:00:18.119> felt

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
improvements all across the board I felt

improvements all across the board I felt
right<00:00:19.240> away<00:00:19.509> like<00:00:19.779> you<00:00:20.169> know<00:00:20.259> that<00:00:20.410> they<00:00:20.560> hit

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
right away like you know that they hit

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.900 
right away like you know that they hit
the<00:00:20.770> nail<00:00:20.890> on<00:00:20.919> the<00:00:21.070> head

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.660

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this year just right out of the box is

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910 
this year just right out of the box is
just<00:00:29.850> an<00:00:29.970> awesome<00:00:30.119> bike<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.720> feels<00:00:31.470> great<00:00:31.770> in

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
just an awesome bike and feels great in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.100 
just an awesome bike and feels great in
all<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> areas<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> track

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.500 

just<00:00:38.830> one<00:00:38.980> look<00:00:39.190> at<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.460> bike<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:40.330> can

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
just one look at this bike and you can

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.240 
just one look at this bike and you can
see<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.720> big<00:00:41.020> difference<00:00:41.170> visually<00:00:41.560> from<00:00:42.070> what

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
see a big difference visually from what

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.240 
see a big difference visually from what
we<00:00:42.340> had<00:00:42.490> last<00:00:42.700> year<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.560> a<00:00:44.590> revised<00:00:44.950> show

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
we had last year we have a revised show

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.070 
we had last year we have a revised show
up<00:00:45.400> front<00:00:45.640> fork<00:00:45.880> that's<00:00:46.150> been<00:00:46.300> optimized<00:00:46.840> for

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
up front fork that's been optimized for

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.840 
up front fork that's been optimized for
better<00:00:47.350> control<00:00:47.560> and<00:00:47.770> balance<00:00:48.010> under<00:00:48.550> all

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
better control and balance under all

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.940 
better control and balance under all
settings<00:00:49.360> rabun<00:00:50.080> onl<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.380> noticed<00:00:50.770> that<00:00:50.830> I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
settings rabun onl I noticed that I

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.500 
settings rabun onl I noticed that I
could<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.220> know<00:00:51.250> turn<00:00:51.520> off<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.790> anything<00:00:52.180> my

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
could you know turn off of anything my

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.760 
could you know turn off of anything my
main<00:00:52.720> thing<00:00:52.930> though<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.350> corners<00:00:53.680> I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
main thing though is the corners I

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.920 
main thing though is the corners I
couldn't<00:00:53.980> believe<00:00:54.070> how<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.340> will<00:00:54.550> turn<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
couldn't believe how it will turn you

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.060 
couldn't believe how it will turn you
can<00:00:59.050> see<00:00:59.200> one<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.470> biggest<00:00:59.650> visual

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
can see one of the biggest visual

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.680 
can see one of the biggest visual
differences<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.730> frame<00:01:00.970> design<00:01:01.330> we've

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
differences is the frame design we've

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.450 
differences is the frame design we've
added<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.200> similar<00:01:02.530> frame<00:01:02.770> design<00:01:03.040> of<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.220> CRF

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
added a similar frame design of the CRF

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.850 
added a similar frame design of the CRF
450r<00:01:04.000> with<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.780> lower<00:01:05.050> head<00:01:05.350> tube<00:01:05.560> mounting

450r with a lower head tube mounting

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.950 
450r with a lower head tube mounting
area<00:01:06.040> which<00:01:06.790> actually<00:01:07.000> lowers<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> way<00:01:07.690> it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
area which actually lowers the way it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.570 
area which actually lowers the way it
allows<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.350> get<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.590> way<00:01:08.770> down<00:01:09.010> in<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.280> lower

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
CG area of the frame and when you're

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.719 
CG area of the frame and when you're
going<00:01:11.619> through<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.890> corner<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.280> all<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.550> is<00:01:12.700> a

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
going through a corner and all that is a

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.820 
going through a corner and all that is a
very<00:01:13.000> centered<00:01:13.540> fuel<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.440> can<00:01:14.560> actually<00:01:14.680> feel

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
very centered fuel you can actually feel

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.380 
very centered fuel you can actually feel
the<00:01:14.979> bike<00:01:15.190> gripping<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.940> see<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.270> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
the bike gripping you can see that the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.030 
the bike gripping you can see that the
lower<00:01:19.540> shock<00:01:19.869> body<00:01:20.140> has<00:01:20.320> now<00:01:20.470> been<00:01:20.680> lowered

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
lower shock body has now been lowered

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.350 
lower shock body has now been lowered
down<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.400> increase<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.910> center<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.300> gravity

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
down to increase that center of gravity

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.780 
down to increase that center of gravity
and<00:01:22.930> allows<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.710> rider<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.040> be<00:01:24.280> able<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.550> feel

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
and allows the rider to be able to feel

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.030 
and allows the rider to be able to feel
and<00:01:25.000> with<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.240> bike<00:01:25.590> suspension<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.009> chassis

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
and with the bike suspension and chassis

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.400 
and with the bike suspension and chassis
just<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:27.790> they<00:01:28.360> feel<00:01:28.570> like<00:01:28.840> they're<00:01:29.110> working

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
just like they feel like they're working

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.380 
just like they feel like they're working
together<00:01:29.500> very<00:01:29.710> well<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.610> sliminess<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.270> this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
together very well the sliminess of this

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.999 
together very well the sliminess of this
bike<00:01:31.600> in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.840> way<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.140> feels<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.710> can<00:01:32.830> fit

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
bike in the way it feels and you can fit

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.200 
bike in the way it feels and you can fit
you<00:01:33.100> feel<00:01:33.280> bigger<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:33.970> feel<00:01:34.090> like

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
you feel bigger on it and feel like

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.490 
you feel bigger on it and feel like
you're<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.420> more<00:01:34.570> control<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:34.930> really<00:01:35.320> like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
you're in more control I really like

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.940 
you're in more control I really like
that<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:39.250> like<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.700> 2013<00:01:40.600> crf450r<00:01:41.530> we've

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
that just like the 2013 crf450r we've

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.770 
that just like the 2013 crf450r we've
incorporated<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.790> twin<00:01:43.030> muffler<00:01:43.450> design

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
incorporated the twin muffler design

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.570 
incorporated the twin muffler design
these<00:01:44.320> mufflers<00:01:44.650> are<00:01:44.890> very<00:01:45.100> short<00:01:45.400> and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
these mufflers are very short and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.250 
these mufflers are very short and
compact<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.210> they<00:01:46.600> allow<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.870> move<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
compact and they allow to move the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.930 
compact and they allow to move the
weight<00:01:47.440> very<00:01:47.740> far<00:01:47.950> forward<00:01:48.370> and<00:01:48.430> very<00:01:48.729> low

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
weight very far forward and very low

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.600 
weight very far forward and very low
down<00:01:49.650> coming<00:01:50.650> off<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.770> jumps<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.220> feels<00:01:51.400> very

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
down coming off of jumps it feels very

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.310 
down coming off of jumps it feels very
applicable<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:52.240> think<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.570> good<00:01:52.990> job<00:01:53.170> with

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
applicable I think that a good job with

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.200 
applicable I think that a good job with
weight<00:01:53.500> distribution<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:54.159> year<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.970> most

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
weight distribution this year the most

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.670 
weight distribution this year the most
notice<00:01:55.540> wilderness<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> bottom<00:01:56.260> in<00:01:56.380> hit<00:01:56.560> we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
notice wilderness the bottom in hit we

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.260 
notice wilderness the bottom in hit we
get<00:01:56.830> out<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.190> which<00:01:57.610> i<00:01:57.760> think<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.030> due<00:01:58.180> to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
get out of it which i think is due to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.890 
get out of it which i think is due to
the<00:01:58.390> dual<00:01:58.540> pipes<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:01.270> we've<00:02:01.540> added<00:02:01.690> a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
the dual pipes also we've added a

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.899 
the dual pipes also we've added a
brand-new<00:02:02.320> swing<00:02:02.560> arm<00:02:02.710> design<00:02:03.010> it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
brand-new swing arm design it's

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.580 
brand-new swing arm design it's
contoured<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.750> it's<00:02:04.900> been<00:02:05.020> optimized<00:02:05.470> for

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
contoured and it's been optimized for

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.500 
contoured and it's been optimized for
rigidity<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.280> balance<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.939> prove<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
rigidity in balance and prove the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.910 
rigidity in balance and prove the
balance<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.019> overall<00:02:08.260> handling<00:02:08.799> and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.710 
balance of the overall handling and
machine<00:02:11.910> okay<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:12.970> now<00:02:13.180> I'm<00:02:13.269> moving<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
machine okay so now I'm moving on to the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.539 
machine okay so now I'm moving on to the
heart<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.019> this<00:02:14.110> bike<00:02:14.380> let's<00:02:15.040> talk<00:02:15.190> about<00:02:15.340> the
