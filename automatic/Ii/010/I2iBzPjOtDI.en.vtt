00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 the program puts it back with the last 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 block we speak direct from the municipality of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.179
 parintins 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.340
 We are at the state school joão bosco. 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 talking to students now 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.430
 You will know the project undertaken 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.619
 here at school my school is sustainable 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 which is a sustainability project 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.460
 before we know what the project is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 Camila is going to explain a little to us 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.310
 about what is good sustainability 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 sustainability is a bit complex but 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
 sustainability is to remove the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.230
 without harming the environment. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.489
 environment to the next and the generations 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.200
 future 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629
 This is the school's main project. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.390
 Senator John Bosco, we are dealing with this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.140
 idea that is already universal 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.780
 sustainability today we see in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 all means of communication then it is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 this is sustainability is a new 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.000
 system that guarantees a 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.820
 healthier for the whole population 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 good now who will present the project 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.449
 my sustainable school are the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.170
 coordinators in possession of this form is 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 the project has been around since the year 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 past but it gains a lot of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 this year because we 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 handicraft workshops at school with 50 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.170
 and 50 students in the morning and 50 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 late they are the monitors and they come 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 Everything here recreates and well if you have 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 that student who plays paper 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 You can have something to talk to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.680
 This student talks and tries to tell 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.890
 he is not sure that I even because 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.320
 our habits of today they are so 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 as soon as I realized that someone was taking 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 some attitude for this to change and it is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 what the Sun Forest school is 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 proposing that in our house the people 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.320
 There is that mania of mixing everything is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.899
 garbage placed in front of our house 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.270
 I think he trashes the trash and takes a 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.040
 window in our account here not each is 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.259
 responsible for their trash and we have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.240
 this concern to destine the garbage 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.299
 correctly is that the school counts 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.100
 with the selective collection services and is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.780
 one is a very good initiative so 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.940
 joão bosco school 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.080
 we are mainly looking for 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.010
 encourage students to tell some 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.900
 acts that will harm the environment 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.580
 but a good part of the selective collection 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.349
 party will practice dumping association 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.459
 of the parintinenses collectors and the other 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.590
 Part of us work with crafts. 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.860
 how can it be observed 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 we mainly produce is the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.269
 plastic is to produce enough in school and 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.010
 the paper being the paper people 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.959
 respect, as I think there are 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 recycled and can be part of the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.180
 imagination being that it is very important 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.129
 we look like ours is little yes but 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.390
 if each one does his part and with 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.200
 sure will help the environment a lot 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.720
 environment 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.659
 these plastics you the students themselves 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.280
 bring home can bring from home and 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.970
 some are also produced at school 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.629
 like the sale of snacks and these boxes 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.250
 of paper are used is a paper I want 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.200
 which was used in school even papers 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.659
 in reais are all people used in 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.370
 school I do not know what for sure 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.310
 will be thrown into the environment by polluting 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.810
 sta reusing what are the other to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.489
 Are you going to tell me, I say, there is not much year. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.780
 to talk about the project actually because 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.609
 How does she talk about the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.459
 sustainability he already gave much 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.319
 much emphasis on the issue of the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.510
 also on the issue of the middle week 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.699
 environment is what happened on 3 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.209
 June which was the opening until the 7th 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:32.720
 how it can be observed there and 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.810
 all these panels here that have been 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.180
 presented by the nef students was a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.280
 very large school initiative 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.859
 understanding why through an image 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.709
 from one of several images to people 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.480
 wanted to show what sustainability is 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.769
 because it is sustainability if not 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
 you have not come you will not have a 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.449
 tremendous progress and was very willing 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.190
 also tells us that we want to invite the 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.720
 community in general to par- 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.049
 also doing environmental week 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.849
 It was given to the parents of the school cse 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.159
 returnable né that to take in the place 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.299
 of the plastic bag, so that is 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.099
 very important not only for students 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.909
 but also for the community because it takes 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.040
 that out 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.389
 It is not only on the school wall but to 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.919
 out with parents talking to the 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.449
 friends who are and also want to 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.000
 disseminate to other schools also 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.590
 can also adapt if this 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.049
 routine we must now 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.760
 recycling waste separation trash 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.090
 certain and portugal does not export a 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.180
 better awareness 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.590
 and that school also has composting 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.150
 tendon composting is here 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.910
 instead of throwing the vegetable remains 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.600
 in the trash we put a compost 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.580
 which is mixed with soil and dry leaves 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.050
 and if those remnants of vegetable remains 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.660
 we also reveal 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 every four days and did not contemplate 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.320
 that will become fertilizer will turn one month 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.300
 and this fertilizer goes proof of our school 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.620
 that this work will produce those 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.810
 vegetables that go to our snack 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.389
 school then it's a kind of 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.460
 chain one cycle is the chef of these vegetables 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.500
 will return to the compost that is 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.900
 one more but I return to the order taking in 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.970
 also seen that these attitudes are already 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.740
 changing a lot because we can 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.990
 to have plastic bags case 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.460
 returnable that will be for sure 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.900
 not plastic bags like we 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.310
 know in the society that we live 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.630
 quite consumerist 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.180
 a lot of people use the bag 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.410
 that takes hundreds of years 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.289
 to decompose while we 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.910
 could out is to use only one that the 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.990
 people are going to use this way 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.889
 Forever, my whole life, because here to 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.139
 that we have people she takes 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.880
 that separates but we want to 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.860
 try to do a little bit to try and do 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.840
 much for our country also because 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.460
 so I think the future of the given 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.080
 unit is in the hands of the young 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.270
 So if I do your part or if I go 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.820
 being doing and 2 so in succession 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.680
 Let's see this side here now so it's 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.539
 good also in school project 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.310
 another approach and I think she looks 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.200
 bring the students is the question of 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.270
 progress we have rather that reaches 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.190
 progress and since the environment has 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.200
 both offer us so many resources 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.639
 as to the raw material we have yes 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.410
 to use but in what way 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.570
 in a conscious way, we have to 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.349
 But we have to reset this. 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.520
 A certain one because we have to 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.710
 following the changes of the world has 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.760
 is looking for progress but it is obvious that 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.050
 We have to look for this progress. 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.860
 not at any price not of any 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.110
 way 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.280
 aiming only the media center only now only 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.229
 today we have to think about tomorrow 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.550
 with our children as well. 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.830
 future generations to come 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.030
 then the school will bring it to us 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.340
 try to show that we have to have 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.620
 awareness and withdraw 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.650
 and put it back so that we can 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.940
 come to 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.889
 It is raw material Tuesday beauty here all 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.759
 a few years hence many years better 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.199
 saying the beauty wanted one more time 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.699
 thank the presence of all students 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.229
