on<00:00:22.020> meltdown<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> something<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.580> normally

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
on meltdown this is something I normally

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640 
on meltdown this is something I normally
do<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> place<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.630> Claymore<00:00:25.050> there<00:00:25.199> if<00:00:25.410> we're

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
do I place that Claymore there if we're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
do I place that Claymore there if we're
pushing<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> good<00:00:26.939> marker<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
pushing in it's a good marker for the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.839 
pushing in it's a good marker for the
flank<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.070> actually<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.460> into

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
flank like if we're actually going into

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
flank like if we're actually going into
a<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.660> someone<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> enemy<00:00:31.590> players

a if someone are the enemy players
trying<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> loop<00:00:32.399> around<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.910> he's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.630> just

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
trying to loop around here he's not just

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.970 
trying to loop around here he's not just
gonna<00:00:33.899> run<00:00:34.170> through<00:00:34.350> he's<00:00:34.440> gonna<00:00:34.530> shoot<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

gonna run through he's gonna shoot it
and<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.340> gonna<00:00:35.520> give<00:00:35.730> us<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:35.969> idea<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and it's gonna give us an idea of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
and it's gonna give us an idea of
proximity<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> enemy<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.040> now

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
proximity of where the enemy is now

doing is trying to suppress him so he

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.459 
doing is trying to suppress him so he
doesn't<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> come<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.719> down<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> can

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
doesn't want to come back down so I can

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.310 
doesn't want to come back down so I can
loop<00:00:46.649> around<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> not<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> some<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.899> lot

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
loop around it's not that I some a lot

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
loop around it's not that I some a lot
of<00:00:49.379> times<00:00:49.680> I'll<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> know

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of times I'll do that you know

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
launch out here and of course we've got

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.510 
launch out here and of course we've got
the<00:00:54.809> random<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.980> Claymore<00:00:56.370> goes

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the random up there the Claymore goes

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
the random up there the Claymore goes
off<00:00:56.730> again<00:00:56.940> didn't<00:00:57.690> kill<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> let<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.440> know

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
off again didn't kill but it let me know

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.529 
off again didn't kill but it let me know
that<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.489> pushed<00:00:59.940> through<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.300> he

got the scavenger I know some people
don't<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.570> claymores<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.470> very

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
don't like claymores but they are very

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
don't like claymores but they are very

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
effective that blocks up that side in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I believe koa is ko on this backside

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
I believe koa is ko on this backside
here<00:01:17.159> anyway<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> other<00:01:18.000> teammates

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
is looking down the stairs so I know my

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
is looking down the stairs so I know my
back's<00:01:21.030> covered<00:01:21.479> I've<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> Claymore

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
back's covered I've got the Claymore

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.340 
back's covered I've got the Claymore
replaced<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> far<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.750> I'll<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.140> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
replaced on the far side so I'll know if
