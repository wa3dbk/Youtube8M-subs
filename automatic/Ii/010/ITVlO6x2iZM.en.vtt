00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
but if the cab walked away he didn't get

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.560 
but if the cab walked away he didn't get
really<00:01:08.340> hurt<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.760> anything<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:10.049> um

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
really hurt or anything like that but um

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
really hurt or anything like that but um
there<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.080> other<00:01:13.260> dinosaur<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there was also some other dinosaur but I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.800 
there was also some other dinosaur but I
actually<00:01:14.970> remember<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.689> some

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
actually remember that and for some

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.289 
actually remember that and for some
reason<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.259> thought<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
reason I thought that like that I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
reason I thought that like that I
actually<00:01:18.840> thought<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.200> somebody<00:01:19.470> had

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
actually thought that somebody had

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually thought that somebody had
gotten<00:01:20.490> killed<00:01:20.880> during<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> these

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
gotten killed during one of these

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
gotten killed during one of these
