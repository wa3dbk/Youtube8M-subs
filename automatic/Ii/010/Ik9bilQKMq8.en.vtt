00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello hello and especially good Lenten to 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.889
 all 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.929
 and yes that's the 40 days of 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.060
 penance of fasting and prayers have 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.640
 started and that's quite the moment 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.320
 to put your faith to the test of 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 carry out good deeds of you 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 to serve others without 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.100
 to please only good attentions 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 1 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.270
 So it's a good time to re 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.850
 discover together this very expression 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.539
 famous hell is paved with good 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.489
 intentions 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.500
 you know it means that the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.480
 better will of the world is not enough 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.149
 without a virtuous action and that she 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.499
 can even lead to the worst results 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.089
 and I would also like to show you everything 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.519
 the cultural and religious path 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.670
 which we inherited with this proverb 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.289
 first there is hell two thousand years 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.629
 before christ the Babylonians 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.519
 already evoked an underground world that 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.049
 welcomed the dead but without any idea of 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.479
 fault or good behavior 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.620
 a kind of space where all souls 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.649
 to vegetate without aim 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.239
 and then the Egyptian civilization 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.119
 introduces the concept of reward 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.890
 the heart of the deceased is first weighed in 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.050
 the hall of judgments eternal life 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.540
 is assured if it is as light as a 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.460
 feather as the tradition says otherwise it 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.410
 is devoured by a monster 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 among the greeks also the souls were probed 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.550
 when arriving in the kingdom of hades either 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.980
 she joined the Tartar the place of 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.290
 tortures or fields elysed on 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.270
 place of the righteous for the Hebrews of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.010
 the old testament the dead are going to 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.600
 the school is a place without 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.690
 comfort where everyone 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.940
 just like criminal king pious slaves 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.400
 and unholy find themselves to stay there 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.080
 in silence and become dust again 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.920
 suddenly in the early days 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.750
 Bible 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.820
 the general idea is that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.980
 the retribution of good or bad 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.710
 behaviors is done in the present 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.940
 on earth if we are sick we think that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.040
 it's because we made a mistake 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.010
 and if the harvest is good we believe that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.720
 it is thanks to his kindness on a daily basis but 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.510
 biblical thought will evolve and 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.340
 typically the job book shows us 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.810
 how job you know and it's this 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.970
 character who is put to the test 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.890
 he loses all his property all these children 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 die he is suffering from a very serious 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.269
 disease among others but still 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.920
 they continue to act in just and not 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.370
 not lose faith he will be from elsewhere 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.010
 finally rewarded since god him 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.900
 fry has double what he lost and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940
 with job we realize that there can 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.069
 to have bad people for whom everything is 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.709
 pass well and righteous who undergo 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.569
 the worst woes of the coup we say that 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.580
 things are rebalanced inevitably 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.220
 other than justice is done later 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 jesus will confirm this idea well in 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.090
 announcing that god will pass the humans 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.400
 sifted at the time of the last judgment 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.590
 that was it to better understand 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.540
 how paradise and hell have become 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.239
 affirmed in the consciences over the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.129
 time our expression now she 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.079
 appears under the pen of saint bernard 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.540
 of Clairvaux in the second century 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.739
 he writes that hell is full of good 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 wishes and desires 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.510
 a sentence gradually transformed into 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.909
 hell is full of good intentions 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.799
 at this moment in history Christians 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.840
 are very concerned about the question of 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.579
 hello as the many proof 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.950
 final judgments that adorn the eardrums 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.379
 Romanesque churches we want to know what 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.060
 to avoid hell and behave 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.349
 according to God's wishes and that's 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.959
 besides this intense research 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.519
 about good and bad acting that is 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.310
 at the origin of the university 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.290
 indeed this task was entrusted 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.419
 to the church who formal and clear on these 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.060
 questions and develop his teaching 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.549
 in the thirteenth century saint thomas d'aquin in 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.040
 reinforce this reflection by affirming 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.590
 that an act is right if the intention and 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.030
 the action is good here is the proverb 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.650
 has come to us because the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.169
 Christians have found it important to analyze 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.910
 their deeds in the light of the gospel 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.910
 always in the light of judgment 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.340
 last good she is paved so ben on 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.349
 did not find them on the beach no it's 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.299
 in the seventeenth century when we start to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.069
 paving the roads of France that words 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.290
 of saint bernard are adapted for 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.840
 give the image of a path that would lead 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.400
 to hell here are anyway are 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.739
 vaunted we can say that the why of the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.639
 how is paved with good intentions that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.859
 we can not take it away 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.750
 it's just a pleasure to share 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.079
 with you a little culture and good 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.150
 mood 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.769
