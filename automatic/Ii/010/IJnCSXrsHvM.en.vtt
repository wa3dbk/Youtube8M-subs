00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.970
 i even 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.029
 Hello, I am Katya and this is a techno kitchen 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.129
 today we look at the wonderful 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.129
 keyboard from corsar 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 this is not a physical keyboard but 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.219
 it is interesting to her backlight 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.909
 the box indicates what to choose 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.909
 coloring of the 16 8 million colors 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.700
 Yes 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.149
 there is almost no complete set except 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.649
 keyboard itself with stand cables and 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:19.470
 Warranty with instruction model has 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.899
 the modest name under to 70 already left 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 keyboard and then just when stavochka rgb 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.130
 actually a real revolution in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.979
 first you can choose any color 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 backlight and 16 7 million variations 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's say blue can be like 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.179
 classic blue and dark blue then 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.950
 Of course blue and sea is very 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.470
 convenient for owners of sensitive 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.569
 the eye can be compiled so as not to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 annoy the eyeball intensity 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.009
 brightness is presented in 3 variations and it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.500
 change using hot key 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.170
 the backlight can also be turned off 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
 well, the second is really amazing 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.830
 before us is one of the first keyboards if 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 not the first in which you can assign 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.720
 any key your backlight color then 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.209
 there can highlight let's say you and others 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.890
 gaming keys in the normal version too 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.810
 could select a number of keys 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.729
 but only red illumination and at the same time 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.180
 highlighting meant everyone else 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.220
 the keys just don't burn there are versions to 70 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.370
 from blue backlight instead of red but 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.500
 Again, always blue lights and here 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.269
 in rgb version you can open the keyboard 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.060
 highlighting the zone that gives a special external 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.280
 kind of those who love Christmas trees are very 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.140
 will appreciate the more that you can register 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.690
 scripts the keyboard will be along the way 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.010
 change colors in general we will soon get to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.319
 the fact that the keyboard will be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 show some kind of animation probably all 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.370
 this goes though probably easier 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.380
 implement a touch pad instead 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.810
 the keys of some kind of a hybrid will be 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.720
 sure in the near future we 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.579
 Restrained by the rgb version of our 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.859
 look would be much cooler divided by 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.060
 Latin and Cyrillic color let's say 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 you type the text in Russian 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.690
 only Cyrillic is highlighted 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.220
 need to write something in british 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.470
 switched you highlighted 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.109
 only the english alphabet is incredibly comfortable 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.120
 it would be well or bright Russian letters 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.150
 red english pale blue or 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.760
 bright blue as you like when 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.569
 foreign companies will understand it not 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.980
 known it would be a real revolution 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 once added the ability to play 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.620
 in color, the developer thought it would be 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.870
 very well and removed her successes 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.549
 sorry before it was very convenient to connect 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.170
 flash drive bag 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.670
 the keys are nice and everything also connects 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.799
 through 2 yusb port 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.840
 in addition to the backlight, you can customize 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.690
 assigning virtually any key 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.310
 you can also create macros in general 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.769
 everything is just like any professional 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.260
 gaming keyboard also have 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.750
 multimedia keys wheel adjustment 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.370
 the volume is very convenient by the way do not need 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.290
 use your mouse to slow down or reach for 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.659
 Column controls arm slightly 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.819
 above the digital block and all the sound is under 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.680
 control as before you can click on 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.530
 button to deactivate the key 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.480
 windows that do not interfere in the games well, 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.440
 You can disable it without getting into the program 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.319
 turn on the backlight 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.060
 if you are unfamiliar with to 70 a would personally 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.730
 A review of this keyboard did not do that 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.220
 let's introduce rgb and normal 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 option in this regard is the same 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 mechanical cherry mx red keyboard 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.220
 however easy pressing 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.820
 key life 50 million keystrokes 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.979
 so much do not live in the general luxury without 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.930
 plastic gives a pleasant feeling to the fingers 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.960
 matt surface resistant to 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.240
 prints base plastic and here 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.280
 pad over which the keys are made 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 from lightweight and durable aluminum is 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.750
 The combination of materials is very successful. 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.789
 like that metal pad like 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.200
 would be recessed and so the keys having 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.180
 big move not much bulge 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.039
 relative to other parts, stand under 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.630
 wrists plastic would 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.389
 metal would be cooler 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.889
 cool lip you ask is it comfortable 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.610
 type text and play for such 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.400
 keyboard 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.130
 before the mechanic perfect pressed light 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.380
 instant response to this clave even 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.750
 forgives short left shift small 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.229
 enter and small left shift keys 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.030
 f1 and f12 let's say what else is included 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.979
 key that allows you to easily pull out 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.639
 keys you need mainly for 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.490
 cleaning up 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.320
 but also interesting that the legs are made from both 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.389
 parties apparently someone needs a reverse 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.760
 tilt or so that the keyboard is completely 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.770
 towered above the table and the price of the keyboard 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.669
 we are modestly silent and it is not yet 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.219
 on sale in Russia 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.050
 let's just say that the second one is so similar 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.580
 there are no models on the market and it has a mass 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.189
 fans and fans 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.289
 for innovation we give a silver award 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.289
 and with you was Katia all bye bye
