00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.639
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.570
 the site 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:10.049
 garden world magnus in that garden which 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.780
 may have already seen in our previous 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.720
 records now spring we only 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.840
 only the snow has fallen off 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.170
 old bushes but oh what flowers 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.210
 here the flower see what spring 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.540
 work needs to be done 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.570
 year and how we wintered plants 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.489
 showed spruce kunik which was not 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.239
 covered for the winter and badly burned honestly 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 let's see how these are filtered. 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 did this shelter help her with spunbond 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 how does she feel 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.670
 here see see here too 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.600
 damage 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.170
 they are not as serious as that tree 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.969
 canson everything is all brown here again I 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.809
 I repeat what needs to be done with such 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.759
 plant means to cut it in no way 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.540
 case it is not necessary here it's just not 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:14.829
 dry these all twigs will settle 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.860
 on them live buds of them will go young 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:23.770
 shoots we process simulator Ross 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 antidepressant this extra 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 one milliliter to a glass of water like this 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.200
 neatly here here if you can 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.909
 see here here are some buds 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.630
 even begin to burst 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.649
 and they will soon close this one 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 emptiness 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.789
 and in the mountains from the south side 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.799
 where there is more northern sun 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.799
 almost two 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.799
 burning 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.460
 let's go look nasty 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 plants 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.310
 This spruce ordinary dwarf form 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.150
 called grade not de farme with she 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.520
 growing form of such a vagus yes and gain 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 not very very insignificant only 23 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 centimeter per year 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.570
 herringbone needs no shelter 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.940
 not spanbond anything else and and harbor 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.100
 I do not need and that's it nevertheless 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.500
 feels fine already not the first 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.780
 the year we have here winters and well on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.040
 fit like this 1 more night to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.100
 colic and here it would be not charred 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.170
 only the very top of the head but it's a Christmas tree 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.950
 younger and she generally becomes 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.640
 very very fast lack of these these 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.519
 Julia Canadian rider is here 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.130
 Doug is a need for them before 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.910
 cover also I want to say that this one 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.640
 here he does not always save spanbond because 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.950
 that he misses the light last year 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.790
 herringbone me it was covered by another 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.280
 material and damage on them not on 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.820
 it will not be at all what's apparently 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.480
 even double layer of spunbond is not 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.480
 saves
