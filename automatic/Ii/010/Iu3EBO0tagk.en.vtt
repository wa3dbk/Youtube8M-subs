00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hi, I 'm thaÃ­s ventura and I 'm going 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.670
 bring you a recipe for 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
 This is one of the most 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.130
 requested 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.750
 although doing at home is good to start 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 mixing yeast 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.029
 I'll put 10 grams of yeast 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 dry I am going to use 300 ml of water 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.109
 I usually do with milk but I go 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 make with water for the little ones who are 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.090
 allergy sufferers may also enjoy this 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 homemade bun mixed with water 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 yeast she has that she is dead 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.579
 cold in the yeast is very hot 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 bush tried to ferment in temperature 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 Warm line I'll use one tablespoon 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 of brown sugar and I'll mix this 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:53.850
 yeast to dissolve in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 in a good bigger the wheat flour the action 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 two cups white flour 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 and unimed whole wheat flour 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 you can use every integral of the people 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.180
 is heavier and operates only flour 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 because if you have any type 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 for example these so the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.990
 people take away and then the people are closer to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 whole wheat flour we do not 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.229
 can lose so we lose people 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.509
 take the figure of her we pull 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 totally why to use flour 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.000
 integral right 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.619
 Let's have a dessert spoon now. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.250
 de saulo and I'm going to use olive oil are two 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.850
 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 and then people our yeast 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.300
 Look how he took a look, see. 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.110
 we'll mixing Iraq to 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.110
 few 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440
 Who moves? 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 mixed everything now hand in the crowd people 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 to soak the dough 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.050
 now it 's working the bodybuilding arm and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.000
 if it has sticking in the hand as soon as the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.239
 People are going to do it, put it a little bit 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.569
 more flour the few there gives the point 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.569
 right 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.620
 it has to remain a homogeneous mass and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.620
 that clears the hands 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:40.240
 here it is already at the point of it that I 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.690
 I will now make a smooth surface and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.640
 floured 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:52.190
 We'll blow the dough you want. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 save the open pull yes the mass 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.250
 This is what gives apple tree is what gives lightness 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.250
 on bread 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.060
 Look at making bread is not difficult. 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.570
 work is a time-consuming process because 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.240
 we have to wait for the bread to grow and 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.070
 Such cool people take a few minutes. 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.740
 on the weekend make a little 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.780
 this mark you can freeze can do 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.820
 a lot of bread and then freeze 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.050
 during the week you will thaw in the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.820
 amount your child will take to 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.680
 the school that is not late at last 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.100
 literally putting your hand in the dough is 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.100
 very good 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:45.859
 O good mass does not stick in the hand already 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:49.670
 our bread which I will now do I go 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:53.170
 put her inside the boho a little bit 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.170
 of flour on top 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.000
 o Cover with plastic film 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.000
 now part of the longer process 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.740
 have patience 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.570
 is to wait for this clay to bend 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.670
 size double in volume to leave 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.989
 rest already shows to you how 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:22.840
 It's going to be good, our goal has grown. 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:27.040
 more or less this size 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.100
 Heat, believe what I'm going to do now. 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.100
 I will give another double champion 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.110
 super soft yamaha even having used 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.240
 wholemeal flour is very 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.570
 job 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:52.600
 I will make some dots dividing the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.660
 my pasta because I 'm going to make a 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.370
 same style as the kids 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:08.920
 they like to take from snack to 6 to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:12.640
 late the mass opens a lot I will not let 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.150
 the cuddly one where you will open a vacancy 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.150
 a goal 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.350
 We're going to roll 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.350
 is 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:47.210
 O our friendship put in a way to do 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.380
 that with all the rolls all 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.750
 marbles 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.150
 look at our neighboring countries robot riffa 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:01.009
 but before ear itself but can 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:02.660
 spend with your hotel already the boot 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.069
 inside the oven off to grow 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.889
 but at 40 minutes 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.039
 Look, he's already doubled in size. 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.979
 will take to the oven to trace for more 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.000

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.210
