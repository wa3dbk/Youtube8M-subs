00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.820
 jones village and we continue on this one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 two beautiful days 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 told here that here well that you see as 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 pin stand in the house with houses 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 and fish my house and sat there 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
 spiders in the neighborhood so we go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 See if I happen to be killed 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.859
 and have some nice stuff to have the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.480
 abandoned 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.160
 yes here is coincidental fish that I can 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.809
 nice to use rotation i also use 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.980
 just at those tentacles from the neighborhood 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110
 stay 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 you see him already a great home oh oh go 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.280
 away 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 ugly wind very 3 friends with you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 my second kicked in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 and you know those ford likes and the fish here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 you can i go i also started then i can 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 good food 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 so I want to look here almost zoal 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.770
 even more chilled that monster is not it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.410
 not so handy 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.410
 yes you can eat but wimps sanity 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.300
 here it goes terribly from robble layer 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 So you have so much need in those 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 bubbling 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 places I need bit away 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 stay because that's where the tentacles come 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.600
 6 bonds may therefore be one of the most 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 inhospitable order that you can find 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 are a lot of monsters and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.750
 other dangers and little it grew in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.159
 a bunch against and even more swon 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 I actually like it like the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.500
 just mesh on wood or something 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.060
 is that many are just what 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.840
 you are do we are still on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 search for mex like that and just like 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 because of it it can take a lot of time 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.990
 before we find it and if it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.590
 really bullshit military me 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.880
 oh no there are very many say i am 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.750
 I harder and I am a bit out of the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.560
 stay close 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.399
 I want to keep growing in the neighborhood 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.939
 even more 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.750
 how it could be sweet to all bees 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.130
 to be 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.899
 these are from that argentinian killerbee 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 is the bbc that you like from that time 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.269
 just really totally piece of string 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.130
 bites that do not yet have the Netherlands 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.810
 He does say that those beasts all 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510
 day take over everything and so on 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.340
 they drive the good away from you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.650
 And because of that, the good ones would soon 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.350
 come out to die or if no know it 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.650
 seems a little bit extreme 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.640
 talk but you never know 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.530
 it would just happen that you like that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.830
 die a little and have no honey 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.030
 more it would be a shame 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.819
 and it is of course also difficult in the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.480
 summer serious chill and sweet drink 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.910
 have 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.459
 I don't want to attack frogs speedy either 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.450
 so red cloud turn those frogs that 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.420
 attacks 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.930
 that you hit that but then stab it and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.579
 Tom closes gloomy and he only takes it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.030
 of you tell you about things then off 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.170
 your inventory these are wars know by the way 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 they are only active in the winter 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.900
 and if you startled all those words skills 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.530
 a spicy strong then you get 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.440
 hunger 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.420
 according to the viewer and with that 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.459
 we also make a game but you can make one 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.019
 walk-in also just find as in the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.970
 for delivery that skeleton for example 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.690
 that something like the show can take you to workum 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.299
 no find if the iphone and with it 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.209
 ipone come after chester and 60 that is 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.959
 a very cute walking box that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.519
 there 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.520
 iphone very big mouth and where you like 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.340
 stuff 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.610
 so your stuff out and that suspension suit up 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.210
 raoul watching here is creating one 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.210
 little pig 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.720
 does not really happen that much happens 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.020
 not really much but it is real 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 look he bolder colt look we have 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.130
 so I also need an 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.830
 found one I'll go this abyss 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.690
 I can eat another one here soon 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 coating lost 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.600
 this i come too late jesus what a 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.770
 club looks down 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.510
 the committee last time will come 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.870
 still quite less t still one 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.000
 didn't want much with that and that and that 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.810
 have money but they do have it 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.650
 certain places 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:22.230
 that you once could and that is very 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:26.700
 Bold so there I believe anyway 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.030
 and so the cases that actually have such 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.640
 a miner still sitting below than 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.840
 a cap requires a miner say 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.260
 you have a big country on your head and then 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.030
 thus you can keep your hands free you 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.710
 while you are there and exploring 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.510
 For example, he piece the standard idea 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.700
 the who believe can cut you down and there 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.180
 comes then also goes nice 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.390

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.740

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.760
 where you want to go 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:42.500

 the parts you need to put on 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:55.760

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.440
