00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
this hole down this hole in there's in

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.359 
this hole down this hole in there's in
there<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.260> run<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> hole<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
there is the run this is the hole the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.220 
there is the run this is the hole the
Gopher<00:00:17.850> came<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.050> there's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
Gopher came up with and in here there's

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.310 
Gopher came up with and in here there's
a<00:00:19.289> tunnel<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> goes<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.130> both<00:00:20.250> directions

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
a tunnel that goes in both directions

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.620 
a tunnel that goes in both directions
here<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.640> both<00:00:24.000> direction<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
here and here in both direction the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
here and here in both direction the
tunnel<00:00:24.930> will<00:00:25.230> come<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> both<00:00:25.710> directions<00:00:26.039> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tunnel will come in both directions so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
tunnel will come in both directions so
what<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> set

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.470 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set
a<00:00:27.269> box<00:00:27.599> trap<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.340> bait<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.300> some

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
a box trap in here and bait it with some

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.910 
a box trap in here and bait it with some
peanut<00:00:30.689> butter<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.199> Gopher<00:00:31.650> when<00:00:31.800> they're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
peanut butter so the Gopher when they're

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160 
peanut butter so the Gopher when they're
running<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.340> their<00:00:32.579> tunnels<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.690> smell

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
running down their tunnels will smell

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.410 
running down their tunnels will smell
the<00:00:34.290> peanut<00:00:34.469> butter<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> come<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.149> try<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the peanut butter and come up and try to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.900 
the peanut butter and come up and try to
and<00:00:36.829> examine<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.460> caught<00:00:38.670> by

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and examine it and then get caught by

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470 
and examine it and then get caught by
the<00:00:38.940> box<00:00:39.210> trap<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.140> first<00:00:40.820> I'm<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> set

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the box trap so first I'm going to set

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
the box trap so first I'm going to set
the<00:00:42.629> box<00:00:42.840> drop<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> box<00:00:43.440> traps<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the box drop the box traps are the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
the box drop the box traps are the
easiest<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> gopher<00:00:44.940> traps<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.450> set

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
easiest of the gopher traps is set

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
easiest of the gopher traps is set
because<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.289> much<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> mousetrap<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
because it's much like a mousetrap you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
because it's much like a mousetrap you
just<00:00:47.640> pull<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.780> lever<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.410> don't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
just pull down this lever but you don't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
just pull down this lever but you don't
have<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> worry<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.430> fingers<00:00:50.969> getting

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have to worry about your fingers getting

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
have to worry about your fingers getting
caught<00:00:51.600> too<00:00:52.500> much<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.329> then<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.039> this

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
caught too much and then you use this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.770 
caught too much and then you use this
bar<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.989> hook<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.440> over<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:01.289> little

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
bar to just hook it over this little

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
bar to just hook it over this little
this<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> slowly

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this little thing there and slowly

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
this little thing there and slowly
release<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.840> doesn't<00:01:06.960> snap<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.560> now

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
release it so it doesn't snap up and now

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
release it so it doesn't snap up and now
you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> catch<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.570> as

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can see that there's a catch so as

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.600 
you can see that there's a catch so as
soon<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> Gopher<00:01:10.380> hits<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.490> will

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
soon as the Gopher hits that it will

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
soon as the Gopher hits that it will
snap<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.240> here's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> secret<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.310> want

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
snap and here's the secret if you want

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
snap and here's the secret if you want
to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> Gophers<00:01:15.240> attention<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:15.990> put

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to get the Gophers attention so you put

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
to get the Gophers attention so you put
a<00:01:16.259> dollop<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.799> peanut<00:01:16.860> butter<00:01:17.280> back<00:01:17.610> by<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
a dollop of peanut butter back by this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.670 
a dollop of peanut butter back by this
vent<00:01:18.299> hole<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.110> peanut<00:01:19.560> butter

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
vent hole here put some peanut butter

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
vent hole here put some peanut butter
back<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.330> create<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> cent<00:01:22.140> for

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
back there that will create a cent for

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.410 
back there that will create a cent for
the<00:01:22.470> gopher

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
the gopher

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
the gopher
we'll<00:01:24.420> put<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> line

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
we'll put it down back in here and line

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.390 
we'll put it down back in here and line
it<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.850> he'll<00:01:27.030> come<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.869> trap

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
it so that he'll come right up that trap

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
it so that he'll come right up that trap
right<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> I'm<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> cover

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
right there like that I'm going to cover

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
right there like that I'm going to cover
