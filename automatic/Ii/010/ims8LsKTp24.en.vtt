a broad spectrum that doctors use to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.299 
a broad spectrum that doctors use to

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
the outside or the back that sounds like

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.770 
the outside or the back that sounds like
everything<00:00:45.229> right<00:00:45.460> but<00:00:46.460> it's<00:00:46.940> worse<00:00:47.330> when<00:00:47.659> you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
everything right but it's worse when you

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.750

stairs so those are key indicators that

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.009 
stairs so those are key indicators that
that's<00:00:52.850> probably<00:00:53.269> what<00:00:53.479> you're<00:00:53.629> dealing<00:00:53.839> with

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
you out a little bit would be think of

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.500 
you out a little bit would be think of
your<00:00:58.070> femur<00:00:58.339> as<00:00:58.580> these<00:00:58.790> two<00:00:59.030> little<00:00:59.330> bumps

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
your femur as these two little bumps

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.750 
your femur as these two little bumps
your<00:00:59.900> kneecap<00:01:00.350> should<00:01:00.739> slide<00:01:01.220> back<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.670> forth

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
your kneecap should slide back and forth

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.570 
your kneecap should slide back and forth
easily<00:01:02.420> between<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.960> two<00:01:03.170> however<00:01:04.010> when<00:01:04.489> you

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
easily between the two however when you

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.160 
easily between the two however when you
start<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.909> get<00:01:05.000> tightness<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:05.689> your<00:01:05.840> IT<00:01:05.990> band

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
start to get tightness in your IT band

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.800 
start to get tightness in your IT band
or<00:01:06.920> in<00:01:07.250> your<00:01:07.369> inner<00:01:07.520> thigh<00:01:07.820> because<00:01:08.210> all<00:01:08.630> you

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
or in your inner thigh because all you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.080 
or in your inner thigh because all you
do<00:01:08.929> is<00:01:09.079> run<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.469> a<00:01:09.560> forward<00:01:09.890> motion<00:01:10.090> things

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
do is run in a forward motion things

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.029 
do is run in a forward motion things
stop<00:01:11.570> sliding<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:12.229> way<00:01:12.320> they're<00:01:12.560> supposed<00:01:12.890> to

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
stop sliding the way they're supposed to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.060 
stop sliding the way they're supposed to
so<00:01:14.030> we're<00:01:14.570> going<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.750> look<00:01:14.990> at<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.590> couple<00:01:15.890> of

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
so we're going to look at a couple of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.609 
so we're going to look at a couple of
decades<00:01:16.509> exercises<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.990> again<00:01:18.289> are<00:01:18.439> going

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
decades exercises that again are going

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.499 
decades exercises that again are going
to<00:01:18.710> help<00:01:18.890> really<00:01:19.100> strengthen<00:01:19.759> those<00:01:19.969> quads

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
to help really strengthen those quads

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.779 
to help really strengthen those quads
those<00:01:21.079> hips<00:01:21.350> those<00:01:21.649> glutes<00:01:21.920> all<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.429> areas

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
those hips those glutes all the areas

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.889 
those hips those glutes all the areas
that<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.090> tend<00:01:23.359> to<00:01:23.539> be<00:01:23.810> weak<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:25.899> exercise

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
that we tend to be weak in exercise

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.179 
that we tend to be weak in exercise
number<00:01:27.409> one<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:28.460> going<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:28.999> be<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.899> marching<00:01:30.619> hip

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
number one is going to be a marching hip

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.139 
number one is going to be a marching hip
bridge<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.890> are<00:01:33.890> on<00:01:34.189> your<00:01:34.340> back<00:01:34.399> feet<00:01:34.969> on

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
you're going to do a very slight March

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.819 
you're going to do a very slight March
so<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.640> key<00:01:43.939> here<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.539> are<00:01:44.840> going<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:45.619> have

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:48.889 
to engage everything your core your

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.800 
to engage everything your core your
glutes<00:01:49.399> they've<00:01:49.700> got<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.060> be<00:01:50.149> super<00:01:50.569> tight

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
glutes they've got to be super tight

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.840 
glutes they've got to be super tight
because<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.259> do<00:01:51.560> not<00:01:51.829> want<00:01:52.280> your<00:01:52.399> hips<00:01:52.639> to

leg slightly bend the knee and then you

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.990 
leg slightly bend the knee and then you
may<00:03:20.079> start<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.620> notice<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.430> knee

may start to notice that that knee

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.930 
may start to notice that that knee
starts<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.780> shift<00:03:23.079> inward<00:03:23.549> now<00:03:24.549> I'm<00:03:24.670> going<00:03:24.850> to
