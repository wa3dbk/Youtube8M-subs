00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790 
ready to rock so we wanted to do some
feature<00:00:27.390> overviews<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:27.990> comparisons

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
feature overviews and comparisons

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
feature overviews and comparisons
between<00:00:28.949> two<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> our<00:00:29.580> heat<00:00:29.849> exchange

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
between two of our heat exchange

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
between two of our heat exchange
automatic<00:00:31.170> automatics<00:00:31.710> yeah<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.130> means

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
automatic automatics yeah which means

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
automatic automatics yeah which means
that<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.300> programmable

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that they are they have programmable

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.700 
that they are they have programmable
volume<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> coffee<00:00:35.570> volumetric<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
volume on the coffee volumetric got it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
volume on the coffee volumetric got it
on<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> water<00:00:39.600> volume<00:00:39.719> for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on the on the just the water volume for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.819 
on the on the just the water volume for
the<00:00:40.079> shot<00:00:40.260> okay

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the shot okay

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.940 
the shot okay
and<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.160> passed<00:00:41.340> creamy<00:00:41.760> Libyan<00:00:42.270> ID<00:00:42.480> okay<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and I passed creamy Libyan ID okay so we

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
and I passed creamy Libyan ID okay so we
wanted<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> go<00:00:45.390> through<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
wanted to just kind of go through that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
wanted to just kind of go through that
the<00:00:46.289> past<00:00:46.320> Queenie<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> heat<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> brew

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the past Queenie the heat on the brew

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.290 
the past Queenie the heat on the brew
head<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.550> passive<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> boiler

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
head is just a passive from the boiler

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.990 
head is just a passive from the boiler
okay<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> pretty<00:00:52.579> ambience<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
okay this is pretty ambience so it can

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
okay this is pretty ambience so it can
fluctuate<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.079> yes<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.829> okay<00:00:56.070> feet

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fluctuate a little bit yes not okay feet

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
fluctuate a little bit yes not okay feet
at<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.420> where<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> heat<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
at all got it where is the heat on the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.180 
at all got it where is the heat on the
brew<00:00:58.859> head<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.149> moussaka<00:01:00.960> mm-hmm<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.859> an

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
brew head on the moussaka mm-hmm is an

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.950 
brew head on the moussaka mm-hmm is an
active<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:03.030> water<00:01:03.300> pumping<00:01:03.660> through<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
active it has water pumping through it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
active it has water pumping through it
so<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.670> gonna<00:01:05.670> give<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.119> consistent

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so it's gonna give you a more consistent

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.929 
so it's gonna give you a more consistent
heat<00:01:06.840> yeah<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:08.159> temperature<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> no

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
heat yeah the temperature is going to no

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.080 
heat yeah the temperature is going to no
main<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> other<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.850> mean

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
main you know and other than that I mean

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
main you know and other than that I mean
they<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.540> obviously<00:01:13.350> their<00:01:13.500> face<00:01:13.680> design<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
they have obviously their face design is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
they have obviously their face design is
different<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.659> Tuscany<00:01:16.259> needs<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
different that the Tuscany needs a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
different that the Tuscany needs a
little<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:17.009> petite<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.759> yes<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
little more petite but yes so it is a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
little more petite but yes so it is a
smaller<00:01:18.990> machine<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.799> space

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
smaller machine if you have space

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
smaller machine if you have space
restrictions<00:01:21.030> okay<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:22.950> shots

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
restrictions okay so let's do some shots

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
restrictions okay so let's do some shots
yeah<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.030> we're<00:01:24.180> gonna<00:01:24.240> taste<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> difference

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
yeah so we're gonna taste the difference

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
yeah so we're gonna taste the difference
if<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> difference<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.520> -<00:01:26.670> all

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
if we see a difference which I can - all

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
if we see a difference which I can - all
right<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.450> did<00:01:27.630> dial<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> grind<00:01:28.350> grinder

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
right we did dial in the grind grinder

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
right we did dial in the grind grinder
the<00:01:29.250> grinder<00:01:29.610> works<00:01:29.820> both<00:01:30.000> good<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.930> both<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the grinder works both good for both of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:48.830 
the grinder works both good for both of
them<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.590> let's<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> okay

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100 

let's<00:01:49.840> make<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> mess<00:01:51.179> like<00:01:52.179> let's<00:01:52.479> make<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.689> deal

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
let's make a mess like let's make a deal

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.370 
let's make a mess like let's make a deal
only<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> little<00:01:53.590> let's<00:01:53.770> make<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.100> mess<00:01:55.380> what

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
only a little let's make a mess what

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
only a little let's make a mess what
grinder<00:01:56.890> doesn't<00:01:57.310> make<00:01:57.429> as<00:01:57.549> much<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.939> mess

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
grinder doesn't make as much of a mess

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.419 
grinder doesn't make as much of a mess
no<00:01:59.590> no<00:01:59.799> grinder<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:01.110> ham<00:02:02.110> grinder<00:02:02.709> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
no no grinder a ham grinder the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.429 
no no grinder a ham grinder the
operators<00:02:04.149> they<00:02:04.329> do<00:02:04.630> cuz<00:02:05.020> they<00:02:05.140> put<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.380> a
