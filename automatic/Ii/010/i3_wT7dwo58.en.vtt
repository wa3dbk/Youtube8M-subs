 today we are for Saturday's classic 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:58.760

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.490
 truth that they are very tasty and good 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.290

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.880
 but just as we had a greeting and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.380
 a hug 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.380
 the cat we are going to grow 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.730
 to put the sauce that is fundamental 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.830
 that the main thing we did during 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.380
 all afternoon in the afternoon we put 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.410
 to cook the tomatoes and is that tomatoes like this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.240
 until Gilberto took the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.970
 congratulated until it starts 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.460
 peel the parsley 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.530
 then the tomatoes and then the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.479
 we liquefy with a bit of the same water 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.440
 that he released clearly did not lose more of the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.440
 then you cook it 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.340
 of the section 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.340
 [Music] 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.880
 is reading only how was the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.770
 dance see is that the caldillo is very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.630
 important because it is in addition to that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.970
 can you drink tea you put the grain salt 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.830
 and you put marjoram marjoram which is 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.720
 important also with the cheers what 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.720
 it's the marjoram mass that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.260
 for chili sauce alone 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 it's very easy nothing more tree chili 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.800
 but without the tail 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.110
 if the tail without the tail but so that it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.280
 give flavor and that it bites of liconsa the and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.280
 this the sauces 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.820
 the rest too 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:50.300
 then the tree chili in the water and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.810
 the school so that the chili is left in 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.810
