00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 knoll 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.059
 as your own dimension or be your 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.200
 make your portal 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.529
 let's make a portal 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.300
 suppose that your portal is of 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.300
 light blue wool as well 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 this is the back 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.260
 here that is like some plates all 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.260
 still adorned let's suppose it 's like that 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.160
 to disguise that that's as if 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.500
 we do not have anything left 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.750
 and when you step it will transport you to another 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 place because 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 you were walking 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.579
 here this plate is ready 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.500
 You stepped on and transported by 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.690
 example to this place is a room 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.900
 of diamonds the floor of the block of 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 Diamond 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.790
 and the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.490
 the walls with diamond veins 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.340
 let's suppose that make your own dimension 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.630
 but how to do it is easy without a motorcycle 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.040
 if it is without mods we are only going to place 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.149
 followed in mind in this part of here 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.149
 there is the house 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.900
 accept everything so they can see well 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.510
 here are the dimensions 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.510
 or the command blocks 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.650
 that this ticket to transport you to 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.100
 peu and the rest the coordinates 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.799
 the coordinates are is one 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.740
 this command console to see the time 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.400
 or something like that for example let's see we believe 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.049
 that the time is in having tried 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.049
 night or day 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.470
 to fire until the day the command is 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.250
 one 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.430
 it is day 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.700
 but if we want it to be at night only 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.700
 we put 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.120
 15 15,000 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.030
 upwards 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.360
 everything is at night 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.219
 it might seem better now the question 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.219
 how to make these command blocks 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.610
 place back 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.220
 and ready 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.220
 to get the commands it gets 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.470
 so be it hiv 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.910
 he is a man in my name is john 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 john uppercase s 28 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.709
 and 137 that do not eat me from the commands the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.190
 ready command block I already have what 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.890
 of command 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.240
 now to be able to do mechanism is very 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.240
 simple we need 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.900
 the rest 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.519
 the command block here 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.579
 if you want to do it but 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.840
 changing the day or time of day or 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.939
 night two but if only they want it 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.460
 to be transported nothing else nothing of 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:04.120
 change the time just one 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.960
 but now 202 us 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.770
 can he 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.770
 the rest 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.160
 let the two join 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 hopefully here 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.530
 we put a block of block I put this 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.530
 block of the yellow 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.710
 a lever of repetition a lever of 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.710
 pressure forgiveness 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.190
 you learn that if it works now we're going to 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.960
 put the console command 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.430
 I'm going to see the example 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.430
 the commands would be 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.290
 the place where they will transport you 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.050
 are in the X for example says 120 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.819
 thousand 20 forgiveness says 1020 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.789
 and we are going to transport ourselves here 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.860
 just and then says the zeta 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.360
 the z and the x are what we are going to see 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.020
 sides and in the middle of the two 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.420
 I would have to go 44 because it 's the height 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.010
 and we put like this 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.010
 a tp to transport you 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.170
 10,000 first 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.169
 10,026 after the place of or the 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.449
 height 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.949
 that the height would be 42 we have 8 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:42.689
 and we put the last the z that would be 11 07 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.689
 nothing more and time 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.380
 one at night 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.380
 15,000 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.879
 they saw he turned at night 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.430
 this was all the video today you know 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.810
 if they liked a line 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.810
 if you want to see more videos 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.949
 Thank you
