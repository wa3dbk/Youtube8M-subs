00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.150
 I warmly welcome you 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.670
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.880
 our championship match against the sv 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.200
 sandhausen the endstand 0 to six 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.580
 the two coaches welcome the first 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.349
 word like our guests 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.980
 Please mister black her comment to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.890
 also play a warm welcome my 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.390
 page 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.130
 what can you as a coach say 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.860
 arrived very well in the game 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.489
 we do the 1 0 with the first action 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.130
 gives a wide chest lay the second 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.590
 Of course, we are also pleased about that 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.690
 in the training worked up that we too 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.230
 shoot from the distance on goal 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.880
 that it'll work and thanks are to 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.060
 of course, a dynamic and the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.159
 team has impressively over 90 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.140
 minutes we can also go through 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.320
 Of course, that was after that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.270
 after the break is getting tight again 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 Opponent changes twice but everything 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.590
 try and then we set a counter 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 over bordons make the fourth gate of the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.579
 adversary decimated by a repeated 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.069
 foul and then it was natural 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.450
 Nevertheless, it is pleased to have a formality 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.409
 me that you put another two afterwards 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.850
 could in a super way 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.979
 Now we are happy to have two 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 days where the boys get free and then 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.979
 happy about it but monday it works 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.159
 then back to the competition week 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.590
 direction Heidenheim and I know exactly 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.700
 when going abroad at the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.289
 bundesliga relegated six goals 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.219
 is the expectation in the next 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.159
 home game the higher 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.319
 why was not already 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.649
 everything is not self-tracking 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.450
 and we have to work properly around there 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.490
 then home game against Heidenheim 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.090
 also to keep the points with us 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.380
 thanks thank you mister black the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.219
 we can delight you from your sight 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 comprehend 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.109
 our face is a little further down 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.289
 with please markus laier statement to 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.289
 game 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.140
 1000 to win I really miss the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480
 I have to say words for this achievement 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.120
 it is so short after the game for me 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 also not to explain why one 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.030
 Team so dispassionate 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.220
 weak and forward so 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 we played a lot without our ideas 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.480
 made nothing of that we have 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 can implement 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.730
 and yes I'm missing the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.890
 explanatory approaches I can finish 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.390
 really just say that you look at the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.720
 Fans for this performance at home 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.700
 must apologize and we will do that in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.250
 calm down and I hope that that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.670
 a unique slip was the us 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.110
 not again who markus he happens before 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.190
 the game player he is looking for now 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.440
 probably a bit more urgent 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.510
 player what arguments remain the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.160
 after the 0 6 still around potential 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.700
 new additions from sc paderborn to 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.700
 to convince 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.130
 So again I have it already 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.290
 said today's performance is absolute 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.090
 not to apologize and there are too 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 no explanation for it currently we 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.920
 will work it up in peace 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.960
 but I think that's one 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.330
 snapshot is and that's one 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.030
 was a single slip and therefore 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.670
 has adapted to our initial situation and the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.180
 what we do not do much 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.370
 changed 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.720
 and that 's why I also believe in that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.780
 argumentation is not much 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780
 to change 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.090
 I do not see another word thanks 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.800
 my heartfelt we are coming 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.000
 monday one week in kaiserslautern 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 have a nice weekend
