the<00:00:06.359> stadium<00:00:06.600> yet<00:00:07.560> again<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.580> just<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.820> to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
the stadium yet again you just have to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.669 
the stadium yet again you just have to
drive<00:00:09.179> through<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.690> Liberty<00:00:10.200> campus

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679

drive through the Liberty campus
University<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.110> I<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:13.139> if<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.469> take<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
University and I think if you take a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
University and I think if you take a
right<00:00:13.920> turn<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.540> go<00:00:15.690> across<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
right turn here and you go across the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.870 
right turn here and you go across the
road

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.370 

I'm<00:00:23.880> gonna<00:00:24.240> say<00:00:24.449> no<00:00:24.630> another<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> level

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm gonna say no another one to level

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
just behind this sort of sign around

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.470 
just behind this sort of sign around
here<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:32.180> our<00:00:33.180> first<00:00:33.450> package<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> video

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
here is our first package for the video

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.970 
here is our first package for the video
50<00:00:36.480> 100<00:00:36.660> 100

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.680 

the<00:00:40.980> next<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.370> we're<00:00:41.519> going<00:00:41.609> to<00:00:41.699> get<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.120> after

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the next one we're going to get is after

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:57.240 
the next one we're going to get is after
Newport<00:00:43.500> copper

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.350 

these<00:00:58.250> ones<00:00:58.489> are<00:00:58.670> going<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.879> be<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.000> bit<00:00:59.210> more

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
these ones are going to be a bit more

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.090 
these ones are going to be a bit more
spread<00:00:59.660> out<00:00:59.690> than<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.050> ones<00:01:00.230> before<00:01:00.350> because

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
spread out than the ones before because

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.880 
spread out than the ones before because
obviously<00:01:02.000> these<00:01:02.930> ones<00:01:03.260> are<00:01:03.470> just<00:01:03.620> further

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
obviously these ones are just further

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.930 
obviously these ones are just further
north<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.210> south<00:01:05.420> or<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.690> south

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.760 

I<00:01:11.030> think<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.810> hidden<00:01:12.050> package<00:01:12.410> is<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
I think this hidden package is on the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.530 
I think this hidden package is on the
second<00:01:13.160> floor<00:01:13.340> just<00:01:13.850> all<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.120> way<00:01:14.150> over<00:01:14.450> on

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
second floor just all the way over on

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:34.380 
second floor just all the way over on
this<00:01:14.690> side<00:01:16.090> there<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.180> go

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.300 

yeah<00:01:34.960> we're<00:01:35.140> gonna<00:01:35.260> go<00:01:35.410> further<00:01:35.710> south<00:01:35.980> this

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
yeah we're gonna go further south this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.270 
yeah we're gonna go further south this

not quite that far south degrees the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.590 
not quite that far south degrees the

gonna<00:06:04.430> get<00:06:04.610> eight<00:06:04.790> extra<00:06:05.180> if<00:06:05.630> there's<00:06:05.870> no

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
gonna get eight extra if there's no

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.140 
gonna get eight extra if there's no
weapon<00:06:06.440> unlock<00:06:06.770> so<00:06:07.520> we're<00:06:07.610> gonna<00:06:07.729> wait<00:06:07.940> to

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
weapon unlock so we're gonna wait to

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.120 
weapon unlock so we're gonna wait to
unlock<00:06:08.510> shoreside<00:06:08.990> vale<00:06:09.050> before<00:06:09.680> we<00:06:09.770> get<00:06:09.919> all

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
unlock shoreside vale before we get all

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.460 
unlock shoreside vale before we get all
the<00:06:10.250> rest<00:06:10.490> when<00:06:11.060> we<00:06:11.120> get<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.389> sixty<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:12.229> hidden

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
the rest when we get to sixty the hidden

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.650 
the rest when we get to sixty the hidden
pack<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:13.190> hidden<00:06:13.460> package<00:06:13.790> hunt<00:06:14.030> will<00:06:14.240> have<00:06:14.630> a

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
pack the hidden package hunt will have a

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.560 
pack the hidden package hunt will have a
rest<00:06:15.070> and<00:06:16.070> we'll<00:06:16.639> do<00:06:16.820> it<00:06:16.910> later

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.060 

so<00:06:20.570> I<00:06:20.600> think<00:06:20.690> it's<00:06:20.870> more<00:06:20.990> worth<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:21.410> if<00:06:21.620> you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
so I think it's more worth it if you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.940 
so I think it's more worth it if you
have<00:06:22.430> a<00:06:22.460> video<00:06:22.669> with<00:06:23.030> wet<00:06:23.240> long<00:06:23.479> locks<00:06:23.950> so

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
have a video with wet long locks so

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:59.159 
have a video with wet long locks so
there<00:06:25.070> we<00:06:25.130> go<00:06:25.250> just<00:06:25.280> one<00:06:25.700> left

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:09.810 

African<00:07:00.169> si

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.190 

I<00:07:09.850> mean<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.780> last<00:07:10.960> time<00:07:11.200> we're<00:07:11.320> gonna<00:07:11.410> get<00:07:11.710> is

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
I mean the last time we're gonna get is

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.400 
I mean the last time we're gonna get is
around<00:07:14.200> this<00:07:14.350> era<00:07:15.660> you<00:07:16.660> could<00:07:16.840> get<00:07:17.020> the<00:07:17.140> one<00:07:17.290> at

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
around this era you could get the one at

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.140 
around this era you could get the one at
Kennedy's<00:07:17.800> casino<00:07:18.280> but<00:07:18.460> I<00:07:18.520> think<00:07:18.790> it'll<00:07:19.000> be

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
Kennedy's casino but I think it'll be

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.810 
Kennedy's casino but I think it'll be
better<00:07:19.330> for<00:07:19.750> us<00:07:19.840> to<00:07:20.050> get<00:07:20.400> one<00:07:21.400> at<00:07:21.520> the<00:07:21.580> police

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
better for us to get one at the police

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.730 
better for us to get one at the police
station

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
station

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.570 
station
since<00:07:23.740> there<00:07:23.920> are<00:07:23.950> two<00:07:24.040> at<00:07:24.280> the<00:07:24.340> police

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
since there are two at the police

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.400 
since there are two at the police
station<00:07:24.610> would<00:07:25.090> be<00:07:25.210> quite<00:07:25.450> easy<00:07:25.690> one<00:07:26.320> is

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
station would be quite easy one is

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.450 
station would be quite easy one is
remember<00:07:26.890> the<00:07:27.280> next<00:07:27.460> time<00:07:29.100> it's<00:07:30.100> all<00:07:30.220> we<00:07:30.310> need

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
remember the next time it's all we need

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.090 
remember the next time it's all we need
to<00:07:30.490> do<00:07:30.700> is<00:07:30.820> just<00:07:31.140> grab<00:07:32.140> a<00:07:32.200> police<00:07:32.530> car<00:07:32.770> so<00:07:33.010> you
