death<00:01:27.150> note<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.080> went<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.979> past<00:01:29.750> 500

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
death note if it went on past 500

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
episodes past six hundred chapters would

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
episodes past six hundred chapters would
you<00:01:33.930> still<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> highly<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.400> death<00:01:35.700> note

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

as<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.290> think<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.520> actually

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
as you do now I think that it actually

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.929 
as you do now I think that it actually
takes<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.689> lot<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.380> skill<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
takes a lot of skill a lot of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.420 
takes a lot of skill a lot of
imagination<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> work<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.040> keep<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
imagination a lot of work to keep a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.899 
imagination a lot of work to keep a
series<00:01:44.880> interesting<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.170> long<00:01:46.790> do<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
series interesting for so long do you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.850 
series interesting for so long do you
think<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.360> death<00:01:48.810> note<00:01:49.079> would<00:01:49.290> still<00:01:49.649> be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
think that death note would still be

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.179 
think that death note would still be
interesting<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.790> 500<00:01:51.479> episodes<00:01:51.890> one<00:01:52.890> piece

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
interesting after 500 episodes one piece

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
interesting after 500 episodes one piece
naruto<00:01:53.899> DBZ<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.200> even<00:01:55.649> bleach<00:01:55.860> even<00:01:56.189> though

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
naruto DBZ and even bleach even though

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
he didn't really say you know bleach I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
he didn't really say you know bleach I
don't<00:01:58.770> even<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.189> counted<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.880> one<00:01:59.909> of

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
don't even really counted as one of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.840 
don't even really counted as one of
these<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.960> still<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.380> bleach<00:02:01.829> has<00:02:02.399> kept

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
these but still even bleach has kept

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.710 
these but still even bleach has kept
their<00:02:03.450> audience<00:02:04.110> in

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.270 
some time to do that because the thing
is<00:02:13.240> if<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.900> series<00:02:14.320> will<00:02:14.500> keep<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.890> going<00:02:15.160> on

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
is if a series will keep just going on

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.120 
is if a series will keep just going on
and<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.600> think<00:02:16.810> up<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.170> stuff<00:02:17.440> so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and on you have to think up of stuff so

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.000 
and on you have to think up of stuff so
I<00:02:18.160> doubt<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> series<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:19.960> death<00:02:20.410> note<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
I doubt that a series like death note a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.400 
I doubt that a series like death note a
series<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.640> code<00:02:22.120> geass<00:02:22.540> series<00:02:23.260> like

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
series like code geass series like

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.320 
series like code geass series like
gurren<00:02:23.650> lagann<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.490> be<00:02:24.640> able<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.150> keep

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
gurren lagann would be able to keep

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.290 
gurren lagann would be able to keep
going<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.440> long<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.310> still<00:02:27.790> be

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
going on for so long and still be

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.760 
going on for so long and still be
interesting<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.470> highly<00:02:30.400> doubt<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.670> so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
interesting I highly doubt that so

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.820 
interesting I highly doubt that so
looking<00:02:32.770> at<00:02:32.980> code<00:02:33.370> geass<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.590> compared<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.770> to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
looking at code geass and compared it to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.690 
looking at code geass and compared it to
one<00:02:36.250> piece<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:37.570> very<00:02:38.020> unfair<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:39.430> you're

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
one piece is very unfair because you're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.460 
one piece is very unfair because you're
comparing<00:02:40.360> something<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.080> fraction

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
comparing something that is a fraction

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.370 
comparing something that is a fraction
size<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.670> other<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.900> pretty<00:02:44.230> much

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
size of the other that's pretty much

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.960 
size of the other that's pretty much
just<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.890> things<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.280> wanted

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
just one of the things I really wanted

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.199 
just one of the things I really wanted
to<00:02:46.030> add<00:02:46.300> on<00:02:46.540> which<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.200> didn't<00:02:47.500> say<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:48.370> if<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
to add on which he didn't say but if you
