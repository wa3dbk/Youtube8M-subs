so<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:01.890> showing<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.840> selfish<00:00:03.840> OS

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so I'm showing here is selfish OS

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.360 
so I'm showing here is selfish OS
running<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> Nexus<00:00:05.970> 5<00:00:06.000> device<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> selfish

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
running on the Nexus 5 device so selfish

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.670 
running on the Nexus 5 device so selfish
is<00:00:11.900> a<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:14.299> mobile<00:00:15.299> Linux<00:00:18.140> much<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.859> Tizen<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
is a a mobile Linux much like Tizen is

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.450 
is a a mobile Linux much like Tizen is
one<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.800> touches<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.640> Firefox<00:00:24.090> OS<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
one two touches and Firefox OS is and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.810 
one two touches and Firefox OS is and
unlike<00:00:26.460> Android<00:00:27.859> these<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:32.480> really<00:00:33.480> more

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
unlike Android these are really more

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.729 
unlike Android these are really more
like<00:00:37.730> true<00:00:38.730> Desktop<00:00:39.390> Linux<00:00:41.719> distros<00:00:42.739> rather

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
like true Desktop Linux distros rather

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.170 
like true Desktop Linux distros rather
than<00:00:44.040> sort<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> bastardized<00:00:45.620> Android<00:00:46.620> version

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.840 

so<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.750> set<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.110> stuff<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:54.140> is

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
so the way that you set this stuff up is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.920 
so the way that you set this stuff up is
you<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.530> flushing<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.949> device<00:01:00.350> firstly<00:01:01.879> to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
you are flushing your device firstly to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.350 
you are flushing your device firstly to
CyanogenMod<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:05.129> secondly<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
CyanogenMod and then secondly to a

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.980 
CyanogenMod and then secondly to a
selfish<00:01:09.360> image<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:10.100> particular<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.990> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
selfish image that's particular to the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.390 
selfish image that's particular to the
hardware<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:16.250> there's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> hardware

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
hardware there is a there's a hardware

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
hardware there is a there's a hardware
adaption<00:01:21.140> development<00:01:22.140> kit<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.650> will

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
adaption development kit and you will

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.539 
adaption development kit and you will
basically<00:01:26.040> write<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:29.159> adaption

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
basically write you know an adaption

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.069 
basically write you know an adaption
layer<00:01:29.939> specific<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> hardware

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
layer specific to your to the hardware

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.330 
layer specific to your to the hardware
that<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.829> you're<00:01:34.950> running<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> thing

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that you that you're running the thing

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
that you that you're running the thing
on<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:40.610> scroll<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
on and then scroll it's just going to be

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.980 
on and then scroll it's just going to be
friendly

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.850 

what's<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:47.000> carrots<00:01:48.320> as<00:01:49.320> long<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
what's up with my carrots as long as you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:02.590 
what's up with my carrots as long as you
like<00:01:52.310> yeah<00:01:53.310> Butler<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.930> hub<00:01:56.299> is

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.820 

basically<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.910> table<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.720> adaptions<00:02:07.440> for

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
basically a table of these adaptions for

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.090 
basically a table of these adaptions for
particular<00:02:08.280> types<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.240> hardware<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
particular types of hardware that

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.820 
particular types of hardware that
individuals<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:12.000> contributed<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
individuals have contributed and the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.240 
individuals have contributed and the
grid<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.210> features<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:16.250> are

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
grid of what kind of features are are

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
grid of what kind of features are are
working<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.490> possible<00:02:20.930> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
working so all of this is possible is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.800 
working so all of this is possible is
due<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.740> magic<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.360> lip<00:02:24.360> Hybris<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:29.600> lip<00:02:30.600> hi

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
due to the magic of lip Hybris so lip hi

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:44.740 
due to the magic of lip Hybris so lip hi
breasts<00:02:35.360> look<00:02:38.150> again<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.410> lip<00:02:43.620> lip<00:02:44.070> Hybris

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
breasts look again so lip lip Hybris

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.860 
breasts look again so lip lip Hybris
what<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:47.090> sort<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.209> an<00:02:48.330> adapter

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
what that is is it's sort of an adapter

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.490 
what that is is it's sort of an adapter
layer<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:52.820> which<00:02:53.820> allows<00:02:54.780> bridging

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
layer which which allows bridging

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.220 
layer which which allows bridging
between<00:02:57.950> Bionic<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.970> Bionic<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
between Bionic the Bionic which is the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.060 
between Bionic the Bionic which is the
sort<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:02.220> lip<00:03:02.660> specific<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> Android

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.770 

across<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:10.910> lip<00:03:11.910> see<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:13.170> let's<00:03:13.410> see

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
across to lip see the let's see

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:31.240 
across to lip see the let's see
but<00:03:15.780> yeah<00:03:16.019> essentially<00:03:16.940> Android

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.740 

whoo

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
whoo

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.510 
whoo
yeah<00:03:34.530> Android<00:03:34.980> basically<00:03:37.460> provided<00:03:38.460> a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
yeah Android basically provided a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.680 
yeah Android basically provided a
different<00:03:38.820> base<00:03:39.000> library<00:03:39.890> really<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.160> think

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
different base library really I think

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.820 
different base library really I think
mainly<00:03:42.690> based<00:03:43.020> on<00:03:43.310> licensing<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.350> yeah<00:03:46.590> what

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
mainly based on licensing but yeah what

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.980 
mainly based on licensing but yeah what
lip<00:03:47.100> Hybris<00:03:47.490> does<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.970> lets<00:03:48.240> you<00:03:48.540> basically

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
lip Hybris does is lets you basically

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.640 
lip Hybris does is lets you basically
run<00:03:49.850> normal<00:03:50.850> sort<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.440> connects<00:03:54.650> applications

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
run normal sort of connects applications

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.490 
run normal sort of connects applications
on<00:03:55.920> top<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.400> an<00:03:56.490> android<00:03:56.820> base<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:58.350> that

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
on top of an android base and that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.080 
on top of an android base and that
extends<00:03:59.100> to<00:04:00.260> graphics<00:04:01.260> drivers<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.830> well<00:04:02.090> so

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
extends to graphics drivers as well so

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.430 
extends to graphics drivers as well so
if<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.540> here

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
if you have here

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.710 
if you have here
you<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.340> Android<00:04:05.940> device<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.600> then

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you know this Android device and then

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.100 
you know this Android device and then
it's<00:04:06.870> got<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.820> Android<00:04:09.330> graphics

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
it's got you know Android graphics

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:19.190 
it's got you know Android graphics
drivers<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.300> still<00:04:15.769> sit<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:17.100> normal<00:04:18.200> Linux

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
drivers you can still sit a normal Linux

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.949 
drivers you can still sit a normal Linux
on<00:04:19.380> top<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.760> high<00:04:21.000> Britta's<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
on top of that so high Britta's is the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.010 
on top of that so high Britta's is the
