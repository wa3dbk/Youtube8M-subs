Sarkisian<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.180> need<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> again<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> don't

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
Sarkisian I don't need to again I don't

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
Sarkisian I don't need to again I don't
need<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> belabor<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.710> stuff<00:01:52.979> here

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
need to belabor you with that stuff here

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.370 
need to belabor you with that stuff here
I<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.759> two<00:01:53.939> specific<00:01:54.509> things<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I have two specific things I do want to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.620 
I have two specific things I do want to
talk<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> again<00:01:56.520> show<00:01:56.939> about<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
talk to all of you again show about that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
talk to all of you again show about that
are<00:01:57.780> definitely<00:01:58.049> related<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> first

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
are definitely related I think the first

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
are definitely related I think the first
is<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.990> don't<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.799> point

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
is that I don't think at this point

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
is that I don't think at this point
we're<00:02:02.250> even<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.880> talking<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.390> game

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
we're even really talking about game

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.490 
we're even really talking about game
journalism<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:05.390> sort<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.540> our<00:02:06.719> feminism<00:02:07.380> at

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
journalism or sort of our feminism at

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.779 
journalism or sort of our feminism at
this<00:02:07.649> point<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.610> we're<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this point I don't think we're actually

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.279 
this point I don't think we're actually
talking<00:02:09.090> about<00:02:09.450> any<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.690> those<00:02:09.810> things<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
talking about any of those things I

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.270 
talking about any of those things I
think<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.560> talking<00:02:10.709> about<00:02:10.860> something<00:02:11.039> else

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
think we're talking about something else

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.530 
think we're talking about something else
and<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.879> give<00:02:12.000> me<00:02:12.030> explained<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I think give me explained by a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.270 
and I think give me explained by a
concept<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
concept that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.340 
concept that
I've<00:02:13.459> talked<00:02:13.730> about<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> past<00:02:14.150> episode<00:02:14.390> it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
I've talked about a past episode it's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.990 
I've talked about a past episode it's
known<00:02:15.500> as<00:02:15.530> in-group<00:02:16.010> out-group<00:02:16.160> dynamics

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
known as in-group out-group dynamics

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.930 
known as in-group out-group dynamics
it's<00:02:17.180> been<00:02:17.390> studied<00:02:17.630> by<00:02:17.900> sociologists

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
it's been studied by sociologists

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.340 
it's been studied by sociologists
specifically<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.180> concept<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.900> in-group

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
specifically this concept of in-group

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.040 
specifically this concept of in-group
favoritism<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.520> works<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.420> you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
favoritism and it works like this you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.199 
favoritism and it works like this you
identify<00:02:24.950> with<00:02:25.010> certain<00:02:25.610> people<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.120> you

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
identify with certain people that you

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.640 
identify with certain people that you
share<00:02:26.420> interest<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.930> common<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.350> then<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
share interest in common and then you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.080 
share interest in common and then you
create<00:02:27.830> some<00:02:28.040> sort<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.310> social<00:02:28.459> identity

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
create some sort of social identity

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.240 
create some sort of social identity
that's<00:02:29.360> essentially<00:02:29.959> you're<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.380> group<00:02:30.739> when

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that's essentially you're in group when

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.580 
that's essentially you're in group when
someone<00:02:31.640> from<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.000> outside<00:02:32.080> comes<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.319> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
someone from the outside comes in and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.900 
someone from the outside comes in and
either<00:02:33.739> wants<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> part<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> in

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
either wants to be a part of the in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.780 
either wants to be a part of the in
group<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.530> challenges<00:02:36.530> or<00:02:36.860> beliefs<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.520> what

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
group or challenges or beliefs of what

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.330 
group or challenges or beliefs of what
you're<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.180> group<00:02:38.360> has<00:02:38.800> then<00:02:39.800> people<00:02:40.130> freak

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
you're in group has then people freak

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.770 
you're in group has then people freak
out<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.910> think<00:02:41.060> that's<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.300> lot<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.510> what

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
out and I think that's a lot of what

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
out and I think that's a lot of what
we're<00:02:41.930> seeing<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.230> now<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
we're seeing right now is that that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.930 
we're seeing right now is that that
there's<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.270> segment<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.010> people<00:02:46.010> who<00:02:46.340> consider

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
there's a segment of people who consider

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.850 
there's a segment of people who consider
themselves<00:02:47.060> gamers<00:02:47.959> have<00:02:48.200> sort<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> owned

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
themselves gamers have sort of owned

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.100 
themselves gamers have sort of owned
that<00:02:49.130> tag<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:49.880> feel<00:02:50.090> basically<00:02:50.720> under

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
that tag that they feel basically under

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.320 
that tag that they feel basically under
attack<00:02:51.380> they<00:02:51.860> feel<00:02:52.130> under<00:02:52.850> threat<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:53.120> think

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
attack they feel under threat I think

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.850 
attack they feel under threat I think
understanding<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.989> dynamic<00:02:54.410> at<00:02:54.650> least

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
understanding that dynamic at least

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.920 
understanding that dynamic at least
gives<00:02:55.040> some<00:02:55.220> context<00:02:55.910> for<00:02:55.940> why<00:02:56.330> what<00:02:56.780> we're

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
gives some context for why what we're

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.320 
gives some context for why what we're
seeing<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> happening<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.769> think<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.069> also

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
seeing is happening and I think it also

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.729 
seeing is happening and I think it also
expands<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.720> sense<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.590> not

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
expands it in the sense that this is not

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.100 
expands it in the sense that this is not
something<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.370> limited<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.300> game<00:03:02.930> or

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
something that's just limited to game or

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.390 
something that's just limited to game or
behavior<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:03.739> it's<00:03:03.890> something<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
behavior but it's something it's a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.970 
behavior but it's something it's a
problem<00:03:04.780> elsewhere<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.260> world<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
problem elsewhere in the world the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.860 
problem elsewhere in the world the
second<00:03:07.370> thing<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> little<00:03:07.940> bit<00:03:08.209> more<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.750> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
second thing is a little bit more it's a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.380 
second thing is a little bit more it's a
little<00:03:08.989> bit<00:03:09.170> more<00:03:09.410> proactive<00:03:10.250> um<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:11.150> you're

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
little bit more proactive um if you're

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.840 
little bit more proactive um if you're
someone<00:03:11.780> who<00:03:11.959> loves<00:03:12.290> games<00:03:12.830> if<00:03:13.550> someone<00:03:13.760> who

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
loves games every time somebody does

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.860 
loves games every time somebody does
something<00:03:16.250> whether<00:03:16.730> it's<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.180> something

something does something like that in

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.390 
but there's this thing called the online
disinhibition<00:04:57.840> effect<00:04:58.500> where<00:04:58.680> people<00:04:58.950> make<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
disinhibition effect where people make a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.220 
disinhibition effect where people make a
disconnect<00:05:00.030> between<00:05:00.150> what<00:05:00.660> they<00:05:00.780> do<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.140> their

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
disconnect between what they do in their

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.659 
disconnect between what they do in their
online<00:05:01.440> lives<00:05:01.919> with<00:05:02.100> what<00:05:02.220> they<00:05:02.340> do<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.610> their

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
online lives with what they do in their

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.100 
online lives with what they do in their
offline<00:05:03.060> lives<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.780> think<00:05:03.900> we're

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
offline lives and so I think we're

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.540 
offline lives and so I think we're
responsibility<00:05:04.710> obviously<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:05.100> acknowledge

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
responsibility obviously to acknowledge

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.010 
responsibility obviously to acknowledge
that<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.210> make<00:05:06.360> sure<00:05:06.390> that<00:05:06.540> we're<00:05:06.810> saying

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
that and to make sure that we're saying

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.110 
that and to make sure that we're saying
kind<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.860> meaningful<00:05:08.310> things<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.970> other

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
kind and meaningful things the other

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.490 
kind and meaningful things the other
thing<00:05:09.390> is<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.720> if<00:05:09.930> you're<00:05:10.080> someone<00:05:10.350> who

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
thing is that if you're someone who

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.590 
thing is that if you're someone who
wants<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.280> be<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> part<00:05:11.820> of<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.419> this
