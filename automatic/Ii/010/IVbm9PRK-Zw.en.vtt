about<00:00:11.040> fertilizers<00:00:11.730> anymore<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.840> there<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
about fertilizers anymore that there is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.369 
about fertilizers anymore that there is
some<00:00:14.820> discussion<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.900> get<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> use

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
some discussion I'm going to get to use

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
some discussion I'm going to get to use
sand<00:00:16.740> or<00:00:16.859> gravel<00:00:17.039> now<00:00:17.430> from<00:00:17.670> my<00:00:17.850> experience<00:00:18.449> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
sand or gravel now from my experience I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290 
sand or gravel now from my experience I
would<00:00:18.720> definitely<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:19.949> gravel<00:00:20.520> because

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
would definitely go with gravel because

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
would definitely go with gravel because
first<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> explain<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.369> slang<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> roots<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
first to explain the slang the roots of

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.839 
first to explain the slang the roots of
the<00:00:26.189> plant<00:00:26.460> stated<00:00:26.869> brief<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.730> Samson<00:00:29.730> really

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the plant stated brief and Samson really

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
the plant stated brief and Samson really
loud<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.449> doesn't<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.900> allow<00:00:31.140> oxygen

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
loud that doesn't really allow oxygen

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.340 
loud that doesn't really allow oxygen
into<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> substrate<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> plus<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
into the substrate so then the plus the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040 
into the substrate so then the plus the
car<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.770> grow<00:00:35.219> very<00:00:35.550> well<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> won't

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
car really grow very well so you won't

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
car really grow very well so you won't
get<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.530> know<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> greatest<00:00:38.280> growth<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.670> your

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
get you know the greatest growth in your

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.600 
get you know the greatest growth in your
plants<00:00:39.440> also<00:00:40.440> nitrogen<00:00:40.710> gases<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.399> get

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
plants also nitrogen gases they get

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.549 
plants also nitrogen gases they get
trapped<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> sand<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.410> they

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
trapped into the sand and then as they

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
trapped into the sand and then as they
build<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.340> released<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.020> that's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
build up they get released and that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.430 
build up they get released and that's
not<00:00:46.260> very<00:00:46.440> healthy<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.890> Aggie<00:00:47.250> aquarium<00:00:48.440> plus

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
not very healthy for Aggie aquarium plus

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.729 
not very healthy for Aggie aquarium plus
it's<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.340> messy<00:00:50.930> whatever<00:00:51.930> comes<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.469> will

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it's pretty messy whatever comes up will

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's pretty messy whatever comes up will
just<00:00:52.949> fall<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.430> top<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> sand<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:56.449> mean

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
just fall on top of the sand and I mean

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.439 
just fall on top of the sand and I mean
it's<00:00:57.600> great<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.020> corridors<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:59.449> whatever

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it's great for corridors but whatever

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
it's great for corridors but whatever
comes<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.350> why<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> kept<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
comes up like that's why I kept it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
comes up like that's why I kept it
really<00:01:02.910> thick<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.539> doesn't<00:01:03.930> look<00:01:04.019> very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
really thick which doesn't look very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.830 
really thick which doesn't look very

sorry memories really messy ocean and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.070 
sorry memories really messy ocean and
this<00:01:17.549> term<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.060> doing<00:01:18.479> great<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.750> kind<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
this term is doing great it's kind of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.130 
this term is doing great it's kind of
foggy<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.759> put<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.479> saw

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
foggy because I put this in it I saw

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
foggy because I put this in it I saw
some<00:01:22.409> algae<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.220> plant<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.570> going

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
some algae going the plant so I'm going

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.030 
some algae going the plant so I'm going
to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> before<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to get it before it got too out of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.060 
to get it before it got too out of
control<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> caught<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.630> bit

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
control just kind of caught me bit

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.569 
control just kind of caught me bit
thinking<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
thinking like that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
thinking like that
the<00:01:30.090> thing<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.420> gravel<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> allow

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the thing with gravel is that it allow

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.880 
the thing with gravel is that it allow
allows<00:01:32.400> oxygen<00:01:32.780> into<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> substrate<00:01:34.350> into

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
allows oxygen into the substrate into

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
allows oxygen into the substrate into
the<00:01:34.979> dirt<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> roots<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> grow

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the dirt and so the roots get to grow

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.010 
the dirt and so the roots get to grow
really<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.570> hard<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> see

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really well so it's kind of hard to see

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
really well so it's kind of hard to see
because<00:01:40.079> it'll<00:01:40.380> fall<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.579> plants<00:01:41.939> are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
because it'll fall get these plants are

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
because it'll fall get these plants are
actually<00:01:42.329> pretty<00:01:42.630> green<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:44.689> they're

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually pretty green and they're

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.749 
actually pretty green and they're
rooting<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.560> well<00:01:47.270> let<00:01:48.270> me<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.540> Trey<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
rooting really well let me just Trey I

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
rooting really well let me just Trey I
don't<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
don't know if you can see there we go to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.910 
don't know if you can see there we go to
the<00:01:52.380> roots<00:01:52.530> though<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.619> nice

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the roots though so that's really nice

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.550 
the roots though so that's really nice
and

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.469 
and
when<00:01:57.860> any<00:01:58.100> dirt<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.670> comes<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:59.150> like<00:01:59.330> that

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
when any dirt that comes up like that

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.980 
when any dirt that comes up like that
say<00:01:59.720> there's<00:01:59.930> still<00:01:59.990> some<00:02:00.380> air<00:02:00.650> as<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.070> are

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
say there's still some air as you are

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.120 
say there's still some air as you are
when<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.080> were<00:02:03.200> capping<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.740> filling<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.040> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
when you were capping and filling up the

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
time TV chatroom and they came up with I

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.470 
time TV chatroom and they came up with I
could<00:03:10.670> cover<00:03:11.630> most<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.320> with<00:03:12.530> gravel<00:03:12.799> with

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
could cover most of it with gravel with

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.270 
could cover most of it with gravel with
comfortable<00:03:14.480> gravel<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.230> could<00:03:15.380> say<00:03:15.560> but

comfortable gravel you could say but
then<00:03:16.489> as<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.940> was<00:03:17.090> experimenting<00:03:17.450> how<00:03:17.840> how<00:03:18.019> it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
then as I was experimenting how how it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.259 
then as I was experimenting how how it
would<00:03:18.290> look<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.530> have<00:03:18.680> an<00:03:18.799> area<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.250> sand<00:03:19.640> I'm

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
would look I have an area of sand I'm

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.000 
would look I have an area of sand I'm
going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> kind<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:20.900> buy<00:03:21.440> some<00:03:21.650> more<00:03:21.799> rocks

going to kind of buy some more rocks
with<00:03:22.160> my<00:03:22.250> sister<00:03:22.549> days<00:03:22.670> if<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.910> my<00:03:23.030> sister<00:03:23.799> kind

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
with my sister days if I my sister kind

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.819 
with my sister days if I my sister kind
of<00:03:24.920> swirl<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.670> looks<00:03:25.820> interesting<00:03:26.829> we

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
of swirl it so it looks interesting we

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.220 
of swirl it so it looks interesting we
could<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> beach<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.880> then<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:30.079> to

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
could be like a beach and then I get to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.250 
could be like a beach and then I get to
still<00:03:30.470> watch<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.859> corridors<00:03:31.340> plain<00:03:31.640> sand

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
still watch the corridors plain sand

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.289 
still watch the corridors plain sand
they<00:03:33.260> get<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.769> be<00:03:33.890> happy<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> then<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.000> plants

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
they get to be happy and then the plants

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.960 
they get to be happy and then the plants
get<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.540> grow<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.380> I'll<00:03:36.650> out<00:03:36.859> in<00:03:37.130> return<00:03:37.700> who

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
get to grow and I'll out in return who

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.050 
get to grow and I'll out in return who
make<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.329> healthy<00:03:38.720> aquarium<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:40.820> my

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
make a healthy aquarium so that's my

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.949 
make a healthy aquarium so that's my
idea<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.890> that's<00:03:42.890> what<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.100> think<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.959> sand

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
idea and that's what I think of sand

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.650 
idea and that's what I think of sand
versus<00:03:45.350> gravel<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.920> think<00:03:46.250> sad<00:03:46.459> sucks<00:03:46.850> but<00:03:47.570> if

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
versus gravel I think sad sucks but if

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.000 
versus gravel I think sad sucks but if
they<00:03:47.780> are<00:03:47.870> corridors<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.500> should<00:03:48.769> have<00:03:48.890> at

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
they are corridors you should have at

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.400 
they are corridors you should have at
least<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.310> little<00:03:49.370> bit<00:03:49.489> because<00:03:50.170> look<00:03:51.170> how<00:03:51.260> much

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
least a little bit because look how much

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.780 
least a little bit because look how much
fun<00:03:51.590> they<00:03:51.680> have

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.759 

so<00:03:55.790> those<00:03:56.420> are<00:03:56.569> my<00:03:56.629> thoughts<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.439> my

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
so those are my thoughts on that and my

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.530
