00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello very good everyone I'm picture 3 if 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.040
 I bring a new video and well I am 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.650
 extreme second easter egg course 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.389
 guardian and as you see to be able to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 this easter egg we have to have 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.119
 unlocked the repercussions campaign 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:25.470
 and put act 3 once we put the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 act 3 we have to say pass us the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.859
 parts of where you have to put a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.790
 mask is worth here we see that he takes it off 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.610
 now the most expensive 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.830
 there he says it and we just went through the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.010
 door where I'm going now 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.500
 same is worth nothing else because we raise the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.590
 stairs and very important do not touch 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.780
 no button because if you play any 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.450
 button I think who can be done 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.650
 be good then 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.010
 we enter we go by teams the second 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.290
 door and as I told you before here 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.180
 there are buttons do not touch them because I think 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.630
 that if you touch them you can not do it 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 ok then we just went out 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.170
 this window and as you can see there we have a 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.229
 crane and here a scene and per vale 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.350
 we take the sniper and the only thing we have 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.810
 what to do is shoot at the mini lambent 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.720
 that we have in the crane that is fixed and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.200
 moves is there as dancing or something 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.680
 similar 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 then we shot him and fixed what 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.200
 it happens a river appears 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.920
 do not attack anything like that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.330
 but it starts to draw 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.400
 two letters there in the sky that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 basically what he says is hello is in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.259
 English is good and well, this has been 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 another easter egg on the part of people 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.850
 can fly epic games so nothing if you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.200

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.200
