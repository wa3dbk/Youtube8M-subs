yards<00:06:00.830> out<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.640> just<00:06:02.450> had<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.750> kind<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.230> use

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
yards out so I just had to kind of use

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.440 
yards out so I just had to kind of use
the<00:06:04.280> inside<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:04.700> my<00:06:04.760> foot<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.030> just<00:06:05.270> knock<00:06:05.420> it

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
the inside of my foot and just knock it

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.050 
the inside of my foot and just knock it
right<00:06:05.750> over<00:06:06.020> her<00:06:06.140> head<00:06:06.350> into<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.860> open<00:06:07.610> net<00:06:07.730> so

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
right over her head into the open net so

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.880 
right over her head into the open net so
but<00:06:08.750> it's<00:06:09.290> something<00:06:09.620> that<00:06:09.740> I've<00:06:09.860> been

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
but it's something that I've been

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.590 
but it's something that I've been
working<00:06:10.310> I<00:06:10.400> could<00:06:10.580> usually<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.970> would<00:06:11.120> just<00:06:11.300> sky

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
working I could usually I would just sky

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.650 
working I could usually I would just sky
that<00:06:11.840> right<00:06:12.050> over<00:06:12.350> but<00:06:12.680> I<00:06:13.210> figured<00:06:14.210> in<00:06:14.360> my<00:06:14.450> game

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
that right over but I figured in my game

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.420 
that right over but I figured in my game
as<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:15.170> finishers<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.860> just<00:06:16.040> have<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.220> stay

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
as a finishers I just have to stay

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.850 
as a finishers I just have to stay
relaxed<00:06:16.970> in<00:06:17.240> front<00:06:17.510> of<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.690> net<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.590> think

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
relaxed in front of the net and I think

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.960 
relaxed in front of the net and I think
that's<00:06:19.010> what<00:06:19.130> I<00:06:19.160> did<00:06:19.340> especially<00:06:19.520> on<00:06:19.820> that

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
that's what I did especially on that

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:29.920 
that's what I did especially on that
second<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:28.760> know<00:06:28.850> pure<00:06:29.150> strength<00:06:29.630> and

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
second you know pure strength and

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.270 
second you know pure strength and
emotion<00:06:30.410> on<00:06:30.590> it

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
emotion on it

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.830 
emotion on it
that's<00:06:31.580> just<00:06:31.880> picturing<00:06:32.210> as<00:06:32.390> a<00:06:32.420> player<00:06:32.720> I

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
that's just picturing as a player I

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.040 
that's just picturing as a player I
think<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:35.090> was<00:06:35.240> really<00:06:35.510> good<00:06:35.660> I<00:06:35.690> think<00:06:35.900> that's

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
think it was really good I think that's

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.540 
think it was really good I think that's
something<00:06:36.200> that<00:06:36.350> we've<00:06:36.620> been<00:06:36.770> really<00:06:37.040> working

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
something that we've been really working

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.580 
something that we've been really working
on<00:06:37.880> it<00:06:38.120> when<00:06:38.450> we<00:06:38.540> were<00:06:38.660> training<00:06:38.930> out<00:06:39.110> in<00:06:39.230> LA

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
on it when we were training out in LA

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.810 
on it when we were training out in LA
and<00:06:39.830> now<00:06:39.980> that<00:06:40.160> we've<00:06:40.250> been<00:06:40.370> training<00:06:40.640> here<00:06:40.730> in

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
and now that we've been training here in

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.840 
and now that we've been training here in
Portugal<00:06:41.290> and<00:06:42.290> sometimes<00:06:43.190> I<00:06:43.310> practice<00:06:43.670> it's

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
Portugal and sometimes I practice it's

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.370 
Portugal and sometimes I practice it's
been<00:06:43.970> frustrating<00:06:44.540> because<00:06:44.630> we<00:06:44.840> felt<00:06:45.080> like<00:06:45.140> we

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
been frustrating because we felt like we

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.560 
been frustrating because we felt like we
haven't<00:06:45.710> gotten<00:06:46.190> that<00:06:46.340> rhythm<00:06:46.670> down<00:06:46.910> but<00:06:47.210> but

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
haven't gotten that rhythm down but but

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.630 
haven't gotten that rhythm down but but
to<00:06:47.840> have<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:48.110> game<00:06:48.290> like<00:06:48.320> today<00:06:48.770> and<00:06:49.010> we<00:06:49.550> were

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
to have a game like today and we were

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.760 
to have a game like today and we were
really<00:06:49.790> reading<00:06:50.180> each<00:06:50.270> other<00:06:50.450> well<00:06:50.660> and<00:06:50.770> the

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
really reading each other well and the

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.560 
really reading each other well and the
game<00:06:52.310> shows<00:06:52.670> that<00:06:52.790> the<00:06:52.910> results<00:06:53.270> shows<00:06:53.390> with

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
game shows that the results shows with

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.660 
game shows that the results shows with
