now<00:00:54.469> wow<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.739> looks<00:00:55.949> great

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.060 

this<00:01:03.700> particular<00:01:04.060> bottom<00:01:04.630> of<00:01:04.810> shell<00:01:05.110> might<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
this particular bottom of shell might a

this particular bottom of shell might a
little<00:01:06.370> bit<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.580> Seine<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.510> just<00:01:07.810> teeming<00:01:08.140> with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
little bit of Seine is just teeming with

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.160 
little bit of Seine is just teeming with
life<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.340> often<00:01:09.940> you'll<00:01:10.090> find<00:01:10.150> flounder<00:01:10.930> just

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
life and often you'll find flounder just

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.830 
life and often you'll find flounder just
laying<00:01:11.590> in<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.130> sand<00:01:12.430> edges<00:01:13.090> between<00:01:13.360> the

shells during the daytime they bury

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.720 
shells during the daytime they bury
themselves<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:17.560> they're<00:01:17.710> very<00:01:18.070> difficult<00:01:18.370> to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
themselves so they're very difficult to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.600 
themselves so they're very difficult to
stop<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:20.080> at<00:01:20.200> night<00:01:20.410> with<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.890> good<00:01:21.130> flounder

it's gone beautiful in Cambria as we

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.900 
it's gone beautiful in Cambria as we
slowly<00:01:53.140> walked<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.979> river<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.550> bottom

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
the mud the more flounder we were

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.719 
the mud the more flounder we were
spotting<00:02:05.970> then<00:02:07.110> finally<00:02:08.110> after<00:02:08.729> startling

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
spotting then finally after startling

spotting then finally after startling
about<00:02:10.000> 80<00:02:10.300> flounder<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:12.550> spot<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.000> before<00:02:13.750> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
about 80 flounder we spot one before it

about 80 flounder we spot one before it
spots<00:02:14.410> us<00:02:15.390> you'll<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.750> excuse<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320

spots us you'll have to excuse the
shanky<00:02:17.890> camerawork<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.990> pull<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.620> tripod

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
shanky camerawork I then pull the tripod

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.270 
shanky camerawork I then pull the tripod
out<00:02:21.580> I'm<00:02:22.030> sure<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:23.500> would<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.650> startled<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
out I'm sure it would have startled the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.050 
out I'm sure it would have startled the
fish<00:02:24.520> if<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.970> had<00:02:25.090> touched<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.540> ground<00:02:30.060> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
fish if it had touched the ground you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.480 
fish if it had touched the ground you
can<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.270> how<00:02:31.660> soft<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.200> matters<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.010> fish<00:02:33.310> is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
can see how soft the matters the fish is

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.380 
can see how soft the matters the fish is
well<00:02:33.940> buried<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.590> move<00:02:35.830> closer<00:02:36.390> just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
well buried and then I move closer just

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.350 
well buried and then I move closer just
to<00:02:37.630> see<00:02:37.840> how<00:02:38.170> close<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.740> can<00:02:38.890> get<00:02:39.130> before<00:02:39.760> it

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
to see how close we can get before it

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.650 
to see how close we can get before it
bolt

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.810 

in<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.930> few<00:02:45.230> seconds<00:02:45.680> we'll<00:02:46.130> go<00:02:46.310> flounder

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
in a few seconds we'll go flounder

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.480 
in a few seconds we'll go flounder
gigging<00:02:47.180> at<00:02:47.330> night<00:02:47.540> but<00:02:48.320> first<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:49.070> would<00:02:49.460> like

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
gigging at night but first I would like

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.740 
gigging at night but first I would like
to<00:02:49.760> tell<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> little<00:02:50.240> about<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.720> new

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
to tell you a little about the new

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.810 
to tell you a little about the new
flounder<00:02:51.470> gigging<00:02:51.800> lights<00:02:52.010> we're<00:02:52.310> using

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
flounder gigging lights we're using

using it in the water or out of the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.820 
using it in the water or out of the

I<00:03:49.850> prefer<00:03:50.450> running<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.020> light<00:03:51.230> immersed

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
I prefer running the light immersed

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.790 
I prefer running the light immersed
under<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.550> water<00:03:53.080> because<00:03:54.080> what<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.530> does

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
under the water because what this does

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.190 
under the water because what this does
is<00:03:55.040> traps<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.180> light<00:03:56.390> rays<00:03:56.690> between

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
is traps all of the light rays between

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.740 
is traps all of the light rays between
the<00:03:57.350> surface<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.190> bottom<00:03:58.430> any<00:03:59.360> lost

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the surface and the bottom any lost

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.140 
the surface and the bottom any lost
light<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.350> reflected<00:04:01.040> back<00:04:01.310> off<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.670> surface

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
light is reflected back off the surface

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.250 
light is reflected back off the surface
and<00:04:02.360> comes<00:04:02.870> down<00:04:03.020> quite<00:04:03.770> some<00:04:04.100> distance<00:04:04.280> away

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
and comes down quite some distance away

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.200 
and comes down quite some distance away
this<00:04:06.260> means<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.130> see<00:04:07.430> much<00:04:07.940> further

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
this means that you can see much further

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.110 
this means that you can see much further
than<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.750> otherwise<00:04:08.900> would<00:04:09.170> if<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.790> water's

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120

dirty<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:12.080> lights<00:04:12.320> actually<00:04:12.590> operate<00:04:13.430> better

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
dirty the lights actually operate better
