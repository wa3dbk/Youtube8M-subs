on<00:00:46.500> our<00:00:46.770> wax<00:00:46.980> paper<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.850> covering<00:00:48.660> our

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
on our wax paper which is covering our

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.310 
on our wax paper which is covering our
template<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
template just so that we make sure that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.100 
template just so that we make sure that
it<00:00:52.649> doesn't<00:00:52.980> slip<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.699> we're<00:00:53.989> making<00:00:54.989> our

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it doesn't slip when we're making our

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
it doesn't slip when we're making our
snowflakes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.400 

you're<00:01:12.970> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.150> pour<00:01:13.390> some<00:01:13.450> your<00:01:13.840> sprinkles

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
you're going to pour some your sprinkles

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.410 
you're going to pour some your sprinkles
and<00:01:14.800> so<00:01:15.370> they're<00:01:15.490> easier<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:17.050> get<00:01:17.260> out<00:01:18.420> when

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
and so they're easier to get out when

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.330 
and so they're easier to get out when
you<00:01:19.690> are<00:01:20.700> making<00:01:21.700> your<00:01:21.880> snowflakes<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:24.190> then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
you are making your snowflakes and then

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.370 
you are making your snowflakes and then
we're<00:01:24.550> going<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.730> pour<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.150> candy<00:01:25.540> melts<00:01:25.660> in

we're going to pour the candy melts in
your<00:01:26.440> Pyrex<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.260> to<00:01:32.290> melt<00:01:32.560> them

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
your Pyrex and we're going to melt them

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.950 
your Pyrex and we're going to melt them
in<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:32.980> microwave<00:01:33.480> you're<00:01:34.480> going<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.690> melt

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
in the microwave you're going to melt

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.240 
in the microwave you're going to melt
them<00:01:35.170> for<00:01:35.530> one<00:01:35.770> minute<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.480> low<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:38.530> defrost

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.600 
them for one minute on low or defrost
and<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:40.540> stir<00:01:40.990> them<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:42.340> you're<00:01:42.490> going

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
and then stir them and then you're going

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.390 
and then stir them and then you're going
to<00:01:42.670> melt<00:01:42.970> them<00:01:43.270> at<00:01:43.660> 15<00:01:44.410> to<00:01:44.590> 30<00:01:44.830> second

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
to melt them at 15 to 30 second

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.910 
to melt them at 15 to 30 second
increments<00:01:46.170> until<00:01:47.170> they<00:01:47.410> are<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.770> right

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
increments until they are the right

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.760 
increments until they are the right
consistency<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.020> can<00:01:50.170> pour<00:01:50.470> them<00:01:50.650> in

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
consistency so that you can pour them in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.590 
consistency so that you can pour them in
your<00:01:50.890> squeeze<00:01:51.220> bottle<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.910> they're<00:01:52.090> melted

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
your squeeze bottle and they're melted

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.320 
your squeeze bottle and they're melted
completely<00:01:52.780> without<00:01:53.500> over<00:01:53.979> melting<00:01:54.430> them<00:01:54.610> so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
completely without over melting them so

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:16.310 
completely without over melting them so
let's<00:01:55.600> start<00:01:55.930> with<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> minute

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.780 

you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.500> tell<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.890> chocolates<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.700> be

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you can tell the chocolates need to be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.340 
you can tell the chocolates need to be
melted<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.300> bit<00:02:19.570> longer<00:02:19.990> because

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
melted a little bit longer because

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.790 
melted a little bit longer because
they're<00:02:20.770> not<00:02:21.060> melting<00:02:22.060> as<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.450> stir<00:02:22.750> them<00:02:22.990> so

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
they're not melting as you stir them so

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.590 
they're not melting as you stir them so
I'm<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> put<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.580> back<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.360> about

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
I'm going to put them back in for about

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.130 
I'm going to put them back in for about
20<00:02:25.990> seconds<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.970> defrost<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.360> see<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:28.990> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
20 seconds on defrost and see if that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
20 seconds on defrost and see if that
does<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.380> trick

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.720 

okay<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.260> was<00:02:46.440> perfect<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.460> see

okay that was perfect now you can see
that<00:02:48.030> they're<00:02:48.270> all<00:02:49.700> melted<00:02:50.840> there's<00:02:51.840> no<00:02:52.140> more

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350

and<00:03:29.150> make<00:03:29.510> sure<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:29.990> all<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.190> air

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
and make sure you get all of the air

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.970 
and make sure you get all of the air
bubbles<00:03:31.400> out<00:03:32.770> before<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:33.920> start<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:35.980> just

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
bubbles out before you start and just

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.010 
bubbles out before you start and just
kind<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.340> squeeze<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:42.700> kind<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.820> push<00:03:44.690> all<00:03:44.900> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
kind of squeeze and kind of push all the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.130 
kind of squeeze and kind of push all the
air<00:03:45.140> bubbles<00:03:45.170> out<00:03:45.650> like<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:47.750> one<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:47.989> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
air bubbles out like this on one of the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.949 
air bubbles out like this on one of the
corners<00:03:49.330> you're<00:03:50.330> going<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.540> want<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.780> have

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
corners you're going to want to have

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.580 
corners you're going to want to have
your<00:03:50.989> little<00:03:51.580> balls<00:03:52.580> close<00:03:53.090> by<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:56.380> go<00:03:57.380> ahead

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
your little balls close by and go ahead

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.130 
your little balls close by and go ahead
and<00:03:57.800> start<00:03:58.160> with<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.640> center<00:03:59.150> you're<00:04:00.110> going

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
and start with the center you're going

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.350 
and start with the center you're going
to<00:04:00.350> make<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.830> thicker<00:04:01.190> than<00:04:01.610> what<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.940> actual

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
to make it thicker than what the actual

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.510 
to make it thicker than what the actual
picture<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:02.959> so<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:03.860> not<00:04:04.130> very

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
picture is so that it's not very

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:35.909 
picture is so that it's not very
delicate<00:04:05.830> when<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:09.190> pick<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.220> up

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.320 

make<00:04:36.520> sure<00:04:36.759> you<00:04:36.999> get<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.389> center<00:04:38.550> really<00:04:39.550> good

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.450 

and<00:04:43.330> we<00:04:43.449> know<00:04:43.659> that<00:04:43.870> no<00:04:44.259> two<00:04:44.319> snowflakes<00:04:44.650> are

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
and we know that no two snowflakes are

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.429 
and we know that no two snowflakes are
alike<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.330> it's<00:04:46.509> okay<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:47.080> all<00:04:47.229> your

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
alike so it's okay if all your

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.989 
alike so it's okay if all your
snowflakes<00:04:47.889> are<00:04:48.099> a<00:04:48.129> little<00:04:48.279> bit<00:04:48.520> different

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:48.999 
snowflakes are a little bit different

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:53.010 
snowflakes are a little bit different
and<00:04:50.550> then<00:04:51.550> you're<00:04:52.240> going<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.389> use<00:04:52.599> your<00:04:52.810> little

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
and then you're going to use your little

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.999 
and then you're going to use your little
balls<00:04:53.319> I<00:04:53.889> like<00:04:54.759> to<00:04:54.969> put<00:04:56.039> three<00:04:57.039> in<00:04:57.249> the<00:04:57.400> middle

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
balls I like to put three in the middle

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.309 
balls I like to put three in the middle
you<00:05:00.009> can<00:05:00.039> use<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.629> toothpick<00:05:01.629> to<00:05:01.840> move<00:05:02.139> them

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
you can use a toothpick to move them

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.760 
you can use a toothpick to move them
together<00:05:02.560> closer<00:05:03.159> if<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.669> want<00:05:03.939> as<00:05:04.180> well

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
together closer if you want as well

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:13.050 
together closer if you want as well
that's<00:05:05.770> easier<00:05:06.279> to<00:05:06.370> do<00:05:06.759> and<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:10.439> one<00:05:11.439> on<00:05:12.060> each

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
that's easier to do and then one on each

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.939 
that's easier to do and then one on each
end<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:15.129> snowflake<00:05:19.740> you're<00:05:20.740> going<00:05:20.889> to

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
end of the snowflake you're going to

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.260 
end of the snowflake you're going to
want<00:05:21.129> to<00:05:21.250> make<00:05:21.400> sure<00:05:21.639> that<00:05:21.819> you<00:05:21.969> put<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
want to make sure that you put the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.219 
want to make sure that you put the
little<00:05:22.419> balls<00:05:22.870> on<00:05:23.879> right<00:05:24.879> away<00:05:25.210> before<00:05:25.629> your

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
little balls on right away before your

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.490 
little balls on right away before your
chocolate<00:05:26.949> hardens<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.900> then<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.229> would<00:05:29.379> be

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
chocolate hardens and then it would be

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.820 
chocolate hardens and then it would be
impossible<00:05:29.770> for<00:05:30.159> them<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> stick<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.710> you're

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
impossible for them to stick so you're

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.950 
impossible for them to stick so you're
going<00:05:32.979> to<00:05:33.009> continue<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.759> do<00:05:33.969> this<00:05:34.889> on<00:05:35.889> each<00:05:36.849> one

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.050 

again<00:05:40.960> making<00:05:41.259> sure<00:05:41.439> you<00:05:41.830> make<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.069> even

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
again making sure you make it even

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.709 
again making sure you make it even
thicker<00:05:44.279> than<00:05:45.279> what<00:05:45.639> you<00:05:45.849> have<00:05:46.060> on<00:05:46.270> your<00:05:46.300> paper

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
thicker than what you have on your paper

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.230 
thicker than what you have on your paper
so<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.409> it<00:05:48.009> doesn't<00:05:48.370> break<00:05:48.520> when<00:05:48.849> you<00:05:48.969> try<00:05:49.210> to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
so that it doesn't break when you try to

00:05:49.240 --> 00:06:06.470 
so that it doesn't break when you try to
peel<00:05:49.539> it<00:05:49.599> off

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:17.470 

ah

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.080 

you<00:06:18.080> should<00:06:18.320> let<00:06:18.500> your<00:06:18.620> snowflakes<00:06:19.280> dry<00:06:19.730> for

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
you should let your snowflakes dry for

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.170 
you should let your snowflakes dry for
at<00:06:20.180> least<00:06:20.300> an<00:06:20.720> hour<00:06:20.930> but<00:06:21.710> you<00:06:21.890> can<00:06:22.130> also<00:06:22.370> make

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
at least an hour but you can also make

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.990 
at least an hour but you can also make
them<00:06:23.360> ahead<00:06:23.540> of<00:06:23.690> time<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:24.410> couple<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.310> days<00:06:25.520> even

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
them ahead of time a couple of days even

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.630 
them ahead of time a couple of days even
and<00:06:26.300> leave<00:06:27.080> them<00:06:27.290> out<00:06:27.530> on<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.130> wax<00:06:28.340> paper

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
and leave them out on the wax paper

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.490 
and leave them out on the wax paper
until<00:06:29.150> you're<00:06:29.300> ready<00:06:29.450> to<00:06:29.600> put<00:06:29.900> them<00:06:30.050> on<00:06:30.140> top<00:06:30.320> of

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
until you're ready to put them on top of

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.910 
until you're ready to put them on top of
your<00:06:30.620> cupcakes<00:06:31.600> when<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:32.750> peel<00:06:33.020> them<00:06:33.290> you

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
your cupcakes when you peel them you

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.830 
your cupcakes when you peel them you
want<00:06:34.100> to<00:06:34.160> be<00:06:34.280> really<00:06:34.730> careful<00:06:35.240> because<00:06:35.450> they

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
want to be really careful because they

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.310 
want to be really careful because they
are<00:06:35.990> very<00:06:36.320> fragile<00:06:36.910> so<00:06:37.910> you<00:06:37.970> want<00:06:38.300> to<00:06:38.390> lift<00:06:38.630> the

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
are very fragile so you want to lift the

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.350 
are very fragile so you want to lift the
wax<00:06:39.530> paper<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.250> very<00:06:41.060> very<00:06:41.600> gently<00:06:42.970> peel<00:06:43.970> one

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
wax paper and very very gently peel one

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.570 
wax paper and very very gently peel one
at<00:06:44.510> a<00:06:44.600> time<00:06:45.700> off<00:06:46.700> of<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:47.210> wax<00:06:47.420> paper<00:06:51.580> as

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
at a time off of the wax paper as

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.490 
at a time off of the wax paper as
delicately<00:06:53.480> as<00:06:53.570> you<00:06:53.930> can<00:06:59.050> now<00:07:00.050> you're<00:07:00.290> ready

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
delicately as you can now you're ready

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.250 
delicately as you can now you're ready
to<00:07:00.710> put<00:07:00.890> them<00:07:01.040> on<00:07:01.070> top<00:07:01.430> of<00:07:01.670> your<00:07:01.820> cupcakes<00:07:02.330> make

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
to put them on top of your cupcakes make

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.470 
to put them on top of your cupcakes make
sure<00:07:03.500> that<00:07:03.710> you<00:07:03.860> put<00:07:04.100> them<00:07:04.280> on<00:07:04.460> top<00:07:04.760> right

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
sure that you put them on top right

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.290 
sure that you put them on top right
after<00:07:05.900> you<00:07:06.080> frosted<00:07:06.710> them<00:07:06.920> so<00:07:07.880> that<00:07:08.120> the

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
after you frosted them so that the

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.330 
after you frosted them so that the
frosting<00:07:08.540> doesn't<00:07:08.960> harden<00:07:09.590> before<00:07:09.770> you<00:07:10.100> put

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
frosting doesn't harden before you put
