00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:08.080
 Hello . It's time for the synthesis. 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.849
 I have not been able to strengthen my soul seats these days . 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 I think you're pulling it. 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:20.699
 I'm afraid I might get a little duplicated in the first place, 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 Let's start with the 33rd synthesis. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 I prepared Kaage and Rebecca. 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:42.650
 Cat Cat 8 and Rebecca Cat 5 are ready. 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:49.420

 Nemesis and Jerry came out. 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.070
 Now, it's a character that's not a duplicate now, and it 's okay with Boss War. 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.509
 Many 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 I think it's okay. But then again, I am greedy and try the flowering again. 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.540
 I want to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.060
 Even if the parties fail again to return because they have a number of Miss lng 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:23.049
 I'll try. 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.049
 I wish I could have finished with it, but I will start drawing again. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.670
 Azabbian came out. 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:36.310

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.760

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 Vivian finally came out on the 33rd. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.450
 I'll pick Vivian. 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.140
 I finally picked Vivian. 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.140
 Now 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.560
 Come on, Vivian. 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.560
 I finally got the main character to move. 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:11.450
 Passive says that when you use Jack Pascal you get a critical hit and recovery. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:16.930
 I finally got the br on the side. 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.930
 As soon as I get it, I will try hardening it. 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.709
 This is the second party there is the party our hero immediately strengthen the fly 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.939

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.250
 I am going to the Jayu River. 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.349
 I feel like I'm feeling better and I'm getting stronger because I'm the main character too. 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.010
 About three. 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.890
 Now that I have only Serran , I will continue to defend it. 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.519
 Vivian is also pretty good as well, and finally, 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:08.560
 Designing fuel economy I can finish it with an egg 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:11.500
 I am sure Vivian is good as well. 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.049
 I had a feeling like that right now. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:22.120
