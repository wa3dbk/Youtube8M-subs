navigating<00:02:04.119> a<00:02:04.750> lot<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.020> people<00:02:05.260> don't<00:02:05.470> think

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
navigating a lot of people don't think

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.699 
navigating a lot of people don't think
about<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.580> do<00:02:06.760> need<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.000> bright

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
about is you really do need a bright

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.529 
about is you really do need a bright
robust<00:02:08.709> screen<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.459> able<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.729> navigate<00:02:10.000> and

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
robust screen to be able to navigate and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.860 
robust screen to be able to navigate and
speaking<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.319> navigation<00:02:11.950> view<00:02:12.220> map<00:02:12.870> that's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
speaking of navigation view map that's

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630 
speaking of navigation view map that's
kind<00:02:14.139> of<00:02:14.200> garmin's<00:02:14.590> bread<00:02:14.829> and<00:02:15.010> butter

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
kind of garmin's bread and butter

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.350 
kind of garmin's bread and butter
and<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.840> see<00:02:16.870> here<00:02:17.940> we're<00:02:18.940> tooling

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and as you can see here we're tooling

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.410 
and as you can see here we're tooling
around<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.810> our<00:02:19.930> Mercedes<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.610> Mercedes<00:02:22.240> is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
around in our Mercedes this Mercedes is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.790 
around in our Mercedes this Mercedes is
blue<00:02:22.630> on<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> screen<00:02:23.110> we're<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.410> black<00:02:23.620> one

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
blue on the screen we're in a black one

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
blue on the screen we're in a black one
and<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.100> think<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.540> again<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.930> got<00:02:26.080> those

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and I think but again it's got those

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.170 
and I think but again it's got those
maps<00:02:26.470> pre-loaded<00:02:27.069> in<00:02:27.160> their<00:02:27.400> rights<00:02:27.970> they

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
maps pre-loaded in their rights they

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
maps pre-loaded in their rights they
locked<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.660> pretty<00:02:29.080> well<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.680> in

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
locked on pretty well and that is in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.420 
locked on pretty well and that is in
fact<00:02:30.690> let's<00:02:31.690> see<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.530> street<00:02:32.830> sign<00:02:33.040> somewhere

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
fact let's see the street sign somewhere

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.010 
fact let's see the street sign somewhere
now<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:33.880> that's<00:02:34.060> where<00:02:34.209> we<00:02:34.330> are<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.840> see

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
now but that's where we are you can see

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.090 
now but that's where we are you can see
out<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> window<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:36.300> can<00:02:37.300> see<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
out the window you can see the the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.970 
out the window you can see the the
circle<00:02:39.100> right<00:02:39.250> here<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.700> vague<00:02:39.850> there<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.240> go

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
circle right here the vague there you go

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.949 
circle right here the vague there you go
that's<00:02:41.980> why<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.220> get<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.489> demo<00:02:42.730> from<00:02:43.090> from<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
that's why you get a demo from from the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.750 
that's why you get a demo from from the
navigation<00:02:44.110> guy<00:02:44.650> he<00:02:44.830> knows<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.190> points<00:02:45.730> of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
navigation guy he knows the points of

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.340 
navigation guy he knows the points of
interest<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.930> look<00:02:47.110> at<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.840> that's<00:02:49.840> really<00:02:50.110> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
interest to look at so that's really the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.860 
interest to look at so that's really the
core<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:51.580> what<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> nuvi<00:02:52.180> phone<00:02:52.390> does<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
core of what the nuvi phone does and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.210 
core of what the nuvi phone does and
frankly<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.380> makes<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.739> different<00:02:53.920> from

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
frankly what makes it different from

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.120 
frankly what makes it different from
anything<00:02:54.519> else<00:02:54.760> out<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:56.620> addition<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
anything else out there in addition to

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.070 
anything else out there in addition to
that<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.489> got<00:02:57.670> your<00:02:57.850> typical<00:02:58.120> contacts<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
that it's got your typical contacts the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.410 
that it's got your typical contacts the
neat<00:02:59.260> thing<00:02:59.470> about<00:02:59.500> from<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.040> contact<00:03:00.459> list<00:03:00.790> is

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
neat thing about from a contact list is

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.300 
neat thing about from a contact list is
if<00:03:01.660> any<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.900> these<00:03:02.050> contacts<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:03.010> an<00:03:03.130> address

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
if any of these contacts have an address

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.180 
if any of these contacts have an address

address associated with it you can

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.090 
address associated with it you can
navigate<00:03:12.940> straight<00:03:13.630> from<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.019> contact<00:03:14.650> to
