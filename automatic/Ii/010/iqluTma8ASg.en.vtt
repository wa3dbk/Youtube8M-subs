00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.110
 the relationship between tension headache and 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.840
 the emotional problems that can 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.980
 do tension-type headache is a kind of 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.170
 typically symmetrical headache affects 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.800
 the two sides of the head unlike 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.890
 the migraine that only affects one 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 and can affect the temples can opt 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 to the forehead also to the neck and there 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.019
 also a form that is the way what 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.090
 cranial that affects all the leather 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.070
 scalp is always very important that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 be to take it into account that is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.909
 symmetrical evolution may be chronic 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 that is, it can be maintained throughout 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.800
 of time this contribution to more than 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 3 percent of patients or 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 present what happens with much more 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.040
 often in the form of crisis that is 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.190
 appears and disappears spontaneously 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.350
 lasting keeps a few minutes 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 several hours or some patients several 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
 days affects 69 percent of the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.940
 men of all men throughout 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.880
 of his life and this percentage increases the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.460
 female population up to 88% is for 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.679
 therefore an extremely pathology 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 frequent of all those affected up 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.119
 37 percent presents several 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.649
 episodes in a month the studies reveal 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.149
 that usually appears in the second decade 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.490
 of life and tends to decrease 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.100
 over the years 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.829
 and unlike migraine lacks for 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 complete of a genetic substrate or of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.490
 aura that are the neurological symptoms 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.640
 that precede the symptoms then of this 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.979
 iii or two etc 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 Now there is never the national tensional 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.900
 it is a type of headache very influenced 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.150
 extremely influenced by factors 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.130
 mental disorders as opposed to migraine in 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.869
 which the presence of such factors 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.640
 can be even smaller than in the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.190
 population in general 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 the anxiety of mental exhaustion the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.450
 stress family dysfunctions 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.210
 the psychic tension maintained the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.729
 depression disorders dell 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.709
 strict obsessive insomnia the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.870
 hysteria and hypochondria schizophrenia 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.959
 they are also pathologies in which they have 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.300
 found more frequent of our 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.550
 studies of tensional stability in 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.709
 these psychiatric patients with 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.540
 tension headache also means a 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.900
 decreased serotonin activity as 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.069
 anxiety occurs in depression between 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 other psychiatric disorders 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.840
 in fact the tension area is usually 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.120
 the first symptom of many patients 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.310
 psychiatrists who debut a disease 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 mental 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.450
 the scalp has glasses 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.420
 thin blood vessels that run between 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.569
 the muscular layer 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.270
 covers the leather with the skull that did have 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.860
 He stopped the skin and the skull from also to 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.130
 Sometimes its course is perceptible only in 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.569
 more exposed areas such as the temples 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 in this figure we illustrate the state 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.959
 Normal of these vessels appear in red 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.790
 the arteries that are rich in oxygen and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.709
 in blue the veins that are rich in 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.190
 carbon dioxide the mechanism of the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.930
 tension headache originates when 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.920
 produces an involuntary contraction of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.220
 the muscular layer 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.069
 the spout from the occipital area to the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 frontal area is the occipital muscle 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.560
 front but you can also participate 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 the two temporal muscles that are 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.540
 placed on the temples as illustrated by 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.460
 figure this contraction compress the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.180
 blood bones against 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.180
 the skull 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.209
 reducing its caliber and thus reducing 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.090
 the contribution of oxygen to the area by the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.770
 bleeding of the arteries and form 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.360
 parallel the elimination of dioxide 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.959
 carbon due to the strangulation of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.060
 veins this generates an increase in co2 very 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.510
 important and generates triggers a 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.530
 cascade of dilating mechanisms 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.970
 abruptly the blood vessels that 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.640
 they struggle to expand among the leather 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.530
 scalp contracted against the clan in the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.989
 that what is ending is indeformable 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 producing a feeling that almost all 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.200
 We have had some moment of our 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.470
 life that is as if I was about to 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.130
 burst us the head the contraction of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.550
 these muscles 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.680
 it can be local or a consequence of a 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.450
 rising tension of the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.850
 muscles of the back of the neck of the 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.940
 neck and so on and that's why it's frequent 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.790
 that the headache is accompanied by certain 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.940
 contraction degree of contracture of 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 the nape of the shoulders and so on is in 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.800
 these cases in which they identify 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.860
 more emotional factors more 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.860
 mental illness or more stress a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.600
 important part of these patients 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.820
 suffer tension headaches and problems 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.260
 are never simultaneous psychological 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.409
 aware of suffering 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.479
 mental suffering 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.360
 are being victims of what is 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.129
 denominates a somatization by which the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.550
 patient expresses through a symptom 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.919
 physical a hidden psychic pain that 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.599
 it produces the patients on the other side 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.360
 tend to show a greater tendency to 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.399
 recurrence is a greater difficulty 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.830
 against the control of pain by 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.539
 usual measures of treatment that 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.969
 are the analgesics and 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.919
 anti-inflammatory these cases should be 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.989
 evaluated by a psychiatrist after 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.230
 that the neurologist has ruled out 

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:27.270
 neurological cause for 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.210
 Obviously investigate possible 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.190
 unresolved emotional conflicts that 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.200
 they may be expressing themselves because of the pain 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.440
 in mild cases where you do not 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.750
 consider psychotherapy indicated 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.090
 by introspection or a therapy 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.190
 cognitive-behavioral patients 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.750
 they can improve with techniques we say 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.120
 superficial relaxation 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.700
 biofeedback yoga 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.650
 or as 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.890
 we are going to incorporate both in group of 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.510
 another líberos that is the technique of the 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.270
 procedure of relaxing muscles 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.160
 parietals and frontal typical dresses 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.890
 by injecting toxin 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.420
 botulinum which prevents shrinkage 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.230
 and let's say the waterfall that ends 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.750
 ending in an explosion of the 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.100
 headache complex cases notwithstanding 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.890
 should always be addressed through 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.000
 psychotherapy and if necessary 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.280
 obviously with treatment 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.440
 simultaneous pharmacological 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.510
 Dr. Mosley who was a reputed 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.430
 reputed English psychiatrist said that 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.520
 when the eyes do not cry towards that 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.380
 other sobbing bodies have is in a few 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.580
 words the mechanism that governs the 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.680
 somatization 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.379
 the patient in these cases can not 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.870
 recognize not even express your 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.460
 emotional conflict in such a way that what 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.919
 repressed in an unconscious plane 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.860
 through a very important expenditure of 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.719
 energy in such a way that it ends 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.639
 transforming it into a physical symptom not 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:53.349
 can express it emotionally what 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.240
 translates and leaves on the other hand that nobody 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.860
 it is expected not for that reason the objective 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.710
 end of therapy is to allow the 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.240
 patient ends up being aware of his 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.819
 conflict and can elaborate it 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.849
 emotionally in this way stop 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:09.429
 need to express it through the 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:12.069
 headache and may use the energy that 

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.899
 before it was used in its repression 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.059
 the repression of unconscious conflict 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:19.059
 in much more rewarding tasks and 

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:20.830
 constructive with this we finish the 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.719
 chapter dedicated to the tension strain 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.589
