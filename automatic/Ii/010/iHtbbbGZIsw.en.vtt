00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.520
 Ah 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.119
 The third story 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:18.279
 It's a brother who has to be memorized. 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:23.529
 It's a bit too basic for the attitude of life . 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:27.250
 In a class it can significantly control the students who are studying divided into two 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.029
 There are students who have studied to make me look smart . 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.660
 In order to prove that you are smart, 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.640
 There is also a class. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 I know that I do not know how to improve my skills. 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.020
 Improving . Sometimes I want to improve my skills . 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.850
 There are two sub-categories according the difficulty came when the problem that is easy manitto 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.930
 Until junior high school arch that such issues should not put high manitto 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:00.430
 It 's important that those who are interested in university studies are just smart 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:05.710
 The bass is going to be very hot in advance of the test because I do not see anything. 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:10.780
 When I came up with a problem I had a chance to test it something like 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:15.069
 Eventually it deteriorates how did not receive a very smart evaluate the state of fear 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.360
 I use my own 3-band cabin , 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:21.340
 If you heard the one doing the guests a friend I tried to say the game 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.739
 Anhaeseo're not the test 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.720
 Because I thought that if I could make an effort, I would get good grades. 

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:35.649
 How we look at the fact that Trang very flimsy self-esteem will eventually protect 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.450
 It 's important to keep going smart even though it's ruining your life 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:43.750
 Because it does not change that attitude doet'm quite a bit musikjaengyi 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:50.130
 I got involved. Then I messed up the puppet . 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.130
 One of the features is the low level because of the problem that many come to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.850
 If you try to solve all the problems by yourself , 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.680
 That's' cause you're talking about, I've fall in harder forms such other 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.659
 People versus whether to work 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.440
 These people did request that these abilities are so great off air 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.340
 When we Slut groups gals that I Giro build something * 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.420
 I think that it is the executive power that I can push and achieve things. 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.350
 It's important, but one of the really important elements of executive power is whiteness 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.180
 When you have difficulty, give any advice whatsoever to any other wise path 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 The ability to ask for or ask for help is extremely important in practice 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 Its physiological outstanding people alone, without a lot of myself like that with 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:40.880
 The loose out here a well-developed person who can issue such a thing eventually 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:45.739
 So those who have great morbid powers so I really 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.430
 Those who can not keep up with the conference after the meeting 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.239
 This is a psychological upgrade. What are you talking about? 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.160
 just 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.940
 I consciously think that I should be sluggish, but unconsciously I 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.980
 I have a 20-year-old guy with his own negative . 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:08.209
 I basically have my flaws to me what the problem is and lift Yes 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:13.400
 Life is already over, the conscious more defeat that I was defeated 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:17.870
 Why unconscious thought dwaetdago wrong or defective while the Reaper essentially operate as a 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.160
 I have such a deep-rooted problem of low self-esteem have thought it 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.940
 So uh, I have my own 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:30.340
 When I'm working on self-esteem , I'm confident and a little different. 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.420
 It is called self-esteem b which is conditional in that which I myself 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.690
 Not done 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.070
 What are you talking about? 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.480
 Regardless of 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.450
 Bicho books ever to think my own mind and in my own worth 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.069
 From here it 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.700
 Some of the evaluations I have of myself, not the thoughts , the fundamental self-esteem 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:58.030
 Inde in any defective part, I dwaetgo essentially no powder in 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:02.260
 If you think there are defects, these people will recognize the fact that I am now 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.549
 It's hard to love, so I have certain conditions or standards. 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.620
 This condition must have a basis, but I have to pay it back then. 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:16.180
 I am, and I think that I can love you, but the problem is 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:21.760
 It 's only his blame for power to get there . 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.539
 Now I think I do not like it, I have problems, I'm bad and I'm terrible. 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.190
 so 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:31.449
 In the short term, I will whip me in any short term goal charity 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.190
 It's possible, but in a long-lived woman, 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.690
 Until it comes to the 1st, it grows by the love of the parent is good in the opposition 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.560
 You do not. 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.310
 That's the same with your growth. 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.970
 In the end , love for oneself, 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.720
 Your own 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:56.910
 If you have a healthy heart, salt, and this will continue to the end, I like that my self Reaper 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.910
 Get out of the pool of blame.
