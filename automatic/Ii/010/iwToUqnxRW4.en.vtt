00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
honest sense I'm at City I think it is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.990 
honest sense I'm at City I think it is
the<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> connection

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
the first time I see that connection

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.219 
the first time I see that connection
really<00:01:06.000> strong<00:01:06.299> connection<00:01:06.780> between<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
really strong connection between the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.910 
really strong connection between the
fans<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.280> players<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.830> was

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
fans and the players it was it was

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.570 
fans and the players it was it was
really<00:01:11.189> good<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> watch<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:13.100> when<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.369> was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
really good to watch and when say I was

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090 
really good to watch and when say I was
called<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> second<00:01:15.180> gold<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.750> was<00:01:16.020> 100%<00:01:16.560> sure

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
called the second gold I was 100% sure

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.999 
called the second gold I was 100% sure
that<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.759> come<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.990> even<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> draw

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that will come back and even have a draw

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
that will come back and even have a draw
and<00:01:20.670> obviously<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.360> create<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.720> last<00:01:22.020> two

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and obviously we create these last two

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
and obviously we create these last two
chances<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.880> deserves<00:01:24.240> at

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
chances that that I think we deserves at

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.170 
chances that that I think we deserves at
all<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.159> many<00:01:26.340> positive<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
all but is so many positive things to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
all but is so many positive things to
take<00:01:27.479> from<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> game<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
take from this game and I think that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
take from this game and I think that
this<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> games<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:30.000> help<00:01:30.210> us<00:01:30.450> toward

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this kind of games will help us toward

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740 
this kind of games will help us toward
the<00:01:31.079> windage<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.360> saying<00:01:33.630> about

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the windage and just you saying about

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.870 
the windage and just you saying about
the<00:01:33.990> positive<00:01:34.409> things

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
the positive things

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.010 
the positive things
is<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> world<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.810> could

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is there any way in the world you could

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.260 
is there any way in the world you could
have<00:01:37.140> imagined<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.520> come

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
have imagined that we would have come

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.240 
have imagined that we would have come
back<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:39.630> three<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.860> everyone<00:01:41.100> was

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
back from three down and everyone was

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
back from three down and everyone was
fair<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.329> gonna<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.630> quite<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
fair in the it was gonna be quite a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.219 
fair in the it was gonna be quite a
heavy<00:01:43.140> defeat<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.479> who<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.200> e

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
heavy defeat so who do you think will e

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530 
heavy defeat so who do you think will e
on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> pitch<00:01:46.770> leaders<00:01:47.369> why<00:01:48.149> did<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> come

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
on the pitch leaders why did it come

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
on the pitch leaders why did it come
from<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
from I think when you look at the the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
from I think when you look at the the
first<00:01:50.220> half<00:01:50.579> Trinian's<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
first half Trinian's going back to the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
first half Trinian's going back to the
dressing<00:01:53.159> room<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.490> 10<00:01:53.729> men<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.869> have

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
dressing room with 10 men you just have

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
dressing room with 10 men you just have
to<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> gamma<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.579> play

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
to think about the gamma when we play

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.749 
to think about the gamma when we play
United<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.360> United<00:01:57.810> how<00:01:57.990> United<00:01:58.649> give<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.369> our

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
United at United how United give up our

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.090 
United at United how United give up our
United<00:02:00.509> except<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.500> fact<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.950> was

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
United except the fact that we was

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.760 
United except the fact that we was
better<00:02:02.340> than<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.990> said<00:02:04.200> our<00:02:04.439> hope

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
better than them and you said our hope

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.609 
better than them and you said our hope
that<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.130> cannot<00:02:05.430> gonna<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.820> look<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.619> six

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that is cannot gonna be look like six

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
that is cannot gonna be look like six
million<00:02:07.950> five<00:02:08.399> new<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> think<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
million five new but I think all the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.260 
million five new but I think all the
players<00:02:09.750> show<00:02:10.080> everybody's<00:02:10.590> wrong<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.270> they

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
players show everybody's wrong and they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.390 
players show everybody's wrong and they
came<00:02:12.450> back<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> desire

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
came back with the desire

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.420 
came back with the desire
to<00:02:13.640> fight<00:02:13.849> until<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.239> end<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.220> players<00:02:16.220> like

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
to fight until the end and players like

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.929 
to fight until the end and players like
James<00:02:16.730> Mina

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.580 

Micah<00:02:20.689> Richards<00:02:20.870> was<00:02:23.049> there<00:02:24.049> was<00:02:24.170> leading

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
Micah Richards was there was leading

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.800 
Micah Richards was there was leading
there<00:02:24.829> was<00:02:24.980> a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
there was a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.660 
there was a
actinic<00:02:26.810> example<00:02:27.409> yeah<00:02:27.799> this<00:02:28.280> period<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
actinic example yeah this period that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.890 
actinic example yeah this period that
the<00:02:28.790> player<00:02:29.120> show<00:02:29.569> was<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> was<00:02:30.439> fantastic<00:02:31.010> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the player show was a was fantastic and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.179 
the player show was a was fantastic and
this<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.079> this<00:02:33.260> kind<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.620> period<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.159> think

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
this is this kind of period I think

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.539 
this is this kind of period I think
where<00:02:34.640> you've<00:02:34.819> seen<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.799> character<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
where you've seen the character of the

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.770 
where you've seen the character of the
team<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.000> character<00:02:38.359> of<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.540> players

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
team and the character of the players

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.649 
team and the character of the players
because<00:02:39.049> quality<00:02:39.950> wise<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.129> think<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.760> all<00:02:40.939> the

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
because quality wise I think we all the

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.229 
because quality wise I think we all the
players<00:02:41.959> got<00:02:42.140> quality<00:02:42.590> but<00:02:43.489> when<00:02:43.670> he<00:02:43.760> became

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
players got quality but when he became

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.830 
players got quality but when he became
where<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:46.010> put<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:47.359> showed<00:02:47.599> up

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
where you have to put you you showed up

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.220 
where you have to put you you showed up
and<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.650> have<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.980> fight<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.359> think<00:02:50.599> we

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and just have to fight and I think we

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.190 
and just have to fight and I think we
show<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:52.760> we've<00:02:52.970> got<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.599> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
show that that we've got that and I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.379 
show that that we've got that and I
think<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:55.099> definitely<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:56.030> Berto

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
think that that definitely for Berto

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.259 
think that that definitely for Berto
satisfaction<00:02:57.609> there's<00:02:58.609> not<00:02:58.670> many<00:02:58.790> teams<00:02:59.090> that

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
satisfaction there's not many teams that

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.229 
satisfaction there's not many teams that
can<00:02:59.540> take<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.560> much<00:03:00.799> out<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.069> actually<00:03:01.849> losing

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
can take so much out of actually losing

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.720 
can take so much out of actually losing
the<00:03:02.329> game<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.500> was<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:04.040> was<00:03:04.159> too<00:03:04.430> harsh

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the game but it was it was too harsh

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.670 
the game but it was it was too harsh
wasn't<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.209> two<00:03:05.359> separate<00:03:05.689> halves<00:03:05.900> yeah<00:03:06.500> he

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
wasn't it two separate halves yeah he

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.039 
wasn't it two separate halves yeah he
was<00:03:06.889> he<00:03:07.549> was<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.269> when<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.629> come<00:03:08.870> out

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049

was he was and I think when you come out
of<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.319> games<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.129> feel<00:03:10.670> really
