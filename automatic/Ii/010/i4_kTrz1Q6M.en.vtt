unlike<00:01:21.050> us<00:01:21.380> yeah<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:21.860> met<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.430> different<00:01:22.820> kind

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
unlike us yeah we met a different kind

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.670 
unlike us yeah we met a different kind
of<00:01:23.120> vampire<00:01:23.240> movie<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:23.990> time<00:01:24.050> around<00:01:24.380> with

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
of vampire movie this time around with

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.930 
of vampire movie this time around with
Twilight<00:01:25.070> they<00:01:25.340> live<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> blood<00:01:25.820> of

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
Twilight they live on the blood of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.610 
Twilight they live on the blood of
animals<00:01:26.060> instead<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.020> blood<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.260> humans

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
animals instead of the blood of humans

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.440 
animals instead of the blood of humans
so<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.070> guess<00:01:28.190> I'm<00:01:28.460> that's<00:01:29.120> kind<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.360> a

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
so I guess I'm that's kind of a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.120 
so I guess I'm that's kind of a
significant<00:01:29.900> difference<00:01:30.200> human<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.010> human

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
significant difference human to human

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.220 
significant difference human to human
connection<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:32.120> just<00:01:32.510> basically<00:01:32.930> impossible

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
connection is just basically impossible

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.990 
connection is just basically impossible

lot<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.810> red<00:02:35.959> meat<00:02:37.720> pretty<00:02:38.720> much<00:02:38.840> every<00:02:39.140> single

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
lot of red meat pretty much every single

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.080 
lot of red meat pretty much every single
human<00:02:39.530> attribute<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.220> time<00:02:40.459> two<00:02:40.640> thousand

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
human attribute it's time two thousand

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.990 
human attribute it's time two thousand
that<00:02:41.420> my<00:02:41.720> character<00:02:41.780> also<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.650> read<00:02:43.000> people's

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
that my character also can read people's

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.970 
that my character also can read people's
minds<00:02:44.209> as<00:02:44.600> well<00:02:44.660> Edward<00:02:45.350> can't<00:02:45.590> read<00:02:45.709> her<00:02:45.830> mind

and so she's sort of like the stronger
yeah<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.680> guess<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.220> agree<00:02:49.519> no<00:02:50.030> it's

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
yeah I guess I kind of agree no it's

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.390 
yeah I guess I kind of agree no it's
true<00:02:50.450> she's<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:50.840> she<00:02:51.530> wasn't<00:02:51.739> about<00:02:52.100> you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
yeah there's something that's the thing

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.759 
yeah there's something that's the thing
is<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:53.780> everybody<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.290> what's<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.590> special
