00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 to have reached 3 humanity for 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.210

 guillaume ruiz the representative of this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 brand did not eat fucking desserts 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:53.399
 to eat them the same sources 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:55.259
 shop it's a product it's true that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.860
 often when buying a machine 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.420
 we already have people who have 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.410
 use of free products by 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 example so for machines 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.289
 preinstalled what can we tell them 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 obviously often on his machine 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.060
 it's a trial offer in general there 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.470
 is not everything and then at some point 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.820
 actually bafin only on the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.560
 outcome that you will make you 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.090
 masters and downs and when one has it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 installed on his pc computer 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.569
 we are completely stupid but why 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.269
 so why 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:37.469
 because watching a few days makes 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:39.689
 that this brothel software he's strong in 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.969
 pull and but he typed it my software 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.680
 so I'm going to shit I invoke 1-2-3 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.040
 whimsical for them to show him his 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 magic ball 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.870

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.230
 absolute protection yom bitumen 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.230
