 the Sudan electro variant they live is 10 instead of them 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.670
 b firstly 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.460
 how did they manage to bring an electric to him then? 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 a partnership is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.970
 and above all which components will thereafter be the percent nine 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.840
 Owners are available 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.000
 So put the cart pulls goals are very modular UBS 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.370
 Road from the break to the off-road car from the Baki to the Monster Truck or carry 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 Is it possible 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.600
 and percent 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 The brash of the expensive dates and Zach are to be supported by sports 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.450
 is installed 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.320
 percent 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.180
 is the middle section new gives a new culture shock with not very much 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.000
 strong hard components 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.720
 it is one percent continuous shaft drive the motor sits percent 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.050
 all together close to the rear axle with the main association 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 the compliments punk's components are almost identical 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.260
 Percent it is very classically built that one on one side 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 before the end of the motorcycle 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.440
 with the Porsche puts it fan and long considered 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 and here is room for the battery and where we now wanted to broad 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.030
 this ErlkÃ¶nig have just completed a conventional Corp. 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.439
 is the new one 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.020
 the Kokoro of cash registers 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.070
 in that the vehicle percent 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.890
 a brother has the burners is Meinhold used this is all something 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 Stable are also in the electric version 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.970
 the burners 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.720
 Gear in there that is the percent planets indulged two gearboxes 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.890
 bone 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.220
 Percent the suspension 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.019
 That should be all

 Completely survive the painter, he said 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.080
 in the variant is about too fast or maybe a bit faster 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.469
 depending on the provider burners 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.760
 the Burning Brother being a girl 10 and 8 5 depending on her 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.919
 Model service of course optional on board May gives significantly more power 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.609
 on the plate from Hong Kong 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.299
 the metals on the axles are identical to the burner. "Of course you can 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.969
 use in the area with he speaks and shows scene powertrain is percent 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.299
 Of course, they are not compatible, but there we have them 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.169
 created in the very very stable base 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.409
 where you have to look what you possibly still blacksmith 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.859
 brings 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.959
 I can do it okay now 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.239
 we make a one percent vehicle view on a basis we 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:58.969
 know 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.290
 Percent of the burner with much like that and bring that also for the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.949
 Electrical engineering he was our style before questions of technology on proven technology 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.509
 fall back and is also here at the speed 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.609
 a big help if the front axle with sites cars very Cottbus too 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.139
 check 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.159
 he has super traction 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.949
 Fun factor one hundred 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.430
 I could well imagine 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.799
 that the new medium is that you just ended and 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.359
 I'm already in the lead as release has offered 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.359
 So I'm looking forward to the model and if curious 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.329
 how Emmetten will eventually prove that in practice and percent 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.989
 yes also thanks for the interview and be on it 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.379
