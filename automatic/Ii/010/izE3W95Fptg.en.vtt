compact<00:01:21.030> plant<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
compact plant here I don't know the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
compact plant here I don't know the
scientific<00:01:23.159> name<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.909> man<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.630> been

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
scientific name for it but man it's been

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.800 
scientific name for it but man it's been
going<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> lot<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.310> seen<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:27.509> past

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
going a lot if you have seen a my past

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
going a lot if you have seen a my past
videos<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> height<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.430> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
videos you can see the height of it I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
videos you can see the height of it I
think<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.360> first<00:01:30.630> video<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> was

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
think on my first video I think it was

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.550 
think on my first video I think it was
like<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like around up to here and now it's it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.630 
like around up to here and now it's it's
humongous<00:01:35.340> compared<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:38.159> trial<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
humongous compared to that so trial is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
humongous compared to that so trial is
playing<00:01:38.909> help<00:01:39.119> try<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
playing help try to look up the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
playing help try to look up the
scientific<00:01:40.979> name<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> I'll<00:01:41.400> put<00:01:41.549> under<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
scientific name and I'll put under the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630 
scientific name and I'll put under the
description<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.810> beautiful<00:01:43.640> you
