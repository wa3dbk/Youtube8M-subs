your<00:01:45.810> improvements<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> connect<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> each

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
your improvements to connect to each

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.469 
your improvements to connect to each
other<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
other and it's not that you need to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.719 
other and it's not that you need to
improve<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> entire<00:01:49.220> acreage<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.460> woods

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
improve the entire acreage of your woods

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.420 
improve the entire acreage of your woods
your<00:01:50.970> habitat<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> do

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
your habitat it's just that what you do

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950 
your habitat it's just that what you do
improve<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.119> where<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> deer<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
improve and where you want the deer to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
improve and where you want the deer to
live<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> move<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> feed<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
live and move and feed you want to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
live and move and feed you want to
relate<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> each<00:01:57.780> other<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> be

relate to each other and you want to be
continuous

and this is an example right here behind
me<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.550> have<00:02:02.729> some<00:02:03.540> incredible<00:02:03.890> bedding<00:02:04.890> area

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
me we have some incredible bedding area

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.419 
me we have some incredible bedding area
to<00:02:05.970> begin<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:07.080> it's

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
to begin with just because it's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
to begin with just because it's
untouched<00:02:08.429> by<00:02:08.700> human<00:02:09.060> its<00:02:09.929> staggered<00:02:10.530> there's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
untouched by human its staggered there's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
untouched by human its staggered there's
a<00:02:10.950> lot<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.190> benches<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.730> there<00:02:11.940> there's<00:02:12.600> some

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
a lot of benches in there there's some

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.100 
a lot of benches in there there's some
thick<00:02:12.990> cover<00:02:13.230> here<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.810> it's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
thick cover here and there but it's it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930 
thick cover here and there but it's it's
fairly<00:02:16.350> random<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.010> large<00:02:17.190> area<00:02:17.430> I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
fairly random it's a large area I'm

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.790 
fairly random it's a large area I'm
probably<00:02:18.180> talking<00:02:18.390> 15<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.050> 20<00:02:19.350> acres<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.740> it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
probably talking 15 to 20 acres and it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.199 
probably talking 15 to 20 acres and it
goes<00:02:19.920> down<00:02:20.070> into<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.370> large<00:02:20.610> Hollow

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
goes down into a large Hollow

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.880 
goes down into a large Hollow
I<00:02:21.240> think<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.410> better<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.800> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I think we can do better than that I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
I think we can do better than that I
think<00:02:23.040> even<00:02:23.370> define<00:02:23.700> exactly<00:02:23.940> where<00:02:24.810> those

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
think even define exactly where those

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800 
think even define exactly where those
deer<00:02:25.200> will<00:02:25.350> bed<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.780> come

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
deer will bed and that way when we come

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.890 
deer will bed and that way when we come
in<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> stand<00:02:28.590> location<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.900> that's

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
in to a stand location like this that's

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
in to a stand location like this that's
about<00:02:31.140> 15<00:02:31.770> yards<00:02:31.950> behind<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> camera<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:32.970> we

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
about 15 yards behind the camera then we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.790 
about 15 yards behind the camera then we
know<00:02:33.270> where<00:02:33.480> those<00:02:33.600> deer<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:33.959> at<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.590> can

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
know where those deer are at so we can

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.040 
know where those deer are at so we can
pinpoint<00:02:35.030> where<00:02:36.030> they're<00:02:36.209> at<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.900> make

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
pinpoint where they're at we can make

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.090 
pinpoint where they're at we can make
sure<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.440> come<00:02:37.620> into<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> stand

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
sure when we come into the stand

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.740 
sure when we come into the stand
location<00:02:38.580> we're<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.820> spooking<00:02:39.300> those<00:02:39.450> deer

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
location we're not spooking those deer

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.910 
location we're not spooking those deer
and<00:02:40.070> then<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.730> course<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.120> leave<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:43.230> want

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and then of course when we leave we want

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.840 
and then of course when we leave we want
to<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.070> where<00:02:44.220> they're<00:02:44.370> feeding<00:02:44.550> where

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
to know where they're feeding where

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.610 
to know where they're feeding where
they're<00:02:45.000> moving<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.959> helped<00:02:46.200> us<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.470> in

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
they're moving and that helped us get in

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.870 
they're moving and that helped us get in
and<00:02:46.769> out<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> stand<00:02:47.190> location<00:02:47.640> without

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
and out of the stand location without

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.210 
and out of the stand location without
spooking<00:02:48.150> deer<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:49.170> at<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> same<00:02:49.500> time<00:02:49.769> you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
spooking deer but at the same time you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.410 
spooking deer but at the same time you
can<00:02:50.340> kind<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.580> imagine<00:02:50.670> there's<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> bedding

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
can kind of imagine there's the bedding

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.640 
can kind of imagine there's the bedding
area<00:02:51.600> behind<00:02:51.720> me<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.110> we're<00:02:52.200> gonna<00:02:52.260> improve

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
area behind me and we're gonna improve

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
area behind me and we're gonna improve
that<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> know<00:02:54.269> where<00:02:54.450> those<00:02:54.570> deer<00:02:54.840> are

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that I want to know where those deer are

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.229 
that I want to know where those deer are
traveling<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:56.280> come<00:02:56.430> into<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> waterhole

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
traveling but come into this waterhole

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.670 
traveling but come into this waterhole
will<00:02:57.420> create<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.660> travel<00:02:58.019> corridor<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.440> here

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
will create a travel corridor to here

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.740 
will create a travel corridor to here
and<00:02:59.370> then<00:02:59.550> from<00:02:59.670> here<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.970> want<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.330> exit

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and then from here I want them to exit

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.479 
and then from here I want them to exit
to<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.900> small<00:03:01.230> food<00:03:01.470> cloth<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.010> very<00:03:02.250> hidden

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to a small food cloth it's very hidden

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.550 
to a small food cloth it's very hidden
over<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.910> way<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.110> from<00:03:04.320> there

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
over this way and then from there

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.319 
over this way and then from there
they're<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:05.070> way<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:05.730> large<00:03:05.940> food

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
they're on the way to very large food

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.240 
they're on the way to very large food
plots<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.900> food<00:03:07.170> sources<00:03:07.650> out<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.980> middle

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
plots and food sources out in the middle

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.330

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.710 
of Awesome fields 67 acre field and so
once<00:03:11.610> they<00:03:11.790> get<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.060> those<00:03:12.209> areas<00:03:12.570> are

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
once they get to those areas are

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.289 
once they get to those areas are
completely<00:03:13.230> safe<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.310> small<00:03:14.579> food<00:03:14.790> plot<00:03:15.060> over
