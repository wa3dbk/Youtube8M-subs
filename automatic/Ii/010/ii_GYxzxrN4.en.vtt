00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.510
 you want and welcome to the 1 4 video 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:14.729
 there and many do not have the attitude to change from the answer and into the 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.039
 Dr 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.449
 Hornby again 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.429
 a second video 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.719
 made or I do 1 now 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.580
 and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.449
 Year from Wimmer 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.609
 so I have 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 following links 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 and around 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450
 You really do not have to do much 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.730
 you just have to install it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.330
 here these links 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.710
 for both Windows 7 build versions 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.790
 Just have a look for PC Sion you have and then you invite yourself 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.790
 for the mission I for example from now Windows 7 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.819
 64 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.819
 Red by vintage this was the area 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.670
 give it one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 and then this page comes here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 because like the Optimus 2 bar stand out 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 Yes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
 quite simply so that keeps the settings 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 around 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.640
 around the years and word or too 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.150
 if we do the same 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.549
 to z 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.020
 One can not say more year, you do not have to install anything that is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.900
 Wedel laying churches weighs 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.260
 and year 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.550
 in order to have done this in place of the PC just once again that of course makes 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.660
 There are not enough already installed 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.070
 and it should 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.790
 that should not work percent 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.040
 Dante installs her follow mushroom 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.730
 Unfortunately, I only found the Windows 7 64-bit edition 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.460
 but you have to look yourself 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.549
 what do we find Sion has and then 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.880
 Do you load the mission so here Windows 7 64bit gives it up for Windows 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.109
 Vista 64-bit 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.729
 thanks to optimal 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.539
 what that is the sound supports 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.900
 and now Schiphorst 400m market 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 or Petit Fours 900 m 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:30.749
 that is quite different so you would have to percent on the laptop or 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.929
 PC groups that the participants created as closely as that 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.629
 and there is the number 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.140
 and what do you think performance like Dior has to the criticism 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.899
 what should not stand that 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.509
 that should not be the case the deep Â» 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.779
 then you have unfortunately bad luck 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.359
 No of course not the please on the following link the post itself 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.259
 normal 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.859
 yes that is true and 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.599
 An always goes on when like the yes automatically detect 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.169
 Percent year just does it like me 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.219
 so i believe both 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 he does not think so, why do not I know why? 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.329
 yes, but that would actually work years for the return 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.459
 everything then you have to change the world 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.609
 but actually what he needs to know 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.969
 Dr 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969
 the light will not be easier for the administration to agree 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.110
 around 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.419
 yes, but that was it 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.439
 You can not say much about that, so what about the links? 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.239
 that is so 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.269
 again very short repetitions 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.649
 Summary 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.649
 the animal the Optimus can use that to rearrange 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.009
 and the food continues like the ADK 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:57.129
 So I have now installed but I think Mittmann is all normal 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.599
 that too a 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.550
 Yes 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.219
 So the most important 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.319
 first install the mouse 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.699
 It should work here 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.949
 yes so the wars then for the video 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.949
 Nothing else to say 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.569
 should spend Bremen 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.719
 then tell me please 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.810
 and there mateus
