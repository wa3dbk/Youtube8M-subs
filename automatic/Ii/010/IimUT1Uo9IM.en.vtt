00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.319
 welcome one more day to my channel I am 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.109
 laude and today I bring you a new gameplay 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.690
 of black ops 2 of zombies and we're in 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.700
 the map of town in cooperative and today 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.129
 I bring you a survival guide in 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.740
 this map in the farm to play 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.000
 three people or four to play 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
 with your friends and be able to endure 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.620
 quite rounds although I tell you that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.120
 It takes a long time if you want 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.970
 get a high round given that they come 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.770
 a lot of zombies like four or 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.030
 five times more than the individual is 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.430
 makes it very expensive to get to the round 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.890
 jump for example this game is a 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.870
 round 30 in which the part with your 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 friends of mine or be total 3 and we got to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.310
 round 30 and we were like 3 hours 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.519
 The truth is that if you want to climb routes, 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.469
 I recommend nothing to play in 3 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.899
 much better individual something that you have 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.629
 all day all afternoon because if not 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.190
 it's going to be eternal but good 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.409
 we are with the farm guide first 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 talk about the gameplay better yesterday and that 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.620
 did not have many reproductions many 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.000
 likes and I see that we like them a lot 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.369
 multi than what normal because in 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.590
 games are pretty bad if I will bring you 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.320
 once in a while if what really 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.210
 you like them but good if I will not be bringing 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.759
 zombies which is what I like the most 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.230
 and I cut it more you like the first thing 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.450
 all see 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.700
 you will be hearing that I have changed micro 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.110
 the truth this one sounds great already 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.450
 you'll say in the comments given that the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.640
 another mobile phone was still a little bad or 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 pretty bad so good that I'm going 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 through the hills of Ubeda we are going to talk 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.980
 of gameplay on farm like it's been done 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.300
 in survival in cooperative and good 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.790
 the strategy is that one is giving 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.440
 turns talking about two tractor truck or 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.180
 whatever you want to call and carry the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.760
 root weapon primarily to kill 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.490
 your two friends meet 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.200
 behind where the fence where on the map 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.940
 of trance you enter the map to be 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.910
 there camping and they only have two 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.860
 shelters a window and he answers the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.480
 of the ground the two can be 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 Covering both of you and what will come 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.190
 four to five while according to the other and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.660
 what do I say I was characters 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.820
 PRI members for this one 'do not go back this with 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.800
 most zombies really the ones 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660
 other two or three that are there means 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.400
 normally they will support that also 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.220
 must carry the weapon and line will help 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.200
 the other when asked to dance 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.510
 throwing a bit of lightning to take it 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.460
 just a little bigger it them 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.040
 of the 45 that comes to them the truth is 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.540
 another strategy is pretty good for 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.730
 go on the sport 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.739
 I was trying with friends to move 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.109
 all over the map and here to be with a 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.090
 zone expected to end up dying since 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:32.090
 I answer them very sauteed and to go and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.069
 they end up dying very easily and drinks 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.730
 indispensable as always given the tone 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.190
 more double shot and re bike titan 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
 speed queue really the 4 of vigo that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.310
 allow you 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.440
 who at the possibility of having the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.780
 drinks but good are the meals 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.520
 normal I really do not get anything 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.760
 more is what I always use double 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.290
 equal mental shot on this map not 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.600
 you need to have money since there is no 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.090
 much to buy while in the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.530
 cash and armani simply find the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.050
 meetings is the rayon 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.430
 military money for nothing because here not 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.020
 it's like the other game that they delimited 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.700
 chinero to open doors and all that 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.590
 there must be no door is all 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.300
 already open and good that case the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.240
 galvanized but you're not in the round 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.350
 33 nothing to do with acosta the truth 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.850
 I think this guide is going to come 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.260
 pretty good the people who play 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.360
 cooperative with a friend and wants to be 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.980
 Laughter is a good afternoon and get to 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.959
 alternate rounds that this is the best 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.640
 I will bring you guides on other maps 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.340
 estimates by are also enough as 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.780
 town or station in station the truth 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.340
 that had something with some of our 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.830
 subscribers to try to make a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.170
 round 20 or 25 because the truth is enough 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.670
 since it's pretty good such an Indian some 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.220
 day of this you know know to throw a 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.200
 challenge with you equal 4 on some map 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.180
 rare in any of the four maps 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.980
 the four users of the room 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.110
 until the round we get the truth 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.930
 that could be pretty good challenged us 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.490
 inside us to make the channel a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.760
 little more entertaining do a few videos 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.760
 bad 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.769
 that is to say that I'm going to start boarding 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.890
 the router round 45 on the map of the town 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.469
 going up the 10 rounds every day so that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.569
 see what we have to do in each 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.000
 round how to survive what weapons to carry 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.040
 what advantages do they have to do in general 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.350
 I have all commented on myself in the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.419
 videos of about 5 6 or 7 minutes such and 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.759
 as you want I see that the videos of 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.880
 phoenix you love in the video was dsr 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.750
 it's amazing that nowadays 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.750
 extreme of the channel 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.860
 a lot of illusion given that it implies 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.170
 easy me so the zombies comes 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.600
 pretty good also test on this map 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.990
 say that it is simply what would not be 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.960
 here fans 3 noticed very important for 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.630
 carry out if you just kill the one weapon of 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.000
 rays use accounts because it is that 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.330
 no kill the only thing that kills is that of 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.620
 radios you can already use one of that ere 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.599
 a light machine gun is not going to 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.610
 kill will only kill of king when in the 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.069
 round 30 the waves are amazing and 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.830
 If you have any doubt, comment 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:08.400
 breath so that it will be up on Monday 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.890
 January 21 I think it's Gonzalez but 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.900
 night fights helps a lot to the road 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.550
 It helps me a lot to keep climbing a 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.470
 daily video for a super sic what 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.170
