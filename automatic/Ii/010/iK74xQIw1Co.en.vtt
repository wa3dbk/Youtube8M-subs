00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.370
 we start our this year 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.559
 advent calendar with this romantic 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.540
 daily baroque star 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.509
 you'll just see it easily and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:23.880
 consists only of four rounds the small one 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:26.880
 I have star with a microfiber yarn 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 crocheted for the video I'll take again 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 an omega plus and crochet hook number 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.810
 four 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.520
 So you better see what I do 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:01:05.219
 start with a thready ring with eleven 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:01:07.710
 fixed mesh 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 den 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:11.640
 threading ring do not contract yet 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 very firm and the round with a chain 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.639
 Close machine first mesh 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.069
 So we need twelve stitches the cat 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.859
 Therefore, mesh counts only 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.499
 Eleven fixed meshes started and the 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.170
 closing cat mesh counts as twelfth 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:31.079
 mesh second round three walls 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.509
 air masses and a whole city in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.659
 the very first mesh and in every one 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:47.990
 following mesh each two whole 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:47.990
 rod 456 and so on and so forth 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.789
 we have then with the turn 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.139
 air masses 24 sticks in the round 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.319
 and also this round will be back 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.329
 a chain in the third turn 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.770
 air mass are the highest terrain 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.770
 Air mass closed 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.570
 in round three against lots of small bows 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.390
 five air masses then a mesh 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.540
 skip and a solid stitch i 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.430
 count only as a precaution to choose 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.480
 I am indeed very happy to count 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.210
 as we know, if we really 12 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.610
 Bows at the end have been true 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.760
 So 5 air masses a mesh 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.220
 always skip a tight loop 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.820
 always so through the whole round five 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.820
 air masses mount a mesh one 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.550
 fixed machine the next mesh and so on 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:56.070
 continue and immediately you should stop 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:59.240
 have twelve such bows and these too 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.240
 round is closed 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.600
 So after the last five air masses 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.000
 with a chain mesh in the first 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.860
 I count again if I am 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.190
 really then have twelve bows 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.190
 jawoll 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.719
 kat mesh in the beginning mesh should 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.269
 Now we have twelve little bows and 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.849
 already the fourth round starts we 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:37.079
 look with kat mesh in the middle 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:40.409
 of the first bow so a chain still 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:46.459
 a chain and worse exactly in the 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 in the middle one night to the top 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:59.329
 I would still like to have one and now 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.329
 7 air meshes 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.770
 and in the middle of the next bow 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.410
 where we sting a five books 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.690
 mesh i only have a fair bushes 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.350
 mesh veldes is quite as thick as you can 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.230
 with thinner no fish a regulated 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.660
 envelope in the middle stitch of the 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:29.410
 bows puncture thread still bring 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.800
 Fetch thread once that was that 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.860
 second times, thread this thread 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.190
 third times an envelope thread get that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.830
 fourth time I leave it at 4 now 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 Working phases through all loops 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.420
 pulling the needle 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:53.080
 you can make puffy stitches five times 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:05:00.880
 with inner can so now for 1 55 air 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:05.230
 mesh 1 2 3 4 5 and a cat mesh in 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:13.120
 the base in the first air mass and 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:16.630
 again seven fragrance meshes 45 67 and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.850
 a firm mesh in the middle of the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.870
 next bow you can do a cat 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.700
 make a mesh 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.520
 I actually have cat later 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.940
 made because they are still 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.230
 less than 7 air meshes and back in the 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.760
 next in the middle of the next one 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.000
 Bows a 5 or 4-tufted mesh 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:43.750
 in an envelope thread high four times 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.190
 or five times and then the working thread 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.530
 through all the loops on the needle 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:55.510
 pull in five air masses for a pico in 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.830
 the base a cat mesh and again 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.830
 seven air meshes 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:05.769
 and a cat machine the middle of the 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.159
 next bow I make yours 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:11.589
 myself makes love my kids mesh 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:17.649
 I should show you another seven 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:20.110
 air masses a four or five 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:22.889
 tuft mesh in the middle of the next 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.659
 bus and here I always stab 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.319
 You do not necessarily do that 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.929
 crochet 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.339
 but in this case looks prettier 

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:33.639
 if you look in the middle stitch 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:36.429
 punctuated by all 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.179
 loop on the needle five air masses 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:43.659
 make for the pico in the first air 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:47.610
 always two threads on a cat 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:50.679
 mesh and how to lift air mesh 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.769
 and you repeat that until the end of the 

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:52.769
 round 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.390
 So I like the cat mesh better 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.240
 so and at the end after the last seven 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.630
 air masses after typical mesh after 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.360
 pico a cat mesh was there pure 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.470
 started the ticket disgust needle 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:28.000
 resists a bit there 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:28.000
 to stab you then you are not willing 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.970
 has him so the thread through the 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:39.020
 pull last stitch off and cut 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.880
 neatly sew this star, too 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.060
 naturally moisturized and one 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.720
 Tense 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:52.120
 and of course the star is thinner 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:55.400
 crochet can be a lot more filigree and 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.260
 tender but I find it in both 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.470
 tracks looks pretty much joy 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.470
 in order to
