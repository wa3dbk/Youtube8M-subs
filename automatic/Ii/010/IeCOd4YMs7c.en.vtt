to bring back as many fish alive as I
did<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.579> believe<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> breeder<00:00:42.870> bags<00:00:43.200> have

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
did I believe that breeder bags have
revolutionized<00:00:44.840> collecting<00:00:45.840> fish<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
revolutionized collecting fish in the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
revolutionized collecting fish in the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wild and getting them back to the hobby

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.569

from<00:00:48.030> traveling<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> queres<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
from traveling to queres but I think of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.260 
from traveling to queres but I think of
their<00:00:50.700> cost<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.780> expensive<00:00:53.270> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
their cost because they are expensive is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.170 
their cost because they are expensive is
too<00:00:55.110> high<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.620> worrying<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.250> using<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
too high for worrying about using a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.080 
too high for worrying about using a
breeder<00:00:57.629> bag<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> ship<00:00:58.260> something<00:00:58.500> overnight

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
breeder bag to ship something overnight

but<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.510> useful<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.500> when

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
but they're really useful for is when

close<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.760> off<00:04:09.910> around<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.690> water<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.630> it's<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
close it off around the water so it's a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.259 
close it off around the water so it's a
wet<00:04:14.140> mess<00:04:14.519> another<00:04:15.519> reason<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> don't<00:04:16.090> like

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
wet mess another reason I don't like

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.759 
wet mess another reason I don't like
messing<00:04:16.690> with<00:04:16.810> breather<00:04:17.109> bags<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.560> that's

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
messing with breather bags is that's

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.699 
messing with breather bags is that's
messy<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:20.140> now<00:04:20.320> I'm<00:04:20.380> going<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.590> use

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
messy and now I'm going to use

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.710 
messy and now I'm going to use
rubberband<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.580> I'm<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.270> tie<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.539> off

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
rubberband and I'm going to tie it off

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.920 
rubberband and I'm going to tie it off
just<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.800> normally<00:04:24.039> would<00:04:24.630> nice<00:04:25.630> and

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
just like I normally would nice and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.980 
just like I normally would nice and
tight

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.600 

there<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.200> go<00:04:32.380> I'm<00:04:32.980> gonna<00:04:33.070> dry<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.370> off<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
there we go I'm gonna dry it off a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.290 
there we go I'm gonna dry it off a
little<00:04:33.820> bit<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.700> nice<00:04:36.970> cell

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
little bit there we have this nice cell

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.720 
little bit there we have this nice cell
and<00:04:37.600> what's<00:04:38.320> happening<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:39.040> oxygen<00:04:39.610> is

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
and what's happening is oxygen is

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.490 
and what's happening is oxygen is
getting<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.210> carbon<00:04:40.630> dioxide<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:41.080> getting<00:04:41.350> out

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
getting in carbon dioxide is getting out

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.620 
getting in carbon dioxide is getting out
and<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.430> can<00:04:42.580> have<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.790> little<00:04:43.030> fish<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.450> there

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
and you can have a little fish in there

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.340 
and you can have a little fish in there
now<00:04:44.610> when<00:04:45.610> you're<00:04:45.730> shipping<00:04:46.000> fry<00:04:46.360> very<00:04:47.110> very

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
now when you're shipping fry very very

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.690 
now when you're shipping fry very very
small<00:04:47.650> fish<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.130> aren't<00:04:48.280> going<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.430> fight

inside<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.060> bag<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.720> probably<00:04:50.710> put<00:04:51.360> ten

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
inside the bag you probably put ten

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.900 
inside the bag you probably put ten
half-inch<00:04:53.440> fry<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.890> set<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.160> back<00:04:54.250> like<00:04:54.490> this

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
half-inch fry and set it back like this

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.140 
half-inch fry and set it back like this
not<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.240> problem<00:04:56.100> one<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.280> dangers<00:04:57.850> a

breather<00:04:58.840> bags<00:04:59.110> however<00:04:59.530> is<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.430> fish

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
breather bags however is that the fish

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.720 
breather bags however is that the fish
have<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.210> be<00:05:01.330> completely<00:05:01.810> purged<00:05:02.230> of<00:05:02.470> food<00:05:02.770> if

have to be completely purged of food if

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.180 
have to be completely purged of food if

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.880 
fish start pooping inside the bag

into a breather bag if they're going to

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
be in the bag for more than say 24 hours

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
48 to 72 hours so if you're going to

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.870 
48 to 72 hours so if you're going to
 with<00:05:35.110> breather<00:05:35.320> bags<00:05:35.560> plan<00:05:36.250> ahead<00:05:36.610> and

 with breather bags plan ahead and

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.700 
 with breather bags plan ahead and
make<00:05:37.090> sure<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.300> fish<00:05:37.600> are<00:05:37.870> purged<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
make sure the fish are purged the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.060 
make sure the fish are purged the
problem<00:05:41.710> is<00:05:41.920> that<00:05:42.760> this<00:05:43.540> is<00:05:43.600> a<00:05:43.840> lot<00:05:44.230> of<00:05:44.470> water

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
problem is that this is a lot of water

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.730 
problem is that this is a lot of water
for<00:05:45.700> very<00:05:45.910> little<00:05:46.120> surface<00:05:46.480> area<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.230> the

for very little surface area and the

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.190 
for very little surface area and the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
distance between the space and the water

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.170 
distance between the space and the water
in<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.530> middle<00:05:50.590> of<00:05:50.920> that<00:05:51.040> to<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.760> membrane

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.480 
in the middle of that to the membrane
outside<00:05:52.570> is<00:05:52.750> quite<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> long<00:05:53.230> way<00:05:53.530> so<00:05:54.100> it's<00:05:54.250> not

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
outside is quite a long way so it's not

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.540 
outside is quite a long way so it's not
really<00:05:54.940> efficient<00:05:55.480> gas<00:05:55.690> transfer<00:05:56.400> so<00:05:57.400> what

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
really efficient gas transfer so what

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.690 
really efficient gas transfer so what
the<00:05:57.670> heat<00:05:57.910> sealer<00:05:58.360> allows<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.900> do<00:05:59.610> did<00:06:00.610> you

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
the heat sealer allows you to do did you

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.730 
the heat sealer allows you to do did you
put<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> fish<00:06:01.270> inside<00:06:01.720> here<00:06:02.170> let's<00:06:02.320> put<00:06:02.470> a<00:06:02.500> fish

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
put a fish inside here let's put a fish

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.720 
put a fish inside here let's put a fish
in<00:06:07.500> these<00:06:08.500> Gras<00:06:08.800> bees<00:06:09.040> are<00:06:09.190> going<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.370> work<00:06:09.520> out

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
in these Gras bees are going to work out

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.680 
in these Gras bees are going to work out
today<00:06:11.370> now<00:06:12.370> I<00:06:12.760> can<00:06:13.120> take<00:06:13.270> my<00:06:13.450> heat<00:06:13.690> sealer<00:06:15.690> and

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
today now I can take my heat sealer and

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.850 
today now I can take my heat sealer and
I<00:06:16.840> can<00:06:17.050> run<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.290> all<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.530> way<00:06:18.070> up<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:20.290> bag<00:06:20.500> all
