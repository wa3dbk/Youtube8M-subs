00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.720 
motion is bringing your arms up to the
sides<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:23.680> after<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.830> you'll<00:02:25.520> do

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
sides like so after that you'll do

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.940 
sides like so after that you'll do
shoulder<00:02:26.180> shoulder<00:02:27.110> rotation<00:02:27.910> back<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.950> then

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
shoulder shoulder rotation back and then

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.510 
shoulder shoulder rotation back and then
forward<00:02:32.320> next<00:02:33.320> you'll<00:02:33.980> squeeze<00:02:34.310> your

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
forward next you'll squeeze your

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.240 
forward next you'll squeeze your
shoulder<00:02:34.790> blades<00:02:34.820> together<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:39.250> next

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
shoulder blades together like so next

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.050 
shoulder blades together like so next
you<00:02:41.240> bring<00:02:41.420> your<00:02:41.920> arms<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.100> like<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.640> your

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you bring your arms up like this your

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.520 
you bring your arms up like this your
elbows<00:02:44.470> effect<00:02:46.240> then<00:02:47.240> we<00:02:48.050> get<00:02:48.200> into<00:02:48.320> some

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
elbows effect then we get into some

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.320 
elbows effect then we get into some
finer<00:02:48.740> motions<00:02:49.250> moving<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> wrist<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:51.740> this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
finer motions moving the wrist like this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.230 
finer motions moving the wrist like this
back<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.510> forth<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.760> go<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.970> hand

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
back and forth then you go to hand

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.660 
back and forth then you go to hand
rotation<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:59.440> closing<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> palm<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:01.430> that's

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
rotation and closing the palm so that's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.040 
rotation and closing the palm so that's
typical<00:03:02.120> fingers<00:03:02.420> at<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.660> bottom<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.990> your

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
typical fingers at the bottom of your

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.100 
typical fingers at the bottom of your
home

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.830 

and<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.800> last<00:03:06.950> motion<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.360> finding<00:03:08.690> your

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and the last motion is just finding your

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.420 
and the last motion is just finding your
fingers

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.429 

the<00:03:18.269> next<00:03:18.569> stretch<00:03:18.719> is<00:03:18.780> I'd<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> show<00:03:19.379> you

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
the next stretch is I'd like to show you

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.229 
the next stretch is I'd like to show you
our<00:03:19.680> neural<00:03:20.069> stretches<00:03:20.519> which<00:03:20.790> are<00:03:20.969> a<00:03:21.180> little

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
our neural stretches which are a little

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.330 
our neural stretches which are a little
bit<00:03:21.569> different<00:03:21.930> than<00:03:22.079> muscle<00:03:22.500> stretches<00:03:22.980> but

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
bit different than muscle stretches but

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.789 
bit different than muscle stretches but
very<00:03:23.579> effective<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.780> first<00:03:25.019> stretch<00:03:25.260> will

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
very effective the first stretch will

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.160 
very effective the first stretch will
bring<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.189> arm<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.609> like<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.900> bend

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
bring your arm up like this and you bend

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.800 
bring your arm up like this and you bend
your<00:03:28.230> wrist<00:03:28.469> back<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.280> prop<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.299> up<00:03:30.540> against

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
your wrist back and prop it up against

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
your wrist back and prop it up against
the<00:03:30.959> walls<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.769> don't<00:03:31.950> hold<00:03:32.280> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the walls so that you don't hold it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.119 
the walls so that you don't hold it
there<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.109> drop<00:03:34.349> your<00:03:34.530> shoulder<00:03:34.950> down

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
there and you drop your shoulder down

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.849 
there and you drop your shoulder down
and<00:03:35.510> then<00:03:36.510> your<00:03:36.689> neck<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.379> opposite

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
and then your neck in the opposite

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.740 
and then your neck in the opposite
direction<00:03:38.040> will<00:03:39.030> give<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.269> really<00:03:39.629> nice

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
direction will give you really nice

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.530 
direction will give you really nice
stretch<00:03:40.139> hold<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.219> for<00:03:41.519> about<00:03:41.639> 30<00:03:42.060> seconds

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
stretch hold this for about 30 seconds

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.520 
stretch hold this for about 30 seconds
and<00:03:42.840> repeat<00:03:43.469> up<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.889> three<00:03:44.099> times<00:03:44.129> on<00:03:44.760> each<00:03:44.819> arm

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
and repeat up to three times on each arm

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.199 
and repeat up to three times on each arm
the<00:03:46.530> next<00:03:46.859> stretch<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.430> pretty<00:03:47.849> easy<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the next stretch is pretty easy to

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.789 
the next stretch is pretty easy to
remember<00:03:48.359> because<00:03:48.719> it's<00:03:49.079> based<00:03:49.260> off<00:03:49.439> of<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
remember because it's based off of the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.729 
remember because it's based off of the
four<00:03:50.010> eyes<00:03:50.189> motion<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.290> probably<00:03:52.290> made<00:03:52.560> when

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
four eyes motion that probably made when

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.339 
four eyes motion that probably made when
you're<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.889> little<00:03:53.010> kid<00:03:53.569> so<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.659> take<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.109> arm

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
you're a little kid so you take one arm

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.979 
you're a little kid so you take one arm
and<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.430> bring<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.879> up<00:03:57.030> with<00:03:57.629> your<00:03:57.750> palm

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
and you bring it up with your palm

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.770 
and you bring it up with your palm
upside<00:03:58.439> down<00:03:58.650> on<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:58.980> side<00:03:59.159> of<00:03:59.189> your<00:03:59.370> face

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
upside down on the side of your face

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.809 
upside down on the side of your face
dropping<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> shoulder<00:04:01.319> so<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.159> is<00:04:02.280> relaxed

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
dropping the shoulder so that is relaxed

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.440 
dropping the shoulder so that is relaxed
and<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:04.260> hold<00:04:04.439> this<00:04:04.590> also<00:04:04.859> for<00:04:05.189> 30<00:04:05.400> seconds<00:04:05.819> up

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
and you hold this also for 30 seconds up

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.920 
and you hold this also for 30 seconds up
to<00:04:06.629> three<00:04:06.840> times<00:04:07.099> on<00:04:08.099> each<00:04:08.159> arm<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:09.389> last<00:04:09.629> one

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to three times on each arm the last one

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.349 
to three times on each arm the last one
is<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:10.889> bit<00:04:10.980> tricky<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.579> have<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.209> show
