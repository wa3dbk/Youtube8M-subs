chaos zakum and then we have this badge

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.049 
chaos zakum and then we have this badge
which<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> poop<00:00:37.579> because<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.790> do

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
which is poop because I don't do

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
which is poop because I don't do
anything<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
anything with it I kind of just have it

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.310 
anything with it I kind of just have it
and<00:00:41.840> this<00:00:42.840> book<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.620> needed<00:00:43.860> upgrade<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
and this book which I needed upgrade and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.040 
and this book which I needed upgrade and
I<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> metal<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:51.050> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I have this metal or I do have this but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
I have this metal or I do have this but
like<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.219> don't<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.489> sometimes<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> says<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
like I don't know sometimes it says this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
like I don't know sometimes it says this
gives<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.410> but

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
gives more like it does right now but

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
gives more like it does right now but
also<00:00:59.160> sometimes<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> says<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.660> metal

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
also sometimes it says that this metal

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.140 
also sometimes it says that this metal
gives<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.090> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> confuses<00:01:04.049> me

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
gives more so that kind of confuses me

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
gives more so that kind of confuses me
but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> guess<00:01:06.750> I'll<00:01:07.049> wear<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.530> because

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but I guess I'll wear that one because

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.270 
but I guess I'll wear that one because
that<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.490> gets<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:11.010> my

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that one gets more now and then I got my

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.440 
that one gets more now and then I got my
nose<00:01:12.180> branch<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.490> about<00:01:14.490> five<00:01:15.270> percent

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
nose branch which is about five percent

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.070 
nose branch which is about five percent
int<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.700> yeah<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
int I think yeah and I got this which is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.980 
int I think yeah and I got this which is
poop<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.369> free<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.330> free

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
