00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.810
 after winning the league title the 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.450
 last campaign the captain of the real 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 madrid iker boxes aspires in this to 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.429
 much more we hope to take another step more 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.670
 as he had been doing during the two 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.010
 last seasons since the one that is 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.789
 is the mister of this murillo and good 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.009
 Well, aspire this year to follow 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.329
 consolidating the team to go one step further 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.500
 of responsibility plus experience and 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.810
 we hope we are again going back to 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.790
 win the grape league title 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.380
 we want to win the cup of the king we want 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.700
 first also win the supercopa of 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.800
 Spain to be held in the month of 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.970
 August and let's hope and we wish that 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.160
 after these years we know that 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.629
 now the doors of such a conviction 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.730
 pretty like the champions league we can 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.980
 get to reach the final because the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.960
 real madrid and this group of players 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.210
 they deserve a glass of europe 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.500
 Moscow the players there are with him and with 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.100
 the public with the field with the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.480
 coach with this team deserves a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.800
 European Cup but obviously as 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.820
 I thought about the rest of the players 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.560
 There are different teams level 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 of Europe 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.920
 I think the steps that are being taken 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.470
 are the ones that are left 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 we have managed in these 2 years to create 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.909
 a practically new team players 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
 very young with a lot of experience now 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.509
 because two years ago there were players 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.770
 as a civilian who still not maybe not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420
 has the recognition that they have now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.940
 as khedira 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 karim I think that two years of 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.530
 experience is very good and in that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.450
 meaning then positioning it as I say 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 all the steps that must be taken either 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 it's an obsession to be thinking about 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.729
 the tenth given that we first have to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.210
 think about what we have now in August 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.830
 which is the beginning of the league and a new 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 cup that is the supercopa of spain well 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.060
 have to fight and try to win the first 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 title of the season and to go 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.190
 reaching end there is more template than 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.549
 enough to compete in all 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.319
 competitions for me my team has been 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.940
 consolidated a very positive way in 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.300
 the last few years I think we have given a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 giant step that morgan step 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.320
 very big in the face of competing against a 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.750
 barcelona that came to make some 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 very good seasons and in that sense 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.720
 we have put ourselves together 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.270
 managed to win a cup to the king at a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.560
 final to Barcelona is true that we have 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 has other parties in which he has 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 touched suffer defeat but year passes 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.110
 a league will also be invoked 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.580
 competitive very difficult and that is armed 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.890
 and I think it was fair with a deserving 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.630
 her so this year we can like 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.900
 then the criteria that may have 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.070
 everyone is different, I can not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.020
 enter there what I do have clear is 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.640
 that my team for me my players are 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.200
 the best ones that I think with the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.790
 template there is yes that you can 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 compete in the three competitions that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 we have something of the year and in the supercopa 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 for different but 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 in some season that is very long 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 Well, I'm convinced that with this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.490
 template can be used by all three 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.500
 titles thanks in large part to the 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.870
 work by jose mourinho who according to 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.120
 squares is the architect of the change of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.650
 mentality and the club I think it's a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.990
 committed person I think it's a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.080
 person that gives a total turn to the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.670
 entity to the team has brought out the best in 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.709
 each player and has been able to compete 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.120
 there are many times those fears that 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.480
 we had because we came from years where 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.570
 we did not win anything and I think the club 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.150
 He was fully successful in hiring the coach 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.480
 but Madrid has a project in 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.160
 they are letting him do it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.620
 it feels very comfortable here so 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.780
 let's hope and we want it to be a point of 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.430
 inflection for Madrid and that ready 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.830
 but they last as long as we all wish 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.269
 that the castilla remains for many years 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.280
 the second division 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.260
 the promotions of the subsidiaries fill 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.910
 pride to a goalkeeper who came out of the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.090
 white factory I think for the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.400
 kids is something 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.980
 very very important because first they 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.849
 they will feel very competitive 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.090
 competition very different from the one 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.080
 they were used to and that leads to 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.940
 do much more mature 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.239
 so always that for the first 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.040
 team is going to be going to be paramount and 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.060
 pleased mostly by them for them 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.799
 because they are feeling more 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.349
 protagonists have been more important 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.360
 they are becoming more like players to 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.230
 level they are playing more competitions 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.890
 with the different selections 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.420
 lower with Real Madrid and that I 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.010
 I think it's good for the future 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 And I think that 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.200
 who are with us in the first 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.600
 team people of the quarry or jesus adam 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.169
 or me well that's important simple to the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.169
 people from the quarry
