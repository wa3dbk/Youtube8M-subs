00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.589
 you can also finally announce it ad 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.089
 you have to buy the home button twice and then you get at the bottom of one 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.250
 bar with all those programs that are active and so you can easily switch 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.730
 looking forward to 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.330
 that is also the ipod function is that the leftmost then you can 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.450
 just 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 control your ipod directly from 4 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.400
 And there is also a handsome tightened lock when you put it in 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.140
 the series 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.410
 it then it automatically stays upright 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.050
 6 If you mingle with people you can get your iPhone yes best 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.790
 join soccer faces 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 we understand what you found, you can also make folders with different efteling 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.409
 what do you do by touching on it and then on top of another bike 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.630
 lega nord power 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.730
 Well then explained with your husband 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.110
 and if you want you can also have more room there the iphone 5 7 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.020
 sietske h that his project has change power 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.330
 before that you also have a central inbox that all posts names of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.870
 give every opportunity 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.509
 but you can no longer watch them yourself if we look at us 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.369
 Also there are eleven groups per year, so if you have several in earlier 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.160
 if you have axes on a topic then it is not grouped 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160
 then you can get it right after each other 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.790
 the only disadvantage is that you cannot sing well what is from the other side 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.560
 for that you must get away by mail 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 an anonymous spokesperson 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.019
 the requirement of you can also create playlists game rules 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.169
 that has to be done through the itunes, I can always do it on my own 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.180
 and for that you do not have to be in line with agenda times according to nekema 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.099
 Preventing often becomes even a very fast one 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.389

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.709
 Israel is four times more in surman if you work on a tripod camera and you 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.799
 hits the picture 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.999
 yes the disc the inflow and outflow 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.139
 the quality left is not very much because if you zoom in strain 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.689
 you have to do with that 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.739
 but a small excerpt of the overall image that she got very pro from 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.930
 but we hope that in the iphone 4s it gets better because something per case 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.029
 higher resolution camera 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.799
 You can also connect a buffer keyboard to your iPhone once 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.939
 nice on that question and then enjoy a small screen it 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.139
 to use 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.069
 but yes it is of course also a way you have a point in the 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.479
 pocket 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.059
 probably that is not what is thought up for the ipad but you can 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.599
 so also for ajax than usual what is it 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.060
 a number of functions that it has added for it and certainly cannot be made anymore 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.169
 but they are very well executed 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
 such as from multitasking and improvement 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.829
 that is because a number of small adjustments were made in the tenth stage 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.650
 make general use of your iphone a lot stronger
