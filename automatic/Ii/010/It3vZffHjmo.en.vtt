00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
for parts and um the other day I popped

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
for parts and um the other day I popped
the<00:01:35.490> game<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.479> wouldn't<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the game back in and it just wouldn't it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
the game back in and it just wouldn't it
wouldn't<00:01:37.500> play<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
wouldn't play so I think one of the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
wouldn't play so I think one of the
previous<00:01:39.090> owners<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> game<00:01:39.840> actually<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
previous owners of the game actually you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560 
previous owners of the game actually you
know<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> Blockbuster<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.939> swap<00:01:42.390> out

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
know you go to Blockbuster and swap out

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.749 
know you go to Blockbuster and swap out
a<00:01:42.600> game<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> better<00:01:43.560> copy<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.430> think

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a game to get a better copy I think

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.889 
a game to get a better copy I think
that's<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.149> did<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> game

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that's what they did because the game

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
that's what they did because the game
does<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.110> work<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.100> take<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
does not work so I'm just gonna take it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.179
