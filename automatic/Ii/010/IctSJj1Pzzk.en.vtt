00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.240
 You have to be cute with penny I think 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.840

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.490
 the definition of cute yes is true but 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.490
 according to my experience you do not 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.699
 I 'm sorry sheldon almost sits me in your 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.300
 Thank you 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.460

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.140

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.140
 of a samurai 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.080
 it's not a caricature it 's anime 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.290

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.290

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.140
 a chocolate 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140
 without seeds 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.840
 hello here yes 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 you do not know what it is but in the second I will speak 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.420
 from the chocolate aisle 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.940
 all right 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.440
 I know what you're doing seriously that 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.240
 you use chocolate as a positive reinforcement 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.200
 for what you consider a good 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 behavior 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.939
 very well 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.560
 Now I want chocolate 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.849
 and the gift you can not train because not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.040
 you should not be able to please yourself 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.140
 leonard you were not happy with my 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.909
 previous way to treat it so I'm going to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.950
 use conditioning techniques 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.829
 operant based on Tom's works 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.329
 seiner within a week I think that 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.910
 it could be jumping out of the pool 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.270
 balancing a ball with your nose 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.980
 you will not pay this now I am 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.370
 suggesting that I'm really going to do it 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.670
 jump out of the pool 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.830
 ricker basin was implied 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.200
 I'm molding your personality by filing 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.130
 imperfections and so you prefer you do not go 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.370
 to file ap you're telling me 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.720
 prohibits the application of a protocol 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.020
 scientifically valid to improve 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.500
 our lives this is what you have 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.500
 prohibited 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.920
 but bad
