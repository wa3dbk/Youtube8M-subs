camera<00:00:33.210> setting<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.640> d-pad<00:00:35.640> right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
camera setting which is the d-pad right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.380 
camera setting which is the d-pad right
here<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.190> I'll<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> mission

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
here so I'll have to go into a mission

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
here so I'll have to go into a mission
right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> control<00:00:44.489> method

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
right now but that is the control method

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.860 
right now but that is the control method
that<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.030> available<00:00:45.239> back<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> PSP<00:00:46.230> so

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
that was available back on the PSP so

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.369 
that was available back on the PSP so
it's<00:00:48.870> fairly<00:00:50.030> hard<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.870> you've<00:00:52.079> never

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it's fairly hard to use if you've never

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's fairly hard to use if you've never
played<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> game<00:00:53.100> before<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:54.590> if<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:55.800> honest

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
played the game before but if I'm honest

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.970 
played the game before but if I'm honest
it<00:00:56.309> does<00:00:56.879> offer<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.480> control<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.320> B<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it does offer a lot of control or B it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
it does offer a lot of control or B it
does<00:00:59.430> sacrifice<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.780> control<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
does sacrifice a bit of control the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
does sacrifice a bit of control the
player<00:01:04.379> house<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.360> d-pad

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
right buttons to the right analog stick

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.160 
right buttons to the right analog stick
as<00:01:48.619> as<00:01:49.619> shown<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.460> unfortunately<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
as as shown right now unfortunately you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.480 
as as shown right now unfortunately you
still<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> use<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:55.490> look

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
still need to use up and down to look

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.429 
still need to use up and down to look
and<00:01:56.880> change<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.479> perspective<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.229> that's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and change your perspective but that's

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.749 
and change your perspective but that's
not<00:01:58.649> too<00:01:58.799> much<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> problem<00:01:59.490> because

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
not too much of a problem because

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.080 
not too much of a problem because
nothing<00:02:00.479> else<00:02:00.600> over<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.439> used<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.280> those

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
nothing else over here is used so those

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.010 
nothing else over here is used so those
buttons<00:02:03.570> right<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.229> way<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:06.020> if

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
buttons right out the way and also if

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
buttons right out the way and also if
you<00:02:07.500> accidentally<00:02:07.950> press<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> analog

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you accidentally press up on the analog

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.350 
you accidentally press up on the analog
stick<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> doesn't<00:02:10.140> change<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.360> perspective

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
stick it doesn't change the perspective

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.690 
stick it doesn't change the perspective
of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
of

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.530 
of
camera<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:14.400> thinking<00:02:15.400> back<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.970> using

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
camera so thinking back on this using

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.740 
camera so thinking back on this using
the<00:02:17.379> left<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> right<00:02:18.700> buttons<00:02:19.090> aside<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the left and right buttons aside to the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.080 
the left and right buttons aside to the
d-pad<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.440> probably<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> best<00:02:21.190> method<00:02:21.519> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
d-pad is probably the best method and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.360 
d-pad is probably the best method and
the<00:02:22.900> third<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.230> final<00:02:23.290> method<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:26.370> assigning

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the third and final method is assigning

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.509 
the third and final method is assigning
the<00:02:27.819> entire<00:02:28.450> d-pad<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.800> stick

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
the entire d-pad to the right stick

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.880 
the entire d-pad to the right stick

the up and down controls now this can be

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.520 
the up and down controls now this can be
fairly<00:02:38.200> annoying<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:39.720> since<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.989> unlock

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
fairly annoying because since the unlock

sticks<00:02:41.799> easy<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.370> move<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.120> accidentally

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
sticks easy to move you can accidentally

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.759 
sticks easy to move you can accidentally
slip<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:45.069> will<00:02:45.220> change<00:02:45.459> perspective<00:02:46.769> so

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
slip and it will change perspective so

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.530 
slip and it will change perspective so
out<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.220> all<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.519> them<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> probably<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
out of all of them this is probably the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.050 
out of all of them this is probably the
second<00:02:49.989> best<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.500> my<00:02:50.680> personal<00:02:51.310> favorite<00:02:51.370> is

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
second best but my personal favorite is

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.839 
second best but my personal favorite is
just<00:02:52.239> using<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.049> d-pad<00:02:53.470> left<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.700> right

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
just using the d-pad left and right

buttons to the right stick

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.699 
buttons to the right stick
now<00:02:57.489> if<00:02:57.760> doing<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.870> makes<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> play<00:02:59.680> like

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
