00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
is Daisy and virtue and I just logged

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
is Daisy and virtue and I just logged
into<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> server<00:00:31.529> i<00:00:31.710> literally<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.070> bought

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
into the server i literally just bought

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.959 
into the server i literally just bought
right<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.260> spawned<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.320> within<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
right there and i spawned on within a

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.049 
right there and i spawned on within a
kak<00:00:35.969> s<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:37.829> guessing<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> pvp

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
kak s so I'm guessing this is like a pvp

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.840 
kak s so I'm guessing this is like a pvp
server<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.540> lots<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> vehicles<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.850> whatnot

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
server with lots of vehicles and whatnot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
server with lots of vehicles and whatnot
and<00:00:42.770> yeah<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.219> Daisy

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and yeah if you don't know what Daisy
