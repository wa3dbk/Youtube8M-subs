the<00:03:54.420> mouse<00:03:54.570> was<00:03:54.750> tiny<00:03:55.080> compared<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.680> my<00:03:55.800> hand

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
the mouse was tiny compared to my hand

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.620 
the mouse was tiny compared to my hand
and<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.550> one's<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.209> right<00:03:57.300> size<00:03:57.570> for

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630
