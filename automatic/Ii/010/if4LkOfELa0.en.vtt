00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it is quite simple but it does take a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910 
it is quite simple but it does take a
bit<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> practice<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.960> does<00:00:10.200> take<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
bit of practice and it does take a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.940 
bit of practice and it does take a
little<00:00:11.130> bit<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.460> maneuvering<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.950> adjusting

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
little bit of maneuvering and adjusting

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.799

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
bigger the bow will be so just depends

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.740 
bigger the bow will be so just depends
on<00:00:39.629> your<00:00:39.690> size<00:00:40.379> preference<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.450> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
style you want you don't have to have

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
style you want you don't have to have
your<00:00:44.789> fringe<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.390> bang<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
your fringe or bang that like I do you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
your fringe or bang that like I do you
can<00:00:47.160> tie<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.520> into<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.570> long<00:00:48.899> enough

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
can tie them into if there long enough

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.310 
can tie them into if there long enough
but<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.879> quite<00:00:51.149> nice<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.230> have

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
but I think it's quite nice to just have

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.639 
but I think it's quite nice to just have
it<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.610> here's<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> show<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:55.110> tutorial

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
it out so here's the show this tutorial
works<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.129> better<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.520> you're<00:00:56.640> using<00:00:56.820> hair

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
works a lot better if you're using hair

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
works a lot better if you're using hair
that<00:00:57.360> hasn't<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.020> been<00:00:58.289> washed<00:00:58.530> today<00:00:59.100> is

that hasn't just been washed today is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
that hasn't just been washed today is
the<00:00:59.399> day<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.850> need<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> wash<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.510> hair<00:01:00.840> and

the day that I need to wash my hair and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.399 
the day that I need to wash my hair and

it works perfectly to sit up there I've
just<00:01:04.799> used<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.519> cheap<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
just used some really cheap as to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.929 
just used some really cheap as to
hairspray<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.530> comb<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.760> use<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
hairspray just a comb you can use a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
hairspray just a comb you can use a
brush<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> smooth

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
brush if you need to it's just to smooth

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.510 
brush if you need to it's just to smooth
out<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> hair<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.810> ponytail<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.799> then

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
out the hair into a ponytail and then

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
out the hair into a ponytail and then
some<00:01:15.180> hair<00:01:15.420> bands<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:17.540> some<00:01:18.540> groups<00:01:19.080> hair

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
some hair bands and some groups hair

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.359 
some hair bands and some groups hair
grips<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.630> probably<00:01:22.170> best<00:01:22.680> stuff<00:01:23.100> with

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
grips so it's probably best stuff with

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.630 
grips so it's probably best stuff with
her<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> needs<00:01:23.939> washing<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.580> a

where<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> position<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.360> pain<00:02:03.600> tail

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.640 

you<00:02:23.239> can<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> upside<00:02:23.870> down<00:02:24.290> if<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> need

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
you can do this upside down if you need

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.190 
you can do this upside down if you need
t<00:02:25.010> cuz<00:02:25.250> it's<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.519> bit<00:02:25.670> easier<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.300> time<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
t cuz it's a bit easier to time a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:48.479 
t cuz it's a bit easier to time a
ponytail<00:02:46.299> I'm<00:02:47.299> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> grab<00:02:47.569> two<00:02:47.870> hair<00:02:48.170> ties

ponytail I'm going to grab two hair ties

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.949 
ponytail I'm going to grab two hair ties
because<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.849> don't<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.209> one<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.660> strong

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
because I don't think one is strong

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.830 
because I don't think one is strong
enough<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.769> going<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> tie<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
enough and I'm just going to tie the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.979 
enough and I'm just going to tie the
painter<00:02:54.290> up<00:02:54.640> into<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.989> loop<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:58.900> so<00:03:01.720> now<00:03:02.720> I

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
painter up into a loop like so now I

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.110 
painter up into a loop like so now I
would<00:03:03.230> spray<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.799> again<00:03:05.110> spread<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.260> loop

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
would spray this again spread the loop

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.830 
would spray this again spread the loop
and<00:03:08.120> then<00:03:09.640> wait<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.670> little<00:03:10.849> bit<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.299> can<00:03:11.540> make

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
and then wait a little bit you can make

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.410 
and then wait a little bit you can make
the<00:03:12.049> loop<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.410> big<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.220> want<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.700> or<00:03:14.239> as

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the loop as big as you want to or as

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.000 
the loop as big as you want to or as
small<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.900> want<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.799> size

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
small as you want to this is the size

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
small as you want to this is the size
i'm<00:03:16.280> using<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.239> first<00:03:17.450> thing<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.810> going

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
i'm using the first thing you're going

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.199 
i'm using the first thing you're going
to<00:03:17.989> do<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.440> just<00:03:18.620> put<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.100> down<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.970> side

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
to do is just put it down to the side

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.900 
to do is just put it down to the side
like<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:21.290> makes<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.799> ring<00:03:22.100> let's

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
like this that makes like a ring let's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.210 
like this that makes like a ring let's
pull<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.840> side<00:03:24.079> down<00:03:24.290> first<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.620> take<00:03:28.160> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
pull this side down first and take a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:39.340 
pull this side down first and take a
grip<00:03:29.829> pin<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:32.650> same<00:03:33.650> on<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:33.920> outside

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:47.280 

hey<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.220> bull<00:03:41.230> split<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.260> down<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.650> center

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.170 

make<00:03:48.290> sure<00:03:48.320> it's<00:03:48.620> about<00:03:48.770> even<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.490> form<00:03:49.760> two

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
make sure it's about even to form two

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.280 
make sure it's about even to form two
sides<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.720> boat<00:03:52.810> then<00:03:53.810> you're<00:03:54.080> going<00:03:54.230> to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
sides of the boat then you're going to

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.430 
sides of the boat then you're going to
take<00:03:54.560> this<00:03:55.150> bit<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.330> stuck<00:03:56.720> out<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.200> tail

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
take this bit that stuck out this tail

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.730 
take this bit that stuck out this tail
piece<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.360> wrap<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.570> over<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.260> top<00:04:02.740> sometimes

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
piece and wrap it over the top sometimes

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.080 
piece and wrap it over the top sometimes
this<00:04:04.190> needs<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.520> little<00:04:04.700> bit<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.880> hairspray<00:04:05.120> too

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
this needs a little bit of hairspray too

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.940 
this needs a little bit of hairspray too
so<00:04:08.090> just<00:04:08.270> pull<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.870> over<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.380> top<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
so just pull that over the top of the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:22.580 
so just pull that over the top of the
bow<00:04:13.030> pin<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.270> down<00:04:14.300> t

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.920 

and<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.730> want<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.030> adjust<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:26.930> like

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and then you just want to adjust it like

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.379 
and then you just want to adjust it like
if<00:04:28.230> any<00:04:28.470> bits<00:04:28.770> like<00:04:28.980> this<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.520> coming<00:04:29.880> under<00:04:30.210> and

if any bits like this I coming under and

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:40.080 
if any bits like this I coming under and
just<00:04:31.340> get<00:04:32.340> another<00:04:32.520> pin

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.540 

and<00:04:40.510> then<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.320> pro<00:04:41.680> I'm<00:04:42.040> just<00:04:42.220> going<00:04:42.460> to

stick<00:04:44.550> stick<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> pin<00:04:45.940> down<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.480> back<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:47.020> this

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
stick stick a pin down the back of this

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.450 
stick stick a pin down the back of this
bit<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.830> keep<00:04:50.979> it<00:04:51.190> waited<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.900> not<00:04:53.020> enough

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
bit to keep it waited it's not enough

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
put in more you want to use pins that at

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.000 
put in more you want to use pins that at
the<00:04:57.850> same<00:04:58.000> color<00:04:58.360> as<00:04:58.540> your<00:04:58.570> hair<00:04:58.900> but<00:04:59.800> these
