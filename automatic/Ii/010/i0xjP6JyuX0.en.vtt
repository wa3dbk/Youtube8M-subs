our<00:01:14.950> new<00:01:15.160> LG<00:01:15.430> webOS<00:01:16.210> was<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.840> build<00:01:17.050> an

our new LG webOS was to build an

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.560 
our new LG webOS was to build an
amusement<00:01:17.619> park<00:01:17.650> we<00:01:18.520> first<00:01:18.850> asked<00:01:19.270> what<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
amusement park we first asked what the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.390 
amusement park we first asked what the
most<00:01:19.750> important<00:01:20.290> aspect<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.800> an<00:01:20.950> amusement

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
most important aspect of an amusement

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.490 
most important aspect of an amusement
park<00:01:21.460> would<00:01:21.820> be<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.780> most<00:01:22.960> important

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
park would be and the most important

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.260 
park would be and the most important
thing<00:01:23.680> was<00:01:23.920> being<00:01:24.160> able<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.580> ride<00:01:24.790> whatever

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
thing was being able to ride whatever

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.109 
thing was being able to ride whatever
you<00:01:25.420> want<00:01:25.660> without<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> weight<00:01:26.440> also<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you want without the weight also the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.120 
you want without the weight also the
rides<00:01:28.360> had<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:28.960> close<00:01:29.200> proximity<00:01:29.650> so

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
rides had to be in close proximity so

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.350 
rides had to be in close proximity so
that<00:01:30.280> they<00:01:30.400> can<00:01:30.580> be<00:01:30.610> on<00:01:30.820> another<00:01:31.150> ride

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
that they can be on another ride

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200 
that they can be on another ride
instantly<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:32.710> created<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.280> smart<00:01:33.550> TV<00:01:33.729> around

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
instantly we created a smart TV around

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.620 
instantly we created a smart TV around
this<00:01:34.360> idea<00:01:34.920> LG<00:01:35.920> webOS<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.759> like<00:01:37.000> an<00:01:37.149> amusement

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
this idea LG webOS is like an amusement

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.110 
this idea LG webOS is like an amusement
