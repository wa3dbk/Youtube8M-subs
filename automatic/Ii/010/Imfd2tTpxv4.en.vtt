00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
of this here these guys go to chopper up

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.300 
of this here these guys go to chopper up
in<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> air<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:30.290> rate<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.560> finally

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
in the air and the rate is finally

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.250 
in the air and the rate is finally
starting<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.700> slow<00:04:34.540> speed<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> tide<00:04:36.020> is

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
starting to slow speed of the tide is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.890 
starting to slow speed of the tide is
slowing<00:04:36.650> does<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.190> touch<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:41.060> water<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.480> still

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
slowing does to touch the water is still

00:04:41.900 --> 00:05:43.360 
slowing does to touch the water is still
coming<00:04:42.230> in

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.740 

so<00:05:44.370> if<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.580> just<00:05:44.820> spin<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.150> biggest<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.690> the

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
so if I just spin the biggest of the

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.500 
so if I just spin the biggest of the
waves<00:05:49.970> what<00:05:50.970> was<00:05:51.120> that

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
waves what was that

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.650 
waves what was that
they're<00:05:52.290> letting<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.770> sailboat<00:05:53.310> come<00:05:53.910> in<00:05:54.270> they

they're letting a sailboat come in they
said<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:55.200> after<00:05:55.650> that<00:05:55.770> they<00:05:56.010> got<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.250> close<00:05:56.490> it

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
said and after that they got to close it

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.940 
said and after that they got to close it
off<00:05:56.850> but<00:05:57.810> they're<00:05:57.960> letting<00:05:58.200> this<00:05:58.260> guy<00:05:58.500> come<00:05:58.770> in

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
off but they're letting this guy come in

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:25.219 
off but they're letting this guy come in
they<00:05:59.100> said<00:05:59.310> good<00:05:59.910> luck<00:06:01.730> Wow

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229

so<00:06:26.229> oh<00:06:26.680> here<00:06:27.669> comes<00:06:27.819> island<00:06:28.210> packets<00:06:28.599> it<00:06:28.750> just

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
so oh here comes island packets it just

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:39.209 
so oh here comes island packets it just
made<00:06:29.110> it<00:06:29.229> in<00:06:32.550> yeah<00:06:37.710> alright<00:06:38.710> it<00:06:38.830> looks<00:06:39.039> like

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
made it in yeah alright it looks like

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.589 
made it in yeah alright it looks like
we're<00:06:39.400> getting<00:06:39.460> a<00:06:39.669> little<00:06:39.819> bit<00:06:40.030> of<00:06:40.150> a<00:06:40.240> slack

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
we're getting a little bit of a slack

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.020 
we're getting a little bit of a slack
right<00:06:40.930> now<00:06:41.169> and<00:06:41.819> the<00:06:42.819> height<00:06:43.270> of<00:06:43.509> the<00:06:44.259> pilings

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
right now and the height of the pilings

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.360 
right now and the height of the pilings
is<00:06:46.030> just<00:06:46.780> about<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.379> its<00:06:47.530> highest<00:06:47.770> point

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
is just about to its highest point

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.050 
is just about to its highest point
although<00:06:48.849> it<00:06:49.389> may<00:06:49.569> continue<00:06:50.080> up<00:06:50.259> higher<00:06:51.060> but

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
although it may continue up higher but

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.490 
although it may continue up higher but
you<00:06:52.180> can<00:06:52.330> see<00:06:52.569> the<00:06:52.719> height<00:06:52.870> of<00:06:52.990> the<00:06:53.050> pilots

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
you can see the height of the pilots

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.469 
you can see the height of the pilots
right<00:06:53.770> now<00:06:53.979> we'll<00:06:54.370> see<00:06:54.550> how<00:06:54.699> much<00:06:54.819> we<00:06:55.000> dip<00:06:55.240> back

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
right now we'll see how much we dip back

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.110 
right now we'll see how much we dip back
down<00:06:56.009> we<00:06:57.009> should<00:06:57.039> maybe<00:06:57.310> put<00:06:57.400> a<00:06:57.580> marble<00:06:57.909> on<00:06:58.090> the

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
down we should maybe put a marble on the

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.370 
down we should maybe put a marble on the
pilings<00:06:59.610> see<00:07:00.610> where<00:07:00.789> we're<00:07:00.940> at

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.000 

I<00:07:05.000> did
