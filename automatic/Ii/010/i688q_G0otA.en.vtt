00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.350 
you happen have a rotary cutter that
even<00:02:04.040> makes<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:04.820> quite<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> bit<00:02:06.050> faster

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
even makes it go quite a bit faster

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
even makes it go quite a bit faster
unless<00:02:08.360> your<00:02:08.780> rotary<00:02:09.110> cutter<00:02:09.200> needs<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.460> be

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
unless your rotary cutter needs to be

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.400 
unless your rotary cutter needs to be
switched<00:02:10.910> out<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.150> blade<00:02:11.360> like<00:02:11.750> mine<00:02:12.020> does<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
switched out a blade like mine does you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.650 
switched out a blade like mine does you
might<00:02:12.560> not<00:02:12.770> get<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.490> your<00:02:13.700> strands<00:02:14.300> cut<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
might not get all your strands cut the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.990 
might not get all your strands cut the
right<00:02:14.810> way<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.040> made<00:02:16.250> quite<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> few<00:02:16.820> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
right way but I made quite a few of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.100 
right way but I made quite a few of
these<00:02:17.120> recently<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.200> after<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.740> while<00:02:18.860> um<00:02:20.110> my

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
these recently and after a while um my

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.690 
these recently and after a while um my
hands<00:02:21.590> started<00:02:22.070> hurting<00:02:22.280> from<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
hands started hurting from all the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.410 
hands started hurting from all the
cutting<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> rotary<00:02:23.570> cutter<00:02:24.010> definitely

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
cutting so a rotary cutter definitely

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.470 
cutting so a rotary cutter definitely
makes<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.780> process<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.620> little<00:02:27.800> bit<00:02:28.010> faster

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
makes the process go a little bit faster

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.729 
makes the process go a little bit faster
um<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:29.989> really<00:02:30.140> simple<00:02:30.410> project

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
um but this is a really simple project

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.920 
um but this is a really simple project
to<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.060> while<00:02:32.270> you're<00:02:32.390> watching<00:02:32.510> TV

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
do it in the car can be a variety of

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
pulled and I saw my top part where I

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.790 
pulled and I saw my top part where I
didn't<00:02:44.660> cut<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.989> way<00:02:45.110> through<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.620> that's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
didn't cut all the way through so that's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830 
didn't cut all the way through so that's
the<00:02:45.920> part<00:02:46.130> where<00:02:46.280> you're<00:02:46.430> going<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.700> gather<00:02:46.850> so

the part where you're going to gather so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.780 
the part where you're going to gather so
once<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.380> done<00:02:48.410> pulling<00:02:49.100> you're<00:02:49.640> gonna

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
once you're done pulling you're gonna

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.500 
once you're done pulling you're gonna
gather<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:51.200> section<00:02:51.590> together<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:53.360> is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
gather that section together and this is

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.120 
gather that section together and this is
the<00:02:53.660> section<00:02:53.900> that's<00:02:54.200> gonna<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:54.680> covered

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
the section that's gonna get covered

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.540 
the section that's gonna get covered
then<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.640> see<00:02:55.970> um<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.100> can<00:02:58.250> keep<00:02:58.400> on

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
then you don't see um so you can keep on

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.479 
then you don't see um so you can keep on
pulling<00:02:58.820> if<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> make<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.660> longer

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
pulling if you want to make it longer

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.890 
pulling if you want to make it longer
now<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.549> can<00:03:01.820> cover<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.269> whatever<00:03:02.600> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
now you can cover it with whatever you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.280 
now you can cover it with whatever you
want

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
want

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.250 
want
I<00:03:03.380> chose<00:03:04.160> that's<00:03:04.820> kind<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.209> navy<00:03:05.450> blue<00:03:05.870> color

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
I chose that's kind of a navy blue color

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.509 
I chose that's kind of a navy blue color
and<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.190> had<00:03:07.430> some<00:03:08.320> tie<00:03:09.320> dyed<00:03:09.530> fabric<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
and so I had some tie dyed fabric but I

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.580 
and so I had some tie dyed fabric but I
had<00:03:10.640> tie-dye<00:03:10.880> well<00:03:11.209> by<00:03:11.450> back<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.260> had<00:03:12.410> some

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
had tie-dye well by back that I had some

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.800 
had tie-dye well by back that I had some
extras<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.940> I'm<00:03:14.090> going<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.299> use<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.570> to

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
extras of so I'm going to use that to

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.210 
extras of so I'm going to use that to
cover<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.230> thought<00:03:15.440> it'd<00:03:15.620> be<00:03:15.739> kind<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.010> fun

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
cover it I thought it'd be kind of fun

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.140 
cover it I thought it'd be kind of fun
have<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> variation<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.769> color<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.190> pattern<00:03:19.519> so

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
have a variation in color and pattern so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.880 
have a variation in color and pattern so
basically<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.080> gonna<00:03:21.470> wrap<00:03:21.709> it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
basically you're just gonna wrap it

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.539 
basically you're just gonna wrap it
around<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.250> couple<00:03:22.430> times<00:03:22.549> until<00:03:24.489> until<00:03:25.489> you

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
around a couple times until until you

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.170 
around a couple times until until you
have<00:03:26.230> your<00:03:27.230> section<00:03:27.890> covered<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.910> then<00:03:29.060> you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
have your section covered and then you

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.270 
have your section covered and then you
just<00:03:29.390> go<00:03:29.540> ahead<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.959> tie<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:30.709> easy<00:03:30.950> no

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
