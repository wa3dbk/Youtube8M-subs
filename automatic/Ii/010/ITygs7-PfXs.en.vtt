 hi all all good I come to my channel 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.660
 in this video I'm going to show you some 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.280
 little purchases that one day the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.109
 Sea flower shop tell you that it's going to 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.430
 be a very very fast video because they are 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.920
 very little things 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.199
 specifically I bought three lipsticks and a 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.789
 eyeliner tell you that the truth is 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.740
 that the day I went I had you quite 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.289
 lucky because there were the little things 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.850
 three times two and in this case I 'm taking 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.340
 three lipsticks only for engravings 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.260
 so it's great so good 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.180
 tell you that if you want to see how 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.039
 each one of the lipsticks are left 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.200
 in me each of the tones and all those 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.850
 little things left to know him and the first 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.920
 labial kos taught is this that leads 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.630
 applied right now so powerful the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.360
 I really do not know how to describe if it's a 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.860
 dark red shooting brown brown 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.840
 throwing red the truth is that it is a 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.149
 quite peculiar heat and pretty 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.649
 dark as you can be observing the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.870
 truth is that this lipstick I 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.820
 I bought because of Maria del Canal Air 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 and move and a video that he made that was 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.600
 something like my 5 powerful lipsticks or 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.719
 something like that something of that style and 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.810
 I got this lipstick from here that said 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.909
 besides that it looked something like dib besides 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.020
 the skin that I love and I'm super 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.390
 in love 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.700
 to have but when I went to buy it 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.649
 I was exhausted and the truth is that as you can see 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.880
 that looked a lot like it was running 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.679
 as soon as I saw the video of Maria to 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.689
 buy me what a super nice color 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.360
 it is supposedly an edition 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.840
 limited although I when I was still 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.409
 was still this is in the tone of that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.850
 14 is called rise of modern city and the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.670
 truth is that I think it's a packaging 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.469
 beautiful is a super super nice color 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.079
 as I say is a heat not suitable for 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.729
 discreet and good what applied with a 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.619
 Here liner such colors 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.720
 so dark they should be used with a 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.099
 eyeliner specifically used this 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.849
 of the brand believes that it is the white brand 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.349
 of supermarkets consumed at number 8 and 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.720
 well the truth is that I like 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:01.149
 very much yes it is true that it is not 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.909
 to put it every day good according to 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.489
 taste the truth is a very very color 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.769
 nice dark I think it's super 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.200
 super nice and already I really 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.660
 love is a lipstick that takes very 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 Comfortable is very creamy with a matte finish 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.329
 but nothing dries lips last 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 very much has also the lip so 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.470
 I think it 's 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.140
 great and the one that I have right now 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 applied is this here that is if I do not 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.069
 wrong of the range more than the floor 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.480
 marc is from the revolution profile range 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.109
 list and it's in the tone that r-15 incognito 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.290
 a pick this this rosita from here clarito 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.359
 It is a clear little pink as I say very 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.819
 very natural for every day is a 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.849
 Rosita therefore striking for any clothes 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.409
 any time of the year as you see is 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.590
 we pretty much believe milestone despite having 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.940
 a matte finish is pretty we believe milestone 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.670
 Tell me what I have had it applied 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.310
 with a profiler I carry the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.340
 profiler number 01 of the brand I believed 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.730
 that he believed is the white mark of consumption 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.500
 Consum supermarket while teaching 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.730
 a video in which he taught some of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 these profiler is that I had 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.099
 cost only one euro reduced is 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.930
 consul so these two products the 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.120
 true that they combine quite well and as 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.730
 I say I think a color rosita accredited 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.110
 very nice for every day is not a 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630
 lipstick for nothing 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.340
 dry that has not ended as I say as 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.470
 but do not kill these matte quisquete 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.670
 air so the lips for nothing is a 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.770
 labial quite comfortable to wear 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.350
 pretty creamy yes it's true that it's not 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.120
 it has a super super good durability 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.770
 but the truth is that it leaves as a 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.660
 I had little lips especially 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.510
 the darker tones I can not 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.630
 ensure that lasts a lot I have to 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.240
 this range of reforming some that others 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.490
 and those that are darker shades stain the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.230
 lip and leave a very beautiful color 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.020
 so the truth is that I liked it 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.910
 a lot this color and it's pretty beautiful and 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.580
 the last things that I bought myself in bloom 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.470
 sea ​​were a lip liner and a 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.480
 lipstick of this style that the truth is 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.820
 I do not know exactly what range 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.180
 it belongs but that is also how the 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.890
 Previous matte finish comment that no 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.810
 I had never tasted an eyeliner 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
 normal brand had already heard about 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.390
 very good about them this concretely 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.970
 it's in the tone 229 what called me the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.640
 attention of this delineator is that it is 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.350
 waterproof waterproof that is resistant to 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.729
 water caught my attention the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.350
 truth is that the durability that has 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.720
 It's pretty good 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.720
 this nice because it's a nice like that 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.880
 clarito is between a brownish rosette 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.070
 brownish very much of the style that to me 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.050
 I like this type of 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.150
 tonalities for my lips that are 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.130
 rosaditos with a little bit of brown like that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 very very clear the truth is that it is 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.960
 pretty good it's convenient to apply and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.330
 another little thing that I shrugged that was the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.540
 last then this lipstick here as os 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:05:00.270
 I say this is from the range of cashmere looks 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:03.570
 list and it is and it is in the tone of c 36 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.000
 it's called natural rose word and it's about 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.730
 a pink as with a tonito so a 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.150
 little bit orange the truth is that it is 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.710
 a pretty pretty color so I have 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.450
 a lot of lies I'm telling you that 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.580
 I have no similar tone for whom 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.700
 surely it will have a similar tone and not 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.320
 I know but it's not the typical lipstick 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.630
 I usually only have more time 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.390
 it's pinkish pinkish brown but that's 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.910
 this orange pink style at the most 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.059
 some half alike I have one of 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.550
 mercadona I do not know if it is in the tone 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:37.529
 16 6 or 9 or something like that I do not remember 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.900
 exactly but the truth is that this 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.439
 It is much more beautiful like the 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.879
 previous this is taught is a finish 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:47.039
 supposedly mate but that's pretty 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:50.009
 creamy does not dry at all on the lips 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.399
 It is super convenient to use and also that 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.080
 the paper and I find it beautiful and good 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.249
 so far today's video I hope that 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.169
 I liked that it seemed 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.699
 interesting and entertaining as always 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.529
 I say you liked it you can give me 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.309
