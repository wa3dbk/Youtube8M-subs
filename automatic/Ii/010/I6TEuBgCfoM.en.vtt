for Randall's and usually when I do go

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
for Randall's and usually when I do go
to<00:01:07.860> Randall's<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.850> either<00:01:09.570> they're<00:01:09.900> sold

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to Randall's it's either they're sold

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020

the<00:01:39.360> yeast<00:01:40.009> okay<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.369> trick<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.000> measuring

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the yeast okay so my trick for measuring

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.950 
the yeast okay so my trick for measuring
honey<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.439> whenever<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.130> take<00:01:44.340> your

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
honey is whenever you take your

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
honey is whenever you take your
tablespoon<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.439> take<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.040> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tablespoon you take a little bit of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
tablespoon you take a little bit of
vegetable<00:01:47.520> oil<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.119> spray<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
vegetable oil and just spray it and that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
vegetable oil and just spray it and that
way<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> honey<00:01:49.860> won't<00:01:50.040> stick<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.579> much<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.030> I'm

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
way the honey won't stick as much so I'm

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
way the honey won't stick as much so I'm
just<00:01:51.210> gonna<00:01:51.360> spray<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:54.740> again<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> calls

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
just gonna spray this again so it calls

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.669 
just gonna spray this again so it calls
for<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.700> tablespoon<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.810> honey

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.740 

and<00:02:06.679> as<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:07.100> see<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.939> won't<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.509> doesn't

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
and as you can see it won't it doesn't

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.470 
and as you can see it won't it doesn't
stick<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.930> majority<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.830> out

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
stick so you get a majority of it out

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.240 
stick so you get a majority of it out
see<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.629> there's<00:02:14.810> hardly<00:02:15.080> any<00:02:15.379> in<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:16.040> if

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
see so there's hardly any in there if

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.720 
see so there's hardly any in there if
actually<00:02:16.910> there's<00:02:17.209> none<00:02:19.060> okay<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.299> then<00:02:20.510> also

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
actually there's none okay and then also

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
actually there's none okay and then also
you<00:02:22.730> guys<00:02:22.849> can<00:02:22.910> see<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:24.650> cup<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.220> warm<00:02:25.549> water

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.210 

just<00:02:29.000> doing<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.269> all<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.049> sand<00:02:30.349> mixer

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:55.569 

dry<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:52.280> five<00:02:52.519> minutes<00:02:52.790> okay<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.319> now<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
dry for five minutes okay so now the

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.520 
dry for five minutes okay so now the
yeast<00:02:56.090> has<00:02:56.359> been<00:02:56.540> activated<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.290> I'm<00:02:57.379> not

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
yeast has been activated and I'm not

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.500 
yeast has been activated and I'm not
sure<00:02:57.650> if<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.799> can<00:02:57.950> tell<00:02:58.069> but<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:59.239> because

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
sure if you can tell but it's because

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.910 
sure if you can tell but it's because
there's<00:02:59.629> a<00:02:59.690> little<00:02:59.840> bit<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.079> foam<00:03:00.319> here<00:03:00.349> on<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there's a little bit of foam here on the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.059 
there's a little bit of foam here on the
top<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.730> means<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.090> activated<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.379> next

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
top that means it's activated so next

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.229 
top that means it's activated so next
thing<00:03:04.160> we're<00:03:04.370> gonna<00:03:04.459> do<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.670> we're<00:03:04.940> gonna<00:03:05.000> take

the<00:03:17.090> recipe<00:03:17.389> calls<00:03:17.660> for<00:03:17.780> bread<00:03:18.170> flour<00:03:18.859> but

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the recipe calls for bread flour but

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.409 
the recipe calls for bread flour but
I've<00:03:19.310> never<00:03:19.459> used<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.880> I've<00:03:20.000> always<00:03:20.180> use

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
I've never used it I've always use

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.870 
I've never used it I've always use
all-purpose<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.950> I'm<00:03:22.099> wondering<00:03:22.310> if<00:03:22.700> I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
all-purpose and I'm wondering if I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.839 
all-purpose and I'm wondering if I
should<00:03:22.910> try<00:03:23.389> using<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.049> with<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.349> bread<00:03:24.530> flour

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
should try using it with the bread flour

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.460 
should try using it with the bread flour
I<00:03:25.849> wonder<00:03:26.329> if<00:03:26.419> it'll<00:03:26.569> make<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.989> bread<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.440> a

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
I wonder if it'll make the bread like a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.780 
I wonder if it'll make the bread like a
little<00:03:27.680> bit<00:03:27.799> softer<00:03:28.190> because<00:03:28.400> one<00:03:28.549> thing<00:03:28.700> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
little bit softer because one thing I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.030 
little bit softer because one thing I
have<00:03:29.060> noticed<00:03:29.329> is<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:30.079> it's<00:03:30.500> only<00:03:30.650> good

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
have noticed is that it's only good

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.530 
have noticed is that it's only good
right<00:03:31.400> after<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:31.849> take<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.389> oven

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
right after you take it out of the oven

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.870 
right after you take it out of the oven
and<00:03:32.930> maybe<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.410> sits<00:03:33.620> for<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.829> little<00:03:34.099> while<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and maybe it sits for a little while it

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.030 
and maybe it sits for a little while it
becomes<00:03:35.150> hard<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.139> I<00:03:36.169> wonder<00:03:36.410> if<00:03:36.440> I'm<00:03:36.799> using

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
becomes hard so I wonder if I'm using

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.520 
becomes hard so I wonder if I'm using
bread<00:03:37.400> flour<00:03:37.609> will<00:03:37.849> help<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.780> again<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.109> used

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
bread flour will help but again I used

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.770 
bread flour will help but again I used
all-purpose<00:03:39.980> flour<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:41.269> seems<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.630> work

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
all-purpose flour and it seems to work

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.699 
all-purpose flour and it seems to work
pretty<00:03:42.139> good<00:03:42.709> as<00:03:42.859> well<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.510> go<00:03:44.780> ahead<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.410> put

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
pretty good as well so go ahead and put

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.520 
pretty good as well so go ahead and put
the<00:03:46.280> paddle<00:03:46.760> attachment<00:03:46.959> I'm<00:03:47.959> sorry<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.380> be<00:03:48.500> a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
the paddle attachment I'm sorry to be a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.990 
the paddle attachment I'm sorry to be a
delicate<00:03:49.220> ashmac<00:03:49.549> on<00:03:49.760> here<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:52.280> recipe

delicate ashmac on here and the recipe

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.809 
delicate ashmac on here and the recipe
says<00:03:53.540> not<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:54.139> if<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.380> use<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> stand<00:03:54.950> mixer<00:03:55.069> not

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
says not to if you use a stand mixer not

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.440 
says not to if you use a stand mixer not
to<00:03:56.060> go<00:03:56.239> over<00:03:56.950> setting<00:03:57.950> number<00:03:58.099> two<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.120> I'm

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
to go over setting number two so I'm

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.110 
to go over setting number two so I'm
going<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.870> set<00:04:00.109> it<00:04:00.200> on<00:04:00.319> two<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.190> start<00:04:01.669> adding

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
going to set it on two and start adding

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:15.990 
going to set it on two and start adding
in<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.780> flour<00:04:03.230> little<00:04:03.980> bit<00:04:04.129> at<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.370> time

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.490 

okay<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.269> recipe<00:04:17.419> says<00:04:17.840> once<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.259> gets<00:04:18.410> to

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
okay so the recipe says once it gets to

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.900 
okay so the recipe says once it gets to
this<00:04:18.739> stage<00:04:18.799> where<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.430> starts<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.669> pull<00:04:19.880> away

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
this stage where it starts to pull away

slits<00:06:42.229> like<00:06:42.409> that<00:06:42.619> as<00:06:42.769> you<00:06:42.889> can<00:06:43.039> see<00:06:44.859> so<00:06:45.859> this

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
slits like that as you can see so this

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.109 
slits like that as you can see so this
is<00:06:46.069> the<00:06:46.159> part<00:06:46.339> where<00:06:46.429> it<00:06:46.459> starts<00:06:46.699> to<00:06:46.729> kind<00:06:46.999> of

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:47.119 
is the part where it starts to kind of

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:49.089 
is the part where it starts to kind of
get<00:06:47.239> a<00:06:47.269> little<00:06:47.449> messy<00:06:47.989> but<00:06:48.409> you<00:06:48.469> know<00:06:48.709> what<00:06:48.889> it

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
get a little messy but you know what it

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.859 
get a little messy but you know what it
is<00:06:49.249> all<00:06:49.549> worth<00:06:49.759> it<00:06:49.969> trust<00:06:50.299> me<00:06:52.209> it<00:06:53.209> is<00:06:53.389> important

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:53.869 
is all worth it trust me it is important

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:56.019 
is all worth it trust me it is important
to<00:06:53.929> get<00:06:54.199> every<00:06:54.559> little<00:06:54.859> slit<00:06:55.189> because<00:06:55.579> it<00:06:55.759> kind

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
to get every little slit because it kind

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.709 
to get every little slit because it kind
of<00:06:56.059> bleeds<00:06:56.299> into<00:06:56.869> that<00:06:57.049> bread<00:06:57.489> so<00:06:58.569> just<00:06:59.569> take

00:06:59.709 --> 00:06:59.719 
of bleeds into that bread so just take

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.219 
of bleeds into that bread so just take
your<00:06:59.749> time<00:07:00.019> doing<00:07:00.349> it<00:07:00.619> and<00:07:01.869> then<00:07:02.869> the<00:07:02.989> next

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:03.229 
your time doing it and then the next

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.139 
your time doing it and then the next
thing<00:07:03.319> you'll<00:07:03.529> do<00:07:03.769> as<00:07:04.189> you<00:07:04.609> can<00:07:04.759> see<00:07:04.999> I've

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:05.149 
thing you'll do as you can see I've

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:07.059 
thing you'll do as you can see I've
already<00:07:05.239> pre-cut<00:07:05.929> all<00:07:06.199> of<00:07:06.469> my<00:07:06.619> little<00:07:06.889> pieces

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:07.069 
already pre-cut all of my little pieces

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.099 
already pre-cut all of my little pieces
of<00:07:07.219> cheese<00:07:07.609> and<00:07:08.029> it's<00:07:08.359> just<00:07:08.539> as<00:07:08.659> simple<00:07:08.779> as

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:09.109 
of cheese and it's just as simple as

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:17.919 
of cheese and it's just as simple as
just<00:07:09.229> putting<00:07:09.829> them<00:07:10.039> in<00:07:11.469> side<00:07:12.469> the<00:07:12.649> slits<00:07:16.929> ok

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:17.929 
just putting them in side the slits ok

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:19.209 
just putting them in side the slits ok
so<00:07:17.989> I'm<00:07:18.229> just<00:07:18.379> going<00:07:18.529> to<00:07:18.589> put<00:07:18.709> this<00:07:18.829> back<00:07:19.039> in

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:19.219 
so I'm just going to put this back in

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.749 
so I'm just going to put this back in
the<00:07:19.309> oven<00:07:19.519> for<00:07:19.929> probably<00:07:21.219> no<00:07:22.219> more<00:07:22.249> than<00:07:22.429> five

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
the oven for probably no more than five

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.219 
the oven for probably no more than five
minutes<00:07:22.789> just<00:07:23.360> long<00:07:24.019> enough<00:07:24.110> for<00:07:24.919> the<00:07:25.119> cheese

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229 
minutes just long enough for the cheese

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.159 
minutes just long enough for the cheese
to<00:07:27.229> melt<00:07:27.499> and<00:07:28.099> then<00:07:28.939> I'll<00:07:29.449> take<00:07:29.749> it<00:07:29.779> back<00:07:29.959> out

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
to melt and then I'll take it back out

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.350 
to melt and then I'll take it back out
and<00:07:30.229> then<00:07:30.649> I'll<00:07:30.769> do<00:07:30.979> one<00:07:31.309> more<00:07:31.339> final<00:07:31.909> coat<00:07:32.179> of

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 
and then I'll do one more final coat of

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.809 
and then I'll do one more final coat of
the<00:07:32.509> butter<00:07:32.949> and<00:07:33.949> then<00:07:34.279> we'll<00:07:34.429> be<00:07:34.519> ready<00:07:34.789> to

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:34.819 
the butter and then we'll be ready to

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.679 
the butter and then we'll be ready to
eat<00:07:34.909> it<00:07:36.849> ok<00:07:37.849> so<00:07:37.909> I<00:07:38.059> just<00:07:38.239> pulled<00:07:38.360> it<00:07:38.419> out<00:07:38.509> of<00:07:38.629> the

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:38.689 
eat it ok so I just pulled it out of the

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:40.839 
eat it ok so I just pulled it out of the
oven<00:07:38.929> and<00:07:39.169> you<00:07:40.009> can<00:07:40.159> leave<00:07:40.309> it<00:07:40.459> in<00:07:40.549> a<00:07:40.639> little

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849 
oven and you can leave it in a little

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.039 
oven and you can leave it in a little
bit<00:07:40.939> longer<00:07:41.119> if<00:07:41.389> you<00:07:41.419> want<00:07:41.509> it<00:07:41.719> to<00:07:41.809> brown<00:07:41.989> a

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:42.049 
bit longer if you want it to brown a

00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:43.719 
bit longer if you want it to brown a
little<00:07:42.319> bit<00:07:42.409> more<00:07:42.559> on<00:07:42.679> top<00:07:42.889> but<00:07:43.429> I<00:07:43.459> kind<00:07:43.699> of

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729 
little bit more on top but I kind of

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.009 
little bit more on top but I kind of
like<00:07:43.879> it<00:07:43.909> like<00:07:44.059> this<00:07:44.359> because<00:07:44.659> it's<00:07:44.839> really

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:45.019 
like it like this because it's really

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:47.349 
like it like this because it's really
soft<00:07:45.439> on<00:07:45.649> the<00:07:45.769> inside<00:07:45.799> and<00:07:46.399> not<00:07:46.939> too<00:07:47.119> crunchy

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:47.359 
soft on the inside and not too crunchy

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:49.209 
soft on the inside and not too crunchy
on<00:07:47.599> the<00:07:47.689> outside<00:07:47.749> which<00:07:48.649> again<00:07:48.859> is<00:07:49.009> where<00:07:49.159> I

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:49.219 
on the outside which again is where I

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.299 
on the outside which again is where I
probably<00:07:49.429> need<00:07:49.759> to<00:07:49.849> try<00:07:50.029> actually<00:07:50.299> using

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:51.309 
probably need to try actually using

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:54.009 
probably need to try actually using
bread<00:07:52.309> flour<00:07:52.699> for<00:07:53.059> this<00:07:53.179> particular<00:07:53.599> recipe<00:07:53.749> I

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:54.019 
bread flour for this particular recipe I

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:56.469 
bread flour for this particular recipe I
bet<00:07:54.229> it<00:07:54.319> does<00:07:54.469> make<00:07:54.649> a<00:07:54.739> difference<00:07:54.769> but<00:07:55.729> just

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 
bet it does make a difference but just

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.239 
bet it does make a difference but just
let<00:07:56.629> me<00:07:56.749> know<00:07:56.929> if<00:07:57.169> you<00:07:57.319> try<00:07:57.349> it<00:07:57.799> and<00:07:57.979> if<00:07:58.129> you
