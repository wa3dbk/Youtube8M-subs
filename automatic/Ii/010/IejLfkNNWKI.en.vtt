measuring<00:02:13.390> cup<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.080> use<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.500> instead

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.540 

now<00:02:19.060> add<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.600> milk<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.350> saucepan<00:02:20.590> check

now add the milk to the saucepan check
the<00:02:21.700> heat<00:02:21.910> by<00:02:22.150> dipping<00:02:22.360> one<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.780> your<00:02:22.900> fingers

the heat by dipping one of your fingers

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
the heat by dipping one of your fingers
into<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.530> mixture<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.460> temperature<00:02:24.940> should

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
into the mixture the temperature should

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.900 
into the mixture the temperature should
be<00:02:25.470> 37<00:02:26.470> degrees<00:02:26.860> centigrade<00:02:27.040> which<00:02:27.580> is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
be 37 degrees centigrade which is

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.700 
be 37 degrees centigrade which is
roughly<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.300> same<00:02:28.570> as<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.810> body<00:02:29.080> temperature

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
roughly the same as a body temperature

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.670 
roughly the same as a body temperature
this<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.700> important<00:02:31.240> since<00:02:31.780> if<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.170> too<00:02:32.380> hot

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
this is important since if it is too hot

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.650 
this is important since if it is too hot
it<00:02:33.190> would<00:02:33.310> kill<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.610> yeast<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> dough

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
it would kill the yeast and the dough

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.320 
it would kill the yeast and the dough
will<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:35.050> rise<00:02:35.410> add<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.790> mixture<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.300> the
