real person and that it had created him
so<00:01:45.659> he<00:01:45.810> wouldn't<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.409> lonely<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so he wouldn't be so lonely it was a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
so he wouldn't be so lonely it was a
ridiculous<00:01:48.180> notion<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> context<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
ridiculous notion in the context of the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460 
ridiculous notion in the context of the
show<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.670> became<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.810> time

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
show and it became really the only time

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.550 
show and it became really the only time
that<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:53.009> ever<00:01:53.040> doubted<00:01:53.759> ed<00:01:54.149> Al's<00:01:54.560> unrelenting

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that I ever doubted ed Al's unrelenting

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
that I ever doubted ed Al's unrelenting
faith<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.310> his<00:01:56.610> older<00:01:56.909> brother<00:01:57.149> became<00:01:57.420> an

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
faith in his older brother became an

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.469 
faith in his older brother became an
integral<00:01:58.320> piece<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:59.009> his<00:01:59.479> individual

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
integral piece of his individual

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
integral piece of his individual
character<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.229> thought<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> entire<00:02:01.649> episode

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
character I thought the entire episode

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
character I thought the entire episode
was<00:02:02.430> an<00:02:02.549> unnecessary<00:02:03.140> segue<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
was an unnecessary segue and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
was an unnecessary segue and
contradicted<00:02:05.100> everything<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.549> had<00:02:05.640> seen<00:02:05.909> from

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
contradicted everything we had seen from

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.420 
contradicted everything we had seen from
Al<00:02:06.450> previously

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
Al previously

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.160 
Al previously
and<00:02:07.550> everything<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:08.150> were<00:02:08.210> going<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.660> see<00:02:08.840> from

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and everything we were going to see from

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.590 
and everything we were going to see from
him<00:02:09.290> in<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.470> future<00:02:09.890> still<00:02:10.400> it<00:02:10.850> happened<00:02:11.390> I

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
him in the future still it happened I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720 
him in the future still it happened I
think<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.170> even<00:02:12.590> though<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.890> didn't<00:02:13.250> really

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
think that even though it didn't really

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.910 
think that even though it didn't really
make<00:02:13.880> sense<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.510> was<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> only<00:02:14.960> time<00:02:15.080> we<00:02:15.320> saw<00:02:15.740> a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
make sense it was the only time we saw a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520 
make sense it was the only time we saw a
flaw<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.790> Al<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.450> by<00:02:17.660> flaw<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.170> mean<00:02:18.500> a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
flaw in Al and by flaw I mean a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.050 
flaw in Al and by flaw I mean a
character<00:02:19.190> trait<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.550> would<00:02:19.670> make<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> more

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
character trait that would make it more

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.550 
character trait that would make it more
difficult<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.660> him<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.810> accomplish<00:02:21.350> their

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
difficult for him to accomplish their

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.970 
difficult for him to accomplish their
goal<00:02:21.710> well<00:02:22.100> Al<00:02:22.370> was<00:02:22.760> being<00:02:23.090> his<00:02:23.480> usual<00:02:23.980> perfect

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
goal well Al was being his usual perfect

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.240 
goal well Al was being his usual perfect
flawless<00:02:25.670> self<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.690> was<00:02:27.140> kind<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.410> reminded<00:02:28.040> of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
flawless self I was kind of reminded of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.400 
flawless self I was kind of reminded of

Lou seaman a from A Tale of Two Cities

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.600 
Lou seaman a from A Tale of Two Cities
so<00:02:31.130> perfect<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.210> angelic<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.830> just

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
so perfect and angelic that I just

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.090 
so perfect and angelic that I just
wanted<00:02:35.060> her<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.630> fail<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.770> course<00:02:37.010> she

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
wanted her to fail but of course she

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.550 
wanted her to fail but of course she
never<00:02:37.220> did<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:37.880> al<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.330> kind<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.170> way

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
never did and al is kind of this way

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.710 
never did and al is kind of this way
which<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> why<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.370> think<00:02:40.880> we<00:02:41.060> got<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.390> failure

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
which is why I think we got this failure

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.500 
which is why I think we got this failure
early<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.220> every<00:02:43.610> time<00:02:43.820> we<00:02:43.970> saw<00:02:44.210> him

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
early on so that every time we saw him

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.870 
early on so that every time we saw him
we<00:02:44.840> could<00:02:45.020> look<00:02:45.170> back<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.740> yeah<00:02:46.610> he

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
we could look back and be like yeah he

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.370 
we could look back and be like yeah he
wasn't<00:02:47.090> he<00:02:47.270> did<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.540> stupid<00:02:48.020> thing<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> little

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
wasn't he did that stupid thing a little

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.610 
wasn't he did that stupid thing a little
while<00:02:48.710> ago<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.280> liked<00:02:49.790> how<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:50.960> think<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
while ago I liked how but I think it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.980 
while ago I liked how but I think it
could<00:02:51.830> have<00:02:51.950> been<00:02:51.980> better<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:52.580> he<00:02:52.730> wasn't<00:02:53.210> so

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
could have been better if he wasn't so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.470 
could have been better if he wasn't so
perfect<00:02:54.400> anyway<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:55.700> all<00:02:55.880> if<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.240> have

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
perfect anyway that's all if you have

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600 
perfect anyway that's all if you have
someone<00:02:56.960> else<00:02:57.200> or<00:02:57.530> something<00:02:58.070> else<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.460> want

someone else or something else you want

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.460 
someone else or something else you want
me<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.880> look<00:02:59.030> at<00:02:59.240> then<00:02:59.540> let<00:02:59.780> me<00:02:59.870> know<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.350> I'll
