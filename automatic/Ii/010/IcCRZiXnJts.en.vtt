go<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> UM<00:02:52.049> figure<00:02:54.410> okay<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:55.860> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
go with the UM figure okay so here you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.400 
go with the UM figure okay so here you
can<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.640> took<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.299> bubble<00:02:57.570> off<00:02:57.750> and<00:03:00.410> you

can see that the actually hovercraft
things<00:03:03.360> right<00:03:03.540> here<00:03:03.570> actually<00:03:04.470> move<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.459> you

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
things right here actually move if you

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.500 
things right here actually move if you
blowing<00:03:05.910> I'm<00:03:06.000> enough<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.060> can't<00:03:12.329> see<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
blowing I'm enough and I can't see a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.199 
blowing I'm enough and I can't see a
patty<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:12.959> anyways<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> spin<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.940> blow<00:03:15.150> it

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
patty out anyways a spin if you blow it

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.670 
patty out anyways a spin if you blow it
on<00:03:15.329> they<00:03:15.480> spin<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.440> take<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.120> anyways

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
on they spin so there take that anyways

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.539 
on they spin so there take that anyways
here's<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.799> shell<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:21.810> guy<00:03:22.049> out<00:03:23.870> m<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.920> the

here's the shell this guy out m and the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:34.370 
here's the shell this guy out m and the
figure<00:03:26.910> right<00:03:27.090> here<00:03:32.750> here's<00:03:33.750> actually<00:03:33.930> very

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
figure right here here's actually very

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.300 
figure right here here's actually very
very<00:03:34.620> small<00:03:35.120> compared<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> most<00:03:36.420> Pretender

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
very small compared to most Pretender

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.160 
very small compared to most Pretender
and<00:03:38.640> here's<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.650> vehicle<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:42.510> let's<00:03:42.780> get

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
and here's the vehicle up and let's get

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.460 
and here's the vehicle up and let's get
this<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.739> way<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.170> here's

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
this all out of the way so here's

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.780 
this all out of the way so here's
skyhammer<00:03:47.190> three<00:03:47.580> components<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.410> robot<00:03:49.830> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
skyhammer three components the robot the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.220 
skyhammer three components the robot the
shell<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.420> put<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.080> visor<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.700> vehicle

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
shell I put the visor on and the vehicle

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.870 
shell I put the visor on and the vehicle

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
first we'll just do the robot which is

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.460 
first we'll just do the robot which is
very<00:03:57.180> very<00:03:57.360> easy<00:03:57.540> i<00:03:57.660> mean<00:03:57.930> all<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.230> do<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.440> just

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
very very easy i mean all you do is just

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.509 
very very easy i mean all you do is just
take<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.860> little<00:03:59.069> wing<00:03:59.220> thing<00:04:01.220> put<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
take out the little wing thing put the

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.520 
take out the little wing thing put the
toes<00:04:02.760> down<00:04:04.160> flip<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.340> back<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:07.080> that's

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
toes down flip that back and that's

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.400 
toes down flip that back and that's
pretty<00:04:07.800> much<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.040> pretty<00:04:08.670> easy<00:04:09.410> doesn't

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
pretty much it pretty easy doesn't

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.960 
pretty much it pretty easy doesn't
really<00:04:10.560> roll<00:04:10.799> very<00:04:11.069> well<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:12.170> that's<00:04:13.170> him<00:04:13.970> and

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
really roll very well but that's him and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.840 
really roll very well but that's him and
we'll<00:04:15.090> take<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.600> Pretender<00:04:15.989> she'll<00:04:16.850> just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
we'll take the Pretender she'll just

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.039 
we'll take the Pretender she'll just
flip<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.389> toes<00:04:18.650> kind<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.709> pinch<00:04:19.950> him<00:04:20.130> actually

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
flip the toes kind of pinch him actually

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.280 
flip the toes kind of pinch him actually
like<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:24.139> push<00:04:25.139> those<00:04:25.350> legs<00:04:25.680> up<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:28.020> got

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
like that push those legs up and you got

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.890 
like that push those legs up and you got
the<00:04:28.590> jet<00:04:28.800> mode<00:04:29.040> well<00:04:29.760> if<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.300> put<00:04:30.450> around<00:04:30.690> this

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
the jet mode well if you put around this

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.080 
the jet mode well if you put around this
way<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:32.100> actually<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.669> real<00:04:32.850> adrenaline

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
way that's actually the real adrenaline

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.500 
way that's actually the real adrenaline
right<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:37.050> robot<00:04:37.410> can<00:04:37.620> fit<00:04:37.889> inside

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
right there and the robot can fit inside

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.900 
right there and the robot can fit inside
is<00:04:39.800> jet<00:04:41.180> actually<00:04:43.070> it's<00:04:44.070> tough<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.640> get<00:04:44.729> money

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
is jet actually it's tough to get money

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.719 
is jet actually it's tough to get money
but<00:04:45.120> see<00:04:45.270> he<00:04:45.419> fits<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.310> ride

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
but see he fits in that so you can ride

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.719 
but see he fits in that so you can ride
that<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.330> you'd<00:04:48.450> have<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.630> key<00:04:48.930> vehicle<00:04:49.729> right

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
that so you'd have a key vehicle right

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.760 
that so you'd have a key vehicle right
here<00:04:56.300> ok<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:57.360> now<00:04:57.630> we're<00:04:57.780> going<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.930> put<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
here ok so now we're going to put the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.310 
here ok so now we're going to put the
Pretender<00:04:59.160> shell<00:04:59.370> into<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.840> main<00:05:01.050> vehicle

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
Pretender shell into the main vehicle

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.120 
Pretender shell into the main vehicle
right<00:05:01.740> here<00:05:02.030> jet<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.500> just<00:05:04.680> open<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.010> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
right here jet so you just open up the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.879 
right here jet so you just open up the
jet<00:05:05.340> right<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.789> here's<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.960> shell<00:05:07.289> I<00:05:07.590> open

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
jet right that here's the shell I open

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.490 
jet right that here's the shell I open
up<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.010> back<00:05:08.310> right<00:05:08.520> here<00:05:08.900> fit<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.050> figure<00:05:10.350> in

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
up the back right here fit the figure in

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.690 
up the back right here fit the figure in
the<00:05:10.530> robot<00:05:11.240> fits<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:12.389> there<00:05:12.479> just<00:05:12.600> like<00:05:12.780> that

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
the robot fits in there just like that

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.219 
the robot fits in there just like that
close<00:05:14.700> that<00:05:14.729> close<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:17.539> ship<00:05:18.539> those<00:05:18.780> up<00:05:19.020> I

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
close that close that ship those up I

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.500 
close that close that ship those up I
think<00:05:19.560> he<00:05:19.680> goes<00:05:20.810> like<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:22.789> they're<00:05:23.789> say<00:05:24.150> it's

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
think he goes like this they're say it's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.719 
think he goes like this they're say it's
perfect<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:25.139> like<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.400> have<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.580> put

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
perfect just like that you have to put

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.620 
perfect just like that you have to put
the<00:05:26.760> wings<00:05:26.970> back<00:05:27.270> like<00:05:27.510> that

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.180 

close<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.020> then<00:05:33.290> that's<00:05:33.470> that<00:05:33.590> now

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
close that and then that's that now

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.000 
close that and then that's that now
there's<00:05:34.520> two<00:05:35.330> robots<00:05:35.720> inside<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.140> vehicle

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.280 

here's<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.280> bottom<00:05:40.520> view<00:05:40.880> all<00:05:41.210> gold<00:05:41.600> once

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
here's the bottom view all gold once

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.130 
here's the bottom view all gold once
again<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.710> um<00:05:43.120> gold<00:05:44.120> plastic<00:05:44.510> is<00:05:44.930> just

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
again that um gold plastic is just

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.990 
again that um gold plastic is just
complete<00:05:45.470> garbage<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:46.070> broke<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:46.520> breaks<00:05:46.760> I

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
complete garbage it broke it breaks I

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.940 
complete garbage it broke it breaks I
mean<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.210> broke<00:05:47.420> this<00:05:47.570> thing<00:05:47.870> first<00:05:48.680> time<00:05:48.860> I

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
mean I broke this thing first time I

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.110 
mean I broke this thing first time I
transformed<00:05:49.520> it<00:05:49.580> when<00:05:49.670> I<00:05:49.730> took<00:05:49.790> it<00:05:49.970> out<00:05:50.030> the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
transformed it when I took it out the

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.080 
transformed it when I took it out the
bubble<00:05:50.450> right<00:05:50.930> there<00:05:51.170> there's<00:05:51.350> a<00:05:51.410> huge<00:05:52.090> chunk

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
bubble right there there's a huge chunk

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.110 
bubble right there there's a huge chunk
missing<00:05:53.360> but<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:54.080> okay<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.980> these<00:05:55.820> guns

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
missing but it's okay and these guns

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.700 
missing but it's okay and these guns
also<00:05:56.660> move<00:05:56.840> around<00:05:58.570> like<00:05:59.570> that<00:05:59.840> these<00:06:00.530> things

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
also move around like that these things

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.590 
also move around like that these things
spin<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:03.050> rotors<00:06:03.440> are<00:06:03.590> here<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:05.270> then<00:06:05.420> also

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
spin the rotors are here and then also

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.040 
spin the rotors are here and then also
the<00:06:05.900> wing<00:06:06.110> laser<00:06:06.410> goes<00:06:06.950> right<00:06:07.250> on<00:06:07.370> top<00:06:08.050> like

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
the wing laser goes right on top like

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.930 
the wing laser goes right on top like
that<00:06:09.080> so<00:06:10.420> that's<00:06:11.420> a<00:06:11.570> star<00:06:11.870> hammer<00:06:15.940> another

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
that so that's a star hammer another

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.380 
that so that's a star hammer another
thing<00:06:17.120> I<00:06:17.210> noticed<00:06:17.570> on<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.560> box<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:20.150> look<00:06:20.300> on

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
thing I noticed on the box you look on

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.030 
thing I noticed on the box you look on
the<00:06:20.480> box<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:21.500> compare<00:06:21.980> the<00:06:22.100> colors<00:06:24.040> notice

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
the box and compare the colors notice

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.800 
the box and compare the colors notice
the<00:06:25.160> difference<00:06:25.460> in<00:06:25.580> colors<00:06:25.910> this<00:06:26.420> is<00:06:26.480> like<00:06:26.720> an

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
the difference in colors this is like an

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.050 
the difference in colors this is like an
early<00:06:27.110> version<00:06:27.320> of<00:06:27.650> him<00:06:27.830> he's<00:06:28.520> got<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:28.820> red

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
early version of him he's got the red

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.970 
early version of him he's got the red
and<00:06:29.930> on<00:06:31.240> soit's<00:06:32.240> blue<00:06:32.620> probably<00:06:33.620> an<00:06:33.710> early

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
and on soit's blue probably an early

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.830 
and on soit's blue probably an early
maybe<00:06:34.490> probably<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:34.910> prototype<00:06:35.330> that<00:06:35.360> took<00:06:35.720> the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
maybe probably a prototype that took the

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.140 
maybe probably a prototype that took the
picture<00:06:36.170> with<00:06:36.200> or<00:06:36.530> something<00:06:36.890> but<00:06:37.100> you<00:06:38.000> can

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
picture with or something but you can

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.660 
picture with or something but you can
notice<00:06:38.300> very<00:06:38.630> many<00:06:39.190> lots<00:06:40.190> of<00:06:40.370> different

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
notice very many lots of different

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.230 
notice very many lots of different
differences<00:06:41.150> look<00:06:41.960> at<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.140> blades<00:06:42.410> are<00:06:42.650> blue

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
differences look at the blades are blue

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.770 
differences look at the blades are blue
they're<00:06:44.240> grey<00:06:44.450> right<00:06:44.660> there<00:06:45.760> so<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:47.270> is<00:06:47.480> sky

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
they're grey right there so that is sky
