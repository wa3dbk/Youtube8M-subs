here<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> hydraulic<00:02:48.870> truck

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
here this is a hydraulic truck

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.290 
here this is a hydraulic truck
hydraulic<00:02:50.700> brakes<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.640> does<00:02:53.820> have<00:02:54.060> higher

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
hydraulic brakes and it does have higher

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.540 
hydraulic brakes and it does have higher
I<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.290> air<00:02:55.530> over<00:02:55.830> hydraulic<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.490> I'm

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
I think it's air over hydraulic but I'm

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.840 
I think it's air over hydraulic but I'm
not<00:02:56.670> positive<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.670> maybe<00:02:59.670> it's

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
not positive about that maybe it's

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.880 
not positive about that maybe it's
hydraulic<00:03:00.180> that's<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.750> boost<00:03:03.709> looks<00:03:04.709> like

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
hydraulic that's this boost looks like

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.690 
hydraulic that's this boost looks like
it's<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.190> 5-speed<00:03:05.880> with<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.300> splitter<00:03:06.900> right<00:03:07.700> on

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it's a 5-speed with a splitter right on

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.420 
it's a 5-speed with a splitter right on
the<00:03:08.850> rear<00:03:09.030> end<00:03:09.739> here's<00:03:10.739> how<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:10.950> control

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430

the<00:04:01.570> side<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.200> looks<00:04:02.890> like<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.250> took<00:04:03.280> paint

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.420 

we<00:04:10.270> might<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:10.810> very<00:04:11.379> little<00:04:11.680> dirt<00:04:12.129> right

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
a little idea of the condition of this

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.090 
a little idea of the condition of this
truck<00:05:14.300> thank<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.420> for<00:05:15.570> your<00:05:15.690> time

truck thank you for your time
I<00:05:17.130> actually<00:05:17.790> right<00:05:18.120> here<00:05:18.300> on<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.450> bed<00:05:18.630> I'll

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
I actually right here on the bed I'll

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.760 
I actually right here on the bed I'll
show<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:19.200> this<00:05:19.440> does<00:05:20.370> have<00:05:20.610> a<00:05:20.670> little<00:05:20.880> bit<00:05:21.060> of

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
show you this does have a little bit of

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.090 
show you this does have a little bit of
rust<00:05:22.770> here<00:05:23.450> maybe<00:05:24.620> looks<00:05:25.620> like<00:05:25.800> pretty<00:05:26.010> much

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
rust here maybe looks like pretty much

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.370 
rust here maybe looks like pretty much
all<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> way<00:05:26.550> across<00:05:26.730> here<00:05:27.660> I'd<00:05:27.870> probably<00:05:28.110> put

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
all the way across here I'd probably put

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.700 
all the way across here I'd probably put
me<00:05:28.590> maybe<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:29.270> eight<00:05:30.270> inch<00:05:30.540> band<00:05:30.960> from<00:05:31.320> one<00:05:31.470> side

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
me maybe a eight inch band from one side

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.460 
me maybe a eight inch band from one side
to<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:31.950> other<00:05:32.510> it's<00:05:33.510> just<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.870> outer<00:05:34.020> liner

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
to the other it's just the outer liner

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.380 
to the other it's just the outer liner
the<00:05:35.160> inner<00:05:35.280> look<00:05:35.820> good

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
the inner look good

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.350 
the inner look good
the<00:05:36.960> last<00:05:37.170> time<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.410> looked<00:05:37.620> at<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.490> probably

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
the last time I looked at it so probably

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.970 
the last time I looked at it so probably
just<00:05:39.420> puts<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.840> piece<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.020> 1/8<00:05:40.440> plate<00:05:40.770> from

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
just puts you a piece of 1/8 plate from

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.220 
just puts you a piece of 1/8 plate from
one<00:05:41.160> side<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.610> other<00:05:41.760> eight<00:05:42.090> inches<00:05:42.450> tile

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
one side to the other eight inches tile

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.960 
one side to the other eight inches tile
and<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.770> believe<00:05:44.010> you'd<00:05:44.130> be<00:05:44.190> good<00:05:44.520> there<00:05:44.730> for<00:05:44.760> a

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
and I believe you'd be good there for a

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.300 
and I believe you'd be good there for a
long<00:05:45.120> time<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.690> it's<00:05:46.290> me<00:05:46.710> that's<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.100> most

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
long time but it's me that's the most
