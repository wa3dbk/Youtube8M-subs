00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
most of them you can see there soon I am

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.710 
most of them you can see there soon I am
a<00:01:24.590> transmitter<00:01:26.060> most<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:28.770> course<00:01:29.720> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
a transmitter most of them of course and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.310 
a transmitter most of them of course and
they<00:01:30.869> require<00:01:31.939> milly<00:01:32.939> milly<00:01:34.430> media<00:01:35.430> player<00:01:36.320> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320

they require milly milly media player so
you<00:01:37.380> can't<00:01:38.240> use<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.540> how<00:01:40.380> maybe<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.009> use

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you can't use them how maybe if you use

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.230 
you can't use them how maybe if you use
for<00:01:41.850> example<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:44.240> may<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.299> able<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.409> them

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
for example I may be able to use them

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
for example I may be able to use them
but<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.659> otherwise<00:01:51.960> as

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but I don't have one but otherwise as

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.030 
but I don't have one but otherwise as
you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:58.040> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you can see you you just take you you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.569 
you can see you you just take you you
have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> key<00:01:59.490> body<00:01:59.729> everything<00:02:00.659> works<00:02:01.579> except

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
have a key body everything works except

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.010 
have a key body everything works except
maybe<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.590> IC<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.659> have<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> see

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
maybe the IC just like to have you see

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.039 
maybe the IC just like to have you see
them<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.619> little

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
them there's a little

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.410 
them there's a little
to<00:02:11.049> zoom<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:12.430> picture<00:02:13.799> but<00:02:14.799> this<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.180> also

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to zoom in picture but this one also

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
to zoom in picture but this one also
does<00:02:17.019> not<00:02:17.290> seem<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.769> work

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
does not seem to work

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.989 
does not seem to work
why<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.560> keyboard<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.069> free<00:02:21.430> functional

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
why the the keyboard is free functional

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.550 
why the the keyboard is free functional
and<00:02:22.689> of<00:02:22.959> course<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> mouse<00:02:23.560> also<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:26.290> you

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
and of course the mouse also I think you

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.539 
and of course the mouse also I think you
should<00:02:26.859> speak<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.540> no<00:02:29.319> no<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.219> that's

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
should speak and no no that's that's

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.059 
should speak and no no that's that's
interesting<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.680> let's<00:02:33.209> let's<00:02:34.209> switch<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.170> my

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
interesting so let's let's switch to my

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.920 
interesting so let's let's switch to my
computer<00:02:36.639> and<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.719> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.049> see<00:02:38.109> I<00:02:39.269> have<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.299> lot
