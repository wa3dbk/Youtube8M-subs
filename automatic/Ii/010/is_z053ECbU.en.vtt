my<00:02:18.500> heart<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:19.040> realized<00:02:19.550> for<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
my heart because I realized for the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.620 
my heart because I realized for the
first<00:02:20.630> time<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.640> way<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.940> felt<00:02:23.240> when

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
first time that the way that I felt when

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.090
