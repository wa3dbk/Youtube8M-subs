00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello welcome one more day of the channel and 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.150
 good those that follow me and makes a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.280
 you will know that I am not very you have gone to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.350
 talk about makeup or derivatives so 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.560
 very well so much in both I have decided 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 make a favorite of the moment 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.300
 makeup so this is what is a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 makeup favorites 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.750
 the first product that I want to show you 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.230
 it's been like the bag making this video 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:43.920
 since they have charmed me with their price 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.920
 with its qualities and its usefulness 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.809
 and that is the cry of l'oréal what I 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.120
 looking basically was something for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.190
 get into the joy for everyone to get me out 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 the brightness when it goes well had 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 mirror and some little thing to apply the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 colour 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.820
 and Mrs. taught me that I meet 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:17.000
 and it 's perfect for me too that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.000
 exactly this one from where skin is he 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:27.330
 9 with these same parameters of the skin 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.560
 it leaves my skin smooth without shine doubt 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.150
 I go makeup 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.590
 the above object looks good so 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 nothing that is that I'm in love with this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 product the truth and cheap is cheap 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 I think the client was worth nine euros 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.160
 product that I want to show you is the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 naked bàsics that you all know those that 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.990
 the use every day is messenger 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 Dr. Hernández carried out this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 it has a bit of brightness that goes great 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.090
 for this part of the eye the little one is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.030
 useful from the basics this color goes 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.039
 action for tables provide eyebrows in 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.670
 the matte black that is also very good 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.849
 to make an outline with intention and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.489
 It is not a mirror, it is also very good 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.430
 and that everything is going very well and it is very 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.060
 good and very little and that then 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.569
 I really like talking about what was worth 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.370
 this channel everything that is immersion in 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.230
 exactly 6 shades of good quality 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.810
 because you know that they go dyke that we 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.760
 of good quality would not be worth 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.150
 maybe out to 42 more shadows five 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.129
 euros that are very well the third where 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.980
 then I want to talk about is east of 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.640
 maybelline which is the anti-aging eraser 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.660
 to do 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.730
 I do not have exaggerated dark circles but 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.400
 yes it is true that this part of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.550
 old when I get up sometimes is not 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.900
 very clothes with irritated then this one me 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.190
 helps to hide it 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.920
 and other 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.920
 at the hours they are marked they are marked 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.630
 two 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.980
 wrinkles with makeup inside we go but 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.140
 everything to prove the most enduring 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.319
 and that suits me better 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.140
 if you buy a clear tone like this one and 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.440
 you put it here because it illuminates our 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440
 face 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.130
 a lot of makeup 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.730
 the next product started to use 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.720
 again and I used it a lot last year 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.099
 and this is the mascara flood the kate and 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.440
 this is colored 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.500
 107 number that I now 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.670
 put and I've spent luxe a lot because 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.530
 it's creamy it's not dry it 's nobody but with 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.519
 a little bit of shine is not super soler 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.280
 marley 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.280
 the color to mark in pretty colors 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.269
 what happened to me 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:22.139
 the last product is a state 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.009
 it's a 6 week gap of the range 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.719
 something 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:39.139
 I'll leave a link on the page 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:41.800
 information and the truth is that there was 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.339
 used those that are straight above 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.869
 come and this has something like a little 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:54.319
 rounder and I do much better on 

00:04:50.869 --> 00:05:00.469
 everything for what are the gaps of the 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:03.379
 face the plant the distance of the 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:05.839
 sites is super rise in the finish is 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:09.259
 great very little faster to plane areas 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:11.599
 super soft we trappers what 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.279
 typical that girls say on youtube or 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.909
 the brush good because I think that this 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:19.610
 they have it all were also 480 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.219
 exactly and the last thing that I wanted you 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.020
 To teach is a nail polish 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.209
 since it is black 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.849
 I have put one but there is a post and it is 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.420
 this team and in general titans like this 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.580
 I do not love them 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.080
 actually we put ourselves really 250 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.870
 I still look cooler and 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.960
 I'm exactly using black a lot 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.300
 is a better one does not have much else has nor 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.050
 dismissals or videos or anything 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.540
 last they believe so because my dream is 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.600
 pinto and preferably signs and spit 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.980
 the clamp nails the first second day and 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.289
 is the chains so the one who does his 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.099
 function pretty well 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:10.129
 and nothing good because these are my 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:13.580
 makeup favorites of the moment 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:15.709
 we are interested in what he does more than this 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.389
 kind of videos and the next's coat will be 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.999
 surely in a long time already 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.610
 that not only change your strip a lot 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.619
 makeup but good if we use state 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.339
 tell me please because I 'm going to 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:30.740
 repeat and if you did not like it then I would not 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.880
 say nothing 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.690
 I do not know how to say it 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.970
 the arcades and not much more than us 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.670
 we see in the next video a little kiss and 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.800
 until next time if someone told me that 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.030
 I look like a bunny and you write the 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.210
 I do not know how I said goodbye and I say goodbye 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.210
 A) Yes
