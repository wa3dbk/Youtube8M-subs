 very good to all welcome to call of 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.069
 duty advanced warfare remember that in the 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.080
 previous video if you have not seen it 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.080
 I leave it in the description we have seen 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.699
 all the features in the section 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 create a class either main 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.429
 secondary advantages of sex fitness 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.349
 jokers streaks and accessories the truth 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.089
 that we have seen everything in detail and what 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.769
 you have in the description if you have not 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.570
 seen and if you have seen it then 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.039
 prepare because now you have more 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.829
 advanced warfare and in this case we have 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.570
 the code cards we would go to the people who 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.579
 the egg I will make a video also talking 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 of the other details in this case 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.270
 I want to tell you about all the cards 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.399
 with titles like most what 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 they call in this case we have emblems and 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.100
 business cards that for me would be 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.930
 the titles in this case but let's 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.629
 see the emblems quickly before 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.100
 by the way I have to choose me some 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.780
 emblems we have emblem or an emblem 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.420
 two emblem three emblem four five 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.670
 six seven eight nine to ten if not 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.800
 I'm wrong in black ops 2 will be the same and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.809
 how is this going as we have to draw 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.850
 ourselves or good to add the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.680
 drawing we want is type black ops 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.930
 2 could therefore 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.610
 create the type of emblem that gave you 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
 he wins and the truth is that he's pretty 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 well point in favor of this color that the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.840
 bread save and I think people are going 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.820
 to love me personally I love 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.830
 and good as I said point in favor 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.210
 we have days I repeat the truth that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 it's pretty good and I guess more 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 ahead will come some trick of the plan 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.300
 copy emblems and that will be pretty 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.850
 well also or not for likes 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.560
 colors come the emblems you know the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.150
 most how the subject goes so let's move 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.880
 the cards we'll see 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.070
 all all more well said the cards 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.450
 that we have general that we have then 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.729
 general are the ones you can choose 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.800
 whatever the level 0 or level 50 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.960
 level 4 whatever you can choose the ones in 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.020
 this case we have a two three four 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.430
 we have four per column we are going to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.080
 see them the truth that they are a gorgeous 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 They are very cool and it is not the plan 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.740
 rectangular is not a little more square 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.740
 it's a little bigger in square plan 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 rectangular and good they look very cool 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.060
 they are very well edited in created better 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.190
 said and good very cool the truth good 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.630
 let's move on to the operation is here already 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 we will have to start unlocking the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.080
 things many people have complained d 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 they are difficult to unlock but I 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.310
 I think the more difficult the better 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.610
 here I see that a finished one is blocked 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.290
 without mercy wins 25 million gaz 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 Well, it's pretty cool, we have 4 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.420
 by column we also have one two three 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.720
 four five columns plus another where 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.090
 there are only two emblems and well these are 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.340
 the operations in plan to kill not that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.200
 you need to kill let's go to the next one 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.970
 is the modes here is more to capture 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.980
 flags and all that roll completed the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.959
 challenges in this way the game finished 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.700
 with the best score 15 times in this 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.220
 game mode host these are these 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.069
 very cool we have here too 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.980
 four per column are many the truth 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.840
 very cool watson look like miniatures of 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.930
 videos are really cool the truth 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.750
 let's go to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.010
 to the exo section because more of the same 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.189
 in this case relate to the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.769
 exoskeleton gets 200 250 casualties there 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.870
 that put in how much he said with falls with 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.659
 impulse well then we would also have 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.250
 what to kill but using the exoskeleton 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.920
 get 200 casualties with decent desire 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.719
 expal in this case also the set of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.219
 experimentations and added that 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.000
 shocked hours also killed if 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.349
 still good the typical is not good then 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.359
 the truth that it will cost an egg 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.859
 unlock everything in truth that yes that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.569
 it's difficult but I think it 's better 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.669
 while low with this gun shooter with 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.889
 here good good good with this this one 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.569
 unlock as time passes 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.810
 killing and using I do not know if they will give you 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.639
 some title something unlocking all 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.530
 all titles all all 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.109
 cards of each section I think yes no 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.430
 I know we'll see we hope yes accessories 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.139
 more of the same all good in being 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.909
 related beige advantage rachel points 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.879
 everything is related to doing things 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.530
 rather I am teaching you to 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.819
 see more or less how are they are very 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.590
 pimps me up until now I had not seen 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.599
 no video to show it 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.010
 thermal this thermal I have to highlight 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.629
 which is a pretty handsome accessory 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.250
 said in the previous video and it's something 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.140
 different that marks you in plan 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.330
 people in plan and for red no title 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.800
 thermal always up to now 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.500
 pretty cool 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.060
 well get and 500 casualties such 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.549
 with this accessory this accessory 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.870
 advantages here I have one that is blocked 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.490
 light weight that pretty 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.690
 peripheral more of the same good here 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.670
 you have all coolness very cool the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.110
 truth is very cool streak points 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.030
 more of the same to me I would like 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.070
 unlock this the paladin's get 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.400
 nawar bird skis and where is the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.590
 paladin 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.470
 there is not the paladin's here 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.270
 so look for 100 casualties with the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.169
 paladin 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.949
 good, all really cool 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.300
 jokers good here we also have more 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.110
 get 200 casualties with two accessories 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.600
 with your secondary weapon very cool 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.130
 I personally like them all then 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.370
 I'll see who's the one I like 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.430
 more and here we see the elements that I say 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.800
 good if elements titles cards that 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.110
 we unlock with each prestige how many 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.960
 prestigious of 15 reaches masters of 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.120
 good prestige because this is this 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.300
 emblem not this title looks a lot like 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.070
 to the white emblem 2 not when 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.810
 you are maximum prestige it looks a lot like 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.210
 the truth though that was a little blue 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.940
 you have to say blue this is blue the other 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.940
 it was a little red yellow I do not know I do not 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.980
 okay but the way was almost almost 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.600
 equal to a skull without plan of plan 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.880
 of symbol to give me that would be like 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.220
 call it good you know what I 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840
 I mean clans clans look at all the 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.360
 business cards of clans categories 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.760
 Well these are very cool the truth 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.410
 also because when you raise the clan you have to 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.850
 well I have to tell you a detail that 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.370
 if you have a short ding clan and coast 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.200
 here you are also in the same clan as well 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.570
 what good can you unlock from now 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.430
 if you are in if you were in a clan of 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 ghost if you already have the game too 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.000
 you will be in that clan in the same game 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.720
 so well I can unlock 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.640
 you're here we have the dragon we see the 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.920
 Clouds in plan very cool rainbows 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.680
 finally we have the bonus 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.470
 which is the one that comes with the edition 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.110
 of 0 that in other videos or I will explain 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.180
 All the details 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.620
 what comes in the edition of the 0 and in 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.780
 this case I'm going to put myself 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.400
 like this title was also between 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.110
 the typical ones that could unlock it 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.820
 reserving the game if I 'm not wrong and 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.650
 doing some tricks you are not will be 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.960
 patched but well I'm not interested in anything 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.480
 about the tutical color like now 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.100
 We are in advanced warfare flagship me 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.870
 I put top 1 I know I'm not a plan 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.940
 important pro I do not know I like it 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.200
 put the top 11 because I do not know if what 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.810
 you know but I have the challenge I have the series 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.690
 I'm going to start right now 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.180
 I think of reaching the top 1 of domain top 1 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.270
 of the world in ps3 in domain mode so 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.590
 What happens to the channel if you are interested 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.720
 because I'm going to start the series I'm going to go to 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.550
 sack is worth so I do not expect anything 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.920
 I liked the card section 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.140
 scott we have more things that I'll give them 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.610
 teaching later we have here by 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.440
 prestige example good when you want 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.970
 prestige here we have it but good 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.860
 I hope you liked it and you know the 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.900
 enjoyment has gone a lot we'll see 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.900
 in a next video there have been people
