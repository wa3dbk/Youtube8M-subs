losing that lost me a lot of possible

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.809

momentum<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.470> gain<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.370> only<00:02:14.670> other<00:02:14.700> thing

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
momentum to gain the only other thing

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.790 
momentum to gain the only other thing
like<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.569> gonna<00:02:15.660> say<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:15.959> really<00:02:16.560> really

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
like I was gonna say that really really

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.589 
like I was gonna say that really really
really<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.160> could<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.459> done<00:02:17.580> better<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
really I could have done better was if I

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.570 
really I could have done better was if I
had<00:02:18.750> brought<00:02:18.959> my<00:02:19.140> adamant<00:02:19.620> Mamoswine<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.340> had

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
had brought my adamant Mamoswine I had

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
had brought my adamant Mamoswine I had
my<00:02:20.610> adamant<00:02:21.150> Mamoswine<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.019> game

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
my adamant Mamoswine I think the game

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
my adamant Mamoswine I think the game
would<00:02:22.319> have<00:02:22.440> gone<00:02:22.560> entirely<00:02:23.220> different<00:02:23.819> Joe

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
would have gone entirely different Joe

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.460 
would have gone entirely different Joe
would<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.690> been<00:02:24.780> forced<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.080> make<00:02:25.260> plays

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
would have been forced to make plays

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.330 
would have been forced to make plays
that<00:02:25.650> he<00:02:25.709> probably<00:02:25.890> wouldn't<00:02:26.160> been

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
that he probably wouldn't been

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.740 
that he probably wouldn't been
comfortable<00:02:26.700> making<00:02:26.880> because<00:02:27.209> he

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
comfortable making because he

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.740 
comfortable making because he
specifically<00:02:28.349> even<00:02:29.310> his<00:02:29.430> porygon<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.390> live

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
specifically even his porygon to to live

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.180 
specifically even his porygon to to live
from<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.920> jolly<00:02:33.560> Mamoswine<00:02:34.560> holding<00:02:34.830> my<00:02:34.920> form

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
from a jolly Mamoswine holding my form

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.350 
from a jolly Mamoswine holding my form
so<00:02:35.370> had<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> been<00:02:36.000> adamant<00:02:36.510> holding<00:02:36.840> life<00:02:36.959> org

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
so had I been adamant holding life org

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.979 
so had I been adamant holding life org
honestly<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> game<00:02:39.569> would<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.750> been<00:02:39.840> so

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
honestly the game would have been so

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.210 
honestly the game would have been so
much<00:02:40.049> different<00:02:40.440> because<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:41.010> he<00:02:41.069> brought

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
much different because when he brought

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
much different because when he brought
on<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.370> porygon<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.360> turned<00:02:42.569> four

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
on that porygon to I'm like turned four

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660 
on that porygon to I'm like turned four
or<00:02:42.930> five<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.709> would<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:43.950> been<00:02:43.980> over<00:02:44.220> half<00:02:44.519> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
or five it would have been over half and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.740 
or five it would have been over half and
you<00:02:44.730> live<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:44.880> forced<00:02:45.209> switch<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.540> again

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you live in forced switch out again

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.089 
you live in forced switch out again
