00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.570
 I know that until yesterday, we could see 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.570
 in which it is a pity that we then do the calculation 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:11.169
 on here 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.869
 You will link this point here. 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.879
 there in the red 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.199
 in tokyo cities 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.199
 ulisses is that a doorman 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 we did 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 I participate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 since you hamilton won the bahia defeated kelly no 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.069
 also serves to complement a machine will be easy access 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.359
 after all they want you not to hit your own, this beats well here do not be 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.770
 import 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.610
 and has done enough force 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.720
 there is no born force in the section you play with too much force on the angle goes 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.900
 close 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.850
 his passport then I have 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 done that 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.429
 like this 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.500
 but at that moment the wing did not do just a little bit the hand like I do to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.149
 in fact with this posture and another in the sector okay, right? 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.890
 but at the same time I will come here but she hit here 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.860
 she's going to have it a little bit before and she's fucked up with a little big 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 so she'll close the angle and how they know the strength of the party for us to change 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.770
 so the training for you, for example 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.170
 already in a ball up 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 it's tasty and wood 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.850
 only need not unless I wanted to get a ball for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.090
 example here 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.010
 but if you just want to not shake around here you can play gently to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.100
 kiko 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
 I do not usually judge how long it takes us to wear a suit. 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.100
 in competition 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.950
 Look it depends on the player level in england eg roni solitude 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.649
 locked lock from means kill all at home for all balls 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:54.480
 will enter 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.260
 The use of the brand 147 points with 21 balls 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.130
 He made it in 5 minutes. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.460
 five minutes 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.429
 And hey, a ball goes after 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.359
 in caçapava later came back serious latina with this is very fast very 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.410
 fast and month of delay about 15 minutes the boavista 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.249
 where people make more mistakes let's play pool 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.140
 like our environment that is also super chic pf despite the house 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 there is on the table 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.710
 Lies to get hit. 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.580
 at first calling me two years because women play much less 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.429
 time 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.069
 already starts calling 30 years played poorly 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.639
 they failed to raise the risk level he did not go to the game 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.859
 because they have a defect behind postures 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.679
 so priest what most players play here is so foot 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.519
 all over the land as it did with what is at stake, it is of the utmost importance that you 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.709
 put the same to the park 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.180
 and only details of each of the 27 sections 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.269
 and you have to always face the ball to the player 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.980
 white from front to red for the turn ball 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.730
 this business of playing here 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.020
 gardening 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.269
 the worst thing is that they do there juggling space that behind 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.089
 but I still have to sign 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:12.609
 it's true the ir is being that one can already do this is much more lean and part 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.909
 in the foot a degeneration table top in the majority as good steel does not mean 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.059
 that if it's good means you're the nail you're playing this way 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.529
 whenever I spoke 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.430
 there is in the terreiro that the colleague 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.540
 until now I would like to celebrate the date from which it was the most 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.950
 quick and effective look out these cost aids and part presentation at 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.520
 House 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.610
 It costs a joke a game of pool can be a little more attentive 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.789
 not to make these mistakes for the beat 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.179
 in the spot location of the ball 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.049
 it is for example at the time that we applied the effects that the patient the ball 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.779
 oceanic retreat 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.509
 very important you do not 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:56.620
 the person's biggest mistake when applied and lift the snail's tip 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.929
 and lower back musse has to always 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.589
 lift the two as if with the chemical elevator then lift the 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:08.370
 hand and dove health attack on the same screen support the hand 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.280
 with hand support 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.010
 it together with the grip we've already made 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.479
 not reported 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.549
 and there it is very important if you want to play for example 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.989
 Make a course 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.539
 knows has courses overcome those you learn all that you always 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.259
 will have a small defect we wake up at the time take photo 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.930
 and fix it all 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.960
 especially for women have specific groups for women now 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.229
 what I think is cool is that many companies many entrepreneurs 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.680
 in search of the maximum with a reputation of concentration and of so well 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.729
 after dominating the society during the x 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.039
 the most important moments 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.150
 critics né dodik state world passes then champion employee you 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:51.349
 you have to call attention but you have to be centered 70 above 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.560
 everything and so it never does, it actually leads to this after the 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.569
 play your day-to-day life lessa 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.300
 I have done many many lectures for senior executives 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.240
 step 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.400
 and first that they like in which all names glide from the doorman to the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.729
 owner also provides that both can play in error around a 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:11.419
 afternoon time 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.419
 a lady of 60 years we will play with a child of 15 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.689
 the teenager of 15 then is an extremely athletic game can everyone 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:20.639
 to participate 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.770
 in the first executive he likes to play because the game the team so 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.789
 technician 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.210
 that even if of his problems he thinks only of that second in three cells 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.349
 and the same example strategy of this is how to place the exact year at the 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:34.750
 proof 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.930
 everytime 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.620
 punished enjoy this game more than the practitioner 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.419
 now it's good that you have it at home

 would let him always go crooked 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.639
 he has that other apartment 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.240

 portability whether you can take it anywhere 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.059
 It is better than not to make him see himself 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.740
 oh cool how it will get lighter 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.319

 taxi is little difference is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.449

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.240
 to confront like this is not funny 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.250
