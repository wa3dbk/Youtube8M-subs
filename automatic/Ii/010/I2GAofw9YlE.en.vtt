00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it only went so far because there just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
it only went so far because there just
wasn't<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.939> extend

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
wasn't a lot of time to you know extend
the<00:01:57.450> storyline<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the storyline and this time I get to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.410 
the storyline and this time I get to
really<00:02:00.030> divulge<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> character<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
explore that and it was a blast I mean

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.479 
explore that and it was a blast I mean
she<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.729> vulnerable<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.329> she's<00:02:06.540> tough<00:02:07.489> she

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
she is vulnerable but she's tough she

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.589 
she is vulnerable but she's tough she
really<00:02:08.729> wants<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> make<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> difference

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
little more ahead of me on that one

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.110 
little more ahead of me on that one
because<00:02:21.860> at<00:02:21.980> least<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.220> went<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:22.730> did

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
because at least you went you know did

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.020 
because at least you went you know did
some<00:02:23.299> training<00:02:23.540> didn't<00:02:24.170> get<00:02:24.290> caught<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:25.970> I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
some training didn't get caught but I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.369 
some training didn't get caught but I
like<00:02:26.299> that<00:02:26.510> about<00:02:26.720> her<00:02:26.840> because<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.110> really

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
like that about her because I really

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.110 
like that about her because I really
wanted<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> make<00:02:28.340> sure<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.549> that<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.879> in<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
wanted to make sure that that was in the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.839 
wanted to make sure that that was in the
character<00:02:29.569> because<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.640> that's

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
character because I think that's

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.339 
character because I think that's
interesting<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.690> know<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.260> all

anything else it's not a procedural show

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.230 
anything else it's not a procedural show
it's<00:05:03.500> very<00:05:03.710> character-driven<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.759> you've

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
it's very character-driven and you've

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.909 
it's very character-driven and you've
got<00:05:05.449> five<00:05:05.720> rookie<00:05:06.110> cops<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.710> on<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
got five rookie cops that it's on the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.620 
got five rookie cops that it's on the
first<00:05:07.130> day<00:05:07.340> we<00:05:07.940> think<00:05:08.180> we<00:05:08.270> have<00:05:08.389> everything

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
first day we think we have everything

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.180 
first day we think we have everything
figured<00:05:08.960> out<00:05:09.199> we<00:05:09.530> know<00:05:09.620> exactly<00:05:09.860> what's<00:05:10.130> gonna

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
figured out we know exactly what's gonna

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.640 
figured out we know exactly what's gonna
happen<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.699> who<00:05:10.789> we<00:05:10.940> are<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.470> where<00:05:12.470> we<00:05:12.620> want

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
happen and who we are and where we want

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.060 
happen and who we are and where we want
to<00:05:12.919> go<00:05:13.039> with<00:05:13.220> our<00:05:13.250> lives<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.910> in<00:05:14.090> careers<00:05:14.389> and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
to go with our lives and in careers and

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.939 
to go with our lives and in careers and
reality<00:05:16.070> kind<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.370> hits<00:05:16.759> us<00:05:16.880> in<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.030> face<00:05:17.270> and

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
reality kind of hits us in the face and

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.040 
reality kind of hits us in the face and
we<00:05:18.949> all<00:05:19.099> have<00:05:19.280> different<00:05:19.310> journeys<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.030> how<00:05:20.990> we

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
we all have different journeys of how we

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.560 
we all have different journeys of how we
sort<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.650> out<00:05:21.710> but<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.220> think<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.699> I<00:05:23.030> think

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
sort that out but I think it's I think

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.260 
sort that out but I think it's I think
it's<00:05:23.840> really<00:05:24.110> relatable<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.860> think<00:05:25.270> each

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
it's really relatable I think each

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.390 
it's really relatable I think each
character<00:05:26.870> has<00:05:26.900> been<00:05:27.199> well<00:05:27.710> written<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.280> we

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
character has been well written and we

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.040 
character has been well written and we
