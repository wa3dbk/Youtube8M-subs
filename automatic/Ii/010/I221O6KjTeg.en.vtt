00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.679 

okay<00:00:01.890> if<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.550> remember<00:00:02.879> earlier<00:00:03.360> I<00:00:03.449> mentioned

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
okay if you remember earlier I mentioned

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.860 
okay if you remember earlier I mentioned
how<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.100> particular<00:00:05.759> case<00:00:06.450> we're<00:00:06.839> using

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
how in this particular case we're using

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.169 
how in this particular case we're using
the<00:00:07.770> front<00:00:08.700> USB<00:00:09.300> header<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:10.080> our<00:00:10.889> USB<00:00:11.219> 2.0

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the front USB header here our USB 2.0

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.970 
the front USB header here our USB 2.0
and<00:00:13.429> this<00:00:14.429> motherboard<00:00:14.820> comes<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.420> USB<00:00:15.980> 3.0

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
and this motherboard comes with USB 3.0

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.670 
and this motherboard comes with USB 3.0
the<00:00:17.220> main<00:00:17.460> difference<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.650> USB<00:00:19.650> 3.0

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
the main difference is that USB 3.0

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.519 
the main difference is that USB 3.0
plugs<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> blue<00:00:24.600> insert<00:00:25.350> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
plugs are going to have a blue insert in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.509 
plugs are going to have a blue insert in
them<00:00:25.619> that's<00:00:25.800> how<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.130> always<00:00:26.310> tell<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
them that's how you can always tell the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.560 
them that's how you can always tell the
difference<00:00:26.640> black<00:00:27.380> for<00:00:28.380> USB<00:00:28.769> 2.0<00:00:29.310> blue<00:00:29.699> for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
difference black for USB 2.0 blue for

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.950 
difference black for USB 2.0 blue for
3.0<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> USB<00:00:31.340> 3.0<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> lot<00:00:32.640> faster<00:00:33.300> now<00:00:33.480> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
3.0 and USB 3.0 is a lot faster now that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
3.0 and USB 3.0 is a lot faster now that
doesn't<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:34.530> any<00:00:34.710> difference<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.670> if

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
doesn't make any difference really if

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.100 
doesn't make any difference really if
all<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.270> doing<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> listening<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
all you're doing is listening to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
all you're doing is listening to
headphones<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:38.239> using<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> mouse<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
headphones or using a mouse or a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
headphones or using a mouse or a
keyboard<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.469> something<00:00:40.860> either<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
keyboard or something either one of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
keyboard or something either one of
these<00:00:41.760> will<00:00:41.940> work<00:00:41.969> fine<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
these will work fine but if you have a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.970 
these will work fine but if you have a
pendrive<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:45.120> external<00:00:45.629> hard<00:00:46.260> drive<00:00:46.350> that

pendrive or an external hard drive that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459 
pendrive or an external hard drive that
you<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> backup<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.539> transfer<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you want to backup with or transfer a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.580 
you want to backup with or transfer a
lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.829> data<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:50.520> movies<00:00:51.020> USB<00:00:52.020> 3.0<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
lot of data or some movies USB 3.0 is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.020 
lot of data or some movies USB 3.0 is
the<00:00:52.739> way<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> lot

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the way to go it's going to be a lot

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
the way to go it's going to be a lot
faster<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.570> save<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> time<00:00:55.469> now

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
faster and save you a lot of time now

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.150 
faster and save you a lot of time now
since<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.969> any<00:00:57.090> USB<00:00:57.600> 3.0<00:00:58.160> headers

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
since we don't have any USB 3.0 headers

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
since we don't have any USB 3.0 headers
I<00:00:59.510> bought<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.199> twelve<00:01:02.070> bucks

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in here but is is we've found out this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
in here but is is we've found out this
one<00:01:15.330> doesn't<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.350> small<00:01:16.860> size

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
one doesn't have the right small size

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.480 
one doesn't have the right small size
hole<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> dug<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:20.340> my

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
hole for it to go in so I dug through my

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
hole for it to go in so I dug through my
boxes<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> extra<00:01:21.420> parts<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.740> found<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
boxes of extra parts and I found this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
boxes of extra parts and I found this
old<00:01:23.520> zip<00:01:24.509> drive<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.140> looks<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> floppy

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
old zip drive if it looks like a floppy

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
old zip drive if it looks like a floppy
drive<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> fancy<00:01:28.229> floppy<00:01:28.710> drive

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
drive this is a fancy floppy drive

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.910 
drive this is a fancy floppy drive
basically<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.299> capacity<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.590> people

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
basically with more capacity the people

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760 
basically with more capacity the people
used<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.700> oh<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.750> 10<00:01:34.020> years<00:01:34.259> ago<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
used to use oh about 10 years ago and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
used to use oh about 10 years ago and
this<00:01:35.430> comes<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> these<00:01:36.360> brackets<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this comes into one of these brackets so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
this comes into one of these brackets so
I<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.290> took<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
I just took this out and now I have a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
I just took this out and now I have a
bracket<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.070> slide<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.400> into

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
bracket that this will slide right into

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
bracket that this will slide right into
so<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.560> size<00:01:43.829> hold<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so this is the same size hold that a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
so this is the same size hold that a
floppy<00:01:44.640> drive<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.899> what

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
floppy drive would go in that's what

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
floppy drive would go in that's what
this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> built<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> into<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.820> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
this is built to into so I have to do is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
this is built to into so I have to do is
slide<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.860> there

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
slide that right in there and then there

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.910 
slide that right in there and then there
are<00:01:50.340> four<00:01:50.670> screw<00:01:51.030> holes<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.799> I'm

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
are four screw holes right here that I'm

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.950 
are four screw holes right here that I'm
going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.220> four<00:01:53.250> screws<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> then

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
going to put four screws in and then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.830 
going to put four screws in and then
slide<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:57.090> once<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.390> slide<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
slide this in and then once I slide it
