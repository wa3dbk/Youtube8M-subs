hello<00:00:00.750> everybody<00:00:01.230> toast<00:00:01.770> bomb<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.220> today

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello everybody toast bomb here today

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.710 
hello everybody toast bomb here today
we're<00:00:02.610> gonna<00:00:02.730> be<00:00:02.879> talking<00:00:03.060> about<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.449> topic

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
we're gonna be talking about a topic

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.230 
we're gonna be talking about a topic
that<00:00:04.259> piggybacks<00:00:04.680> off<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> topic<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.120> was

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
that piggybacks off of the topic I was

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.639 
that piggybacks off of the topic I was
talking<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.629> few<00:00:06.839> days<00:00:06.930> ago<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
talking about a few days ago and that is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.440 
talking about a few days ago and that is
what<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.220> best<00:00:08.490> sensitivity<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> play

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
what is the best sensitivity to play

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720 
what is the best sensitivity to play
today<00:00:10.139> we're<00:00:10.590> gonna<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.860> talking<00:00:10.980> about<00:00:11.219> why

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
today we're gonna be talking about why

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
today we're gonna be talking about why
the<00:00:11.790> high<00:00:12.179> sensitivities<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.110> bad<00:00:13.500> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the high sensitivities are bad in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.950 
the high sensitivities are bad in
general<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.330> something<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.660> kind<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
general because it's something I kind of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.599 
general because it's something I kind of
brushed<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> didn't<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.369> talk

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
brushed over and I didn't really talk

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.570 
brushed over and I didn't really talk
about<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.390> much<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.439> video<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.160> keep<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
about that much in the video to keep it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970 
about that much in the video to keep it
inside<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.390> amount<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> time<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.410> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
inside the amount of time that I had so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.210 
inside the amount of time that I had so
anyways<00:00:23.460> let's<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.650> alright<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> all

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
anyways let's go alright so first of all

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.250 
anyways let's go alright so first of all
let's<00:00:26.400> look<00:00:26.460> at<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.880> controller<00:00:27.390> pick<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> up

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
let's look at your controller pick it up

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.109 
let's look at your controller pick it up
move<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> sticks<00:00:29.429> around<00:00:29.580> wiggle<00:00:30.029> them

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
move the sticks around wiggle them

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.250 
move the sticks around wiggle them
around<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.199> very<00:00:31.529> much<00:00:31.740> movement<00:00:32.279> room

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
around they have very much movement room

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.020 
around they have very much movement room
no<00:00:34.260> there's<00:00:34.680> only<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> centimeter

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
no there's only about like a centimeter

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
no there's only about like a centimeter
maybe<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> little<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> centimeter<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
maybe a little more than a centimeter on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
maybe a little more than a centimeter on
either<00:00:38.370> side<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> stick<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> move

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
either side of the stick for it to move

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
either side of the stick for it to move
so<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> total<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:40.980> two

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so there's a total of like two

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
so there's a total of like two
centimeters<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.320> stick<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.340> move

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
centimeters for this stick to move

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.360 
centimeters for this stick to move
around<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.450> isn't<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.140> much<00:00:46.440> now

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
around which really isn't very much now

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
around which really isn't very much now
only<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.850> eighty<00:00:48.210> percent<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> time

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
only about eighty percent of the time

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400 
only about eighty percent of the time
you're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.920> only<00:00:50.190> require<00:00:51.140> slow<00:00:52.140> moving

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you're going to only require slow moving

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
you're going to only require slow moving
activities<00:00:53.399> such<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:53.910> turning<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> corner<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
activities such as turning a corner that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
activities such as turning a corner that
doesn't<00:00:55.410> require<00:00:55.649> anything<00:00:56.219> that's<00:00:56.399> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
doesn't require anything that's really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
doesn't require anything that's really
high<00:00:56.879> speed<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.600> staying<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> target<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
high speed or staying on target which is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
high speed or staying on target which is
actually<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> very<00:00:59.699> helpful<00:01:00.030> thing<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.930> have

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
actually a very helpful thing to have

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
actually a very helpful thing to have
something<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:01.920> slow<00:01:02.370> turning<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
something that is much slow turning so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.210 
something that is much slow turning so
you<00:01:03.719> could<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.989> much<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.350> accurate<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.010> stay

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you could be much more accurate to stay

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
you could be much more accurate to stay
on<00:01:05.339> target<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.299> 20%<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.290> time<00:01:07.500> you're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
on target the other 20% of time you're

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
on target the other 20% of time you're
going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> require<00:01:08.340> very<00:01:09.000> fast<00:01:09.119> movements

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
going to require very fast movements

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080 
going to require very fast movements
just<00:01:10.110> turning<00:01:10.830> around<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.280> run<00:01:11.430> away<00:01:11.700> or

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just turning around to run away or

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
just turning around to run away or
snapping<00:01:12.930> onto<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> target

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
snapping onto a target

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
snapping onto a target
really<00:01:14.340> quick<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.119> start<00:01:15.509> putting

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
really quick so you can start putting

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.950 
really quick so you can start putting
shots<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.340> now<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> one

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
shots down now if you go with the one

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380 
shots down now if you go with the one
sensitivity<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.250> pretty<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.640> opens<00:01:21.180> up

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
sensitivity that pretty much opens up

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.969 
sensitivity that pretty much opens up
that<00:01:21.750> entire<00:01:22.350> 2<00:01:23.070> centimeter<00:01:23.610> range<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.240> only

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
that entire 2 centimeter range to only

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.170 
that entire 2 centimeter range to only
turning<00:01:25.979> slow<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.610> doesn't<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
turning slow it doesn't have the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
turning slow it doesn't have the
potential<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.829> fast<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
potential to go very fast so this is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
potential to go very fast so this is
good<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.650> precise

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
good if you want to be very very precise

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
good if you want to be very very precise
but<00:01:32.460> obviously<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> doesn't<00:01:33.270> meet<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
but obviously it doesn't meet that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
but obviously it doesn't meet that
potential<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.040> other<00:01:35.220> 20%<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
potential for that other 20% of the time

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.620 
potential for that other 20% of the time
that<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.829> important<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> have

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
that is really really important to have

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.060 
that is really really important to have
now<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> other<00:01:40.320> extreme<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
now if you go to the other extreme and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149 
now if you go to the other extreme and
go<00:01:41.490> 10<00:01:41.880> sensitivity<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:43.170> choking<00:01:43.799> down

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
go 10 sensitivity you're choking down

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.609 
go 10 sensitivity you're choking down
the<00:01:44.460> range<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.840> allow<00:01:46.290> for

the range that you have to allow for

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.980 
the range that you have to allow for
slow<00:01:47.220> turning<00:01:47.610> movement<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.720> it's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
slow turning movement so much it's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.319 
slow turning movement so much it's
almost<00:01:49.470> non-existent<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:51.149> pretty

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
almost non-existent and you're pretty

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
almost non-existent and you're pretty
much<00:01:51.479> dedicating<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> entire<00:01:53.040> range<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.790> the

which<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.490> only<00:01:59.759> 20%<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.290> you're<00:02:01.439> doing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
which is only 20% of what you're doing

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
which is only 20% of what you're doing
which<00:02:02.310> doesn't<00:02:02.850> make<00:02:02.969> any<00:02:03.180> sense<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.530> why

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
which doesn't make any sense this is why

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.950 
which doesn't make any sense this is why
3<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.759> 5<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
3 to 5 is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.889 
3 to 5 is
such<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.080> good<00:02:07.530> range<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.000> allows<00:02:09.479> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
such a good range because it allows for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.949 
such a good range because it allows for
you<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.380> have<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:11.009> large<00:02:11.760> portion<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> stick

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
you to have a large portion of the stick

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.690 
you to have a large portion of the stick
for<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.500> activity<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.100> gonna<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.430> doing

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
for the activity you're gonna be doing

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.059 
for the activity you're gonna be doing
the<00:02:14.819> most<00:02:15.120> which<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.660> fine<00:02:16.170> adjustments<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
the most which is fine adjustments and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.400 
the most which is fine adjustments and
then<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.580> has<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> small<00:02:18.030> portion<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> stick

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
then it has a small portion of the stick

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.880 
then it has a small portion of the stick
that<00:02:19.950> allows<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:21.030> very<00:02:21.300> or<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.350> least<00:02:22.560> not

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that allows for very or at least not

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
that allows for very or at least not
quite<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.700> fast<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.270> ten<00:02:24.540> sensitivity<00:02:25.170> but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
quite as fast as ten sensitivity but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.280 
quite as fast as ten sensitivity but
more<00:02:26.069> quick<00:02:26.760> movements<00:02:27.390> than<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> would<00:02:28.080> on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
more quick movements than you would on

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.760 
more quick movements than you would on
that<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:28.890> low<00:02:29.190> slow<00:02:29.790> low<00:02:30.510> end<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.170> one

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
that very low slow low end on one

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.850 
that very low slow low end on one
sensitivity<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.200> reason<00:02:34.440> that

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
sensitivity so that is the reason that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.350 
sensitivity so that is the reason that
three<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.850> five<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.870> good<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.380> ten<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:38.040> just

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
three to five is so good in ten is just

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.750 
three to five is so good in ten is just
not<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.660> great<00:02:39.989> because<00:02:40.470> you're<00:02:40.950> allocating

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
not so great because you're allocating

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.449 
not so great because you're allocating
almost<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.900> entire<00:02:43.260> stick<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:44.070> an<00:02:44.160> activity

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
almost the entire stick to an activity

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.910 
almost the entire stick to an activity
you're<00:02:44.790> only<00:02:45.030> doing<00:02:45.450> twenty<00:02:46.410> percent<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you're only doing twenty percent of the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
time now of course this can vary from

it<00:02:55.980> could<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.250> whatever<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:57.209> say<00:02:57.780> you're

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it could be whatever now say you're

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.790 
it could be whatever now say you're
playing<00:02:58.019> Grifball

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
playing Grifball

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000 
playing Grifball
most<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> time<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.930> are<00:03:00.959> doing<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
most of the time you are doing that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.759 
most of the time you are doing that
really<00:03:02.280> fast<00:03:02.900> snapping<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.050> objects<00:03:04.560> probably

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
really fast snapping to objects probably

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.300 
really fast snapping to objects probably
more<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.870> 95<00:03:06.870> percent<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> time<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
more like 95 percent of the time that is

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.370 
more like 95 percent of the time that is
gonna<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.640> what<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.940> required<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.959> in<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
gonna be what is required so in that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.729 
gonna be what is required so in that
scenario<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> those<00:03:12.510> fast<00:03:12.930> movements<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
scenario then those fast movements and

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.039 
scenario then those fast movements and
high<00:03:14.220> sensitivities<00:03:14.910> are<00:03:15.180> very<00:03:15.540> important

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
high sensitivities are very important

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.800 
high sensitivities are very important
and<00:03:16.260> are<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.860> good<00:03:17.549> thing<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.420> if

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and are a very good thing because if

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.880 
and are a very good thing because if
you're<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> lower<00:03:19.440> end

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
you're on the lower end

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.430 
you're on the lower end
you'd<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.400> dedicating<00:03:21.030> more<00:03:21.299> area<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.140> that

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you'd be dedicating more area of that

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.500 
you'd be dedicating more area of that
stick<00:03:22.920> because<00:03:23.579> you've<00:03:23.730> only<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.239> such<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
stick because you've only have such a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
stick because you've only have such a
limited<00:03:24.989> range<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:26.190> an<00:03:26.459> activity<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.570> not

limited range to an activity that's not

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.050 
limited range to an activity that's not
very<00:03:28.049> important<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.220> used<00:03:29.549> very<00:03:29.670> often

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
very important and not used very often

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.020 
very important and not used very often
for<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.200> specific<00:03:31.769> game<00:03:31.980> type<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.760> can

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
for that specific game type so it can

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.050 
for that specific game type so it can
vary<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.690> game<00:03:34.019> type<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.440> game<00:03:34.650> game<00:03:35.549> type<00:03:35.760> or

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
vary from game type to game game type or

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
vary from game type to game game type or
gain<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.079> game<00:03:37.290> whatever<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> just

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
gain to game whatever it is you just

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.130 
gain to game whatever it is you just
kind<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.670> have<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.940> observe<00:03:39.360> what<00:03:39.989> are<00:03:40.049> you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
kind of have to observe what are you

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.949 
kind of have to observe what are you
doing<00:03:40.440> most<00:03:40.620> often<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.430> turning<00:03:42.030> really

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
doing most often is the turning really

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.350 
doing most often is the turning really
quick<00:03:43.350> stuff<00:03:43.620> super<00:03:44.190> important<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.180> the

quick stuff super important in the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.759 
quick stuff super important in the
integral<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.620> play<00:03:47.130> in<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.700> game<00:03:47.989> or<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.380> it

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
integral to play in that game or is it

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.349 
integral to play in that game or is it
just<00:03:49.799> kind<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.489> thing<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.030> useful

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
just kind of a thing that is useful

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.990 
just kind of a thing that is useful
sometimes<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.709> those<00:03:52.890> finer<00:03:53.250> adjustments

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
sometimes but those finer adjustments

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.180 
sometimes but those finer adjustments
are<00:03:54.239> used<00:03:54.570> much<00:03:54.780> more<00:03:54.989> often<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.980> will

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
are used much more often and that will

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.920 
are used much more often and that will
also<00:03:56.730> help<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.269> determine

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
also help you determine

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.110 
also help you determine
what<00:03:58.049> sensitivity<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.769> best<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.819> why

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
what sensitivity is best and that is why

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.630 
what sensitivity is best and that is why
in<00:04:00.420> general<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:01.230> default<00:04:01.769> settings<00:04:02.159> high

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
in general on default settings high

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.390 
in general on default settings high
sensitivities<00:04:03.359> are<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:03.870> generally<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.069> way

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
sensitivities are not generally the way

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.559 
sensitivities are not generally the way
to<00:04:05.459> go<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:06.090> halo

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
to go for halo

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.149 
to go for halo
anyways<00:04:06.900> that'll<00:04:07.319> be<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.709> one<00:04:07.920> I

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
anyways that'll be it for this one I

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.770 
anyways that'll be it for this one I
hope<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.640> cleared<00:04:08.939> up<00:04:09.060> some<00:04:09.299> things<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.750> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
hope that cleared up some things that I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.179 
hope that cleared up some things that I
didn't<00:04:10.079> explain<00:04:10.439> super<00:04:10.859> well<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.129> the

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
didn't explain super well in the

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.250 
didn't explain super well in the
previous<00:04:11.549> video<00:04:11.849> anyways<00:04:12.540> that'll<00:04:12.900> be<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.109> for

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
previous video anyways that'll be it for

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.080 
previous video anyways that'll be it for
this<00:04:13.349> one<00:04:13.590> if<00:04:14.219> you<00:04:14.400> liked<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.760> can<00:04:14.909> leave<00:04:15.060> a

because I post new Halo videos every day
anyways<00:04:19.829> thank<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.130> for<00:04:20.220> watching<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.970> it
