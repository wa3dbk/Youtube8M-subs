00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360 

oh<00:00:00.060> all<00:00:00.510> that<00:00:00.589> programming<00:00:01.589> we're<00:00:01.979> just<00:00:02.159> going

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
oh all that programming we're just going

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.710 
oh all that programming we're just going
to<00:00:02.429> make<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.639> whole<00:00:02.879> bunch<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.149> chips<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.510> wire

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
to make a whole bunch of chips and wire

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.590 
to make a whole bunch of chips and wire
them<00:00:03.750> together<00:00:04.970> incense<00:00:05.970> its<00:00:06.210> programming

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
them together incense its programming

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.440 
them together incense its programming
and<00:00:06.870> since<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.350> not<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.910> called<00:00:08.910> half

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and since it's not so called half

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.789 
and since it's not so called half
program<00:00:10.019> any<00:00:10.260> guess<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:13.320> remove<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
program any guess so just remove that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
program any guess so just remove that
and<00:00:14.570> you'll<00:00:15.570> see<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:16.020> walk<00:00:16.260> by<00:00:16.470> won't<00:00:16.680> suit

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and you'll see my walk by won't suit

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.349 
and you'll see my walk by won't suit
anymore<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> let's<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:20.460> you're<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
anymore so let's make you're going to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.650 
anymore so let's make you're going to
need<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:22.189> constant<00:00:23.189> value<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.670> zero<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
need a constant value of zero so in the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.439 
need a constant value of zero so in the
input<00:00:25.050> output<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.609> constant<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.240> all

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
input output now this constant about all

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.359 
input output now this constant about all
the<00:00:27.570> saying<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.019> whenever<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.980> connected

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the saying is whenever this is connected

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
the saying is whenever this is connected
to<00:00:29.880> something<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.420> always<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
to something it's always just going to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
to something it's always just going to
say<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> same<00:00:31.500> number<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.489> said<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.120> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
say the same number where we said to you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
say the same number where we said to you
can<00:00:34.050> multiple<00:00:34.469> numbers<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.100> say<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
can multiple numbers that can say so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
can multiple numbers that can say so
I'll<00:00:35.820> show<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.090> how<00:00:36.270> multiple<00:00:36.719> numbers<00:00:37.050> would

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I'll show you how multiple numbers would

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.290 
I'll show you how multiple numbers would
work<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> set<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.710> values<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:42.030> only

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
work so set this to two values you only

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150 
work so set this to two values you only
need<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> need<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:43.739> value<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
need one and you need the first value to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.660 
need one and you need the first value to
be<00:00:44.250> 0<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.719> need<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.230> value<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.950> 0<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
be 0 or we need a value to be 0 and you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.600 
be 0 or we need a value to be 0 and you
need<00:00:47.969> tab<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> down<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.550> has

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
need tab it down now you can see it has

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
need tab it down now you can see it has
two<00:00:51.090> values<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
two values now we're going to get a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.760 
two values now we're going to get a
comparison<00:00:53.640> gate<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.079> under<00:00:55.379> wire

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
comparison gate you can go under wire

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.869 
comparison gate you can go under wire
tools<00:00:56.160> gate<00:00:57.680> open<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> comparison<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.609> into

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
tools gate open the comparison get into

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
tools gate open the comparison get into
greater<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.109> same

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
greater than which is what we need same

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.759 
greater than which is what we need same
tool<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.030> used<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> expression<00:01:04.439> game

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
tool that we used in the expression game

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.380 
tool that we used in the expression game
or<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> wire<00:01:06.479> control<00:01:07.049> gate

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
or you can go to wire control gate

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
or you can go to wire control gate
comparison<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.290> choose<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
comparison and then just choose it that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080 
comparison and then just choose it that
way<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.799> then<00:01:13.799> okay

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
way and then okay

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.260 
way and then okay
so<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:17.799> we're<00:01:17.979> checking<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.939> greater

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
so now we're checking this is greater

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.010 
so now we're checking this is greater
than<00:01:19.420> zero<00:01:19.719> but<00:01:20.079> when<00:01:20.679> you<00:01:20.890> wire<00:01:21.159> a<00:01:21.810> wire<00:01:22.810> wire

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
than zero but when you wire a wire wire

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.169 
than zero but when you wire a wire wire
wire<00:01:23.259> look<00:01:23.859> for<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.130> work<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:26.579> b<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.789> going<00:01:28.119> to

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
wire look for the work so b is going to

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.120 
wire look for the work so b is going to
be<00:01:28.270> 0<00:01:28.630> but<00:01:28.929> since<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.530> multiple<00:01:29.740> values

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
be 0 but since you have multiple values

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.910 
be 0 but since you have multiple values
they'll<00:01:30.490> choose<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.210> value<00:01:31.539> by<00:01:31.719> by<00:01:32.469> clicking

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
they'll choose your value by by clicking

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.859 
they'll choose your value by by clicking
right<00:01:33.130> click<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.909> can<00:01:33.969> change<00:01:34.450> what<00:01:34.719> you're

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
right click you can change what you're

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.740 
right click you can change what you're
choosing<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.579> we<00:01:36.789> want<00:01:37.030> value<00:01:37.329> one<00:01:39.750> since

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
choosing so we want value one since

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.770 
choosing so we want value one since
that's<00:01:40.959> 0<00:01:41.439> 1<00:01:41.649> or<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:41.920> wire<00:01:42.909> via<00:01:43.149> it's<00:01:43.420> up<00:01:43.630> to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
that's 0 1 or the wire via it's up to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.979 
that's 0 1 or the wire via it's up to
the<00:01:43.899> 0<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:48.340> gets<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.819> from<00:01:49.030> this<00:01:49.239> so<00:01:49.780> is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:49.989 
the 0 so it gets a from this so is

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.429 
the 0 so it gets a from this so is
Ranger<00:01:50.560> grow<00:01:50.829> than<00:01:51.189> constant<00:01:51.819> value<00:01:52.209> and<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
Ranger grow than constant value and it

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.969 
Ranger grow than constant value and it
will<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.759> now<00:01:54.789> 0<00:01:55.270> now<00:01:55.719> be<00:01:55.989> one<00:01:56.200> now<00:01:56.739> these

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
will right now 0 now be one now these

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.800 
will right now 0 now be one now these
terms<00:01:57.310> aren't<00:01:57.549> working<00:01:57.939> because<00:01:58.179> they're<00:01:58.659> not

terms aren't working because they're not

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.800 

now<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.650> have<00:02:05.860> two<00:02:05.980> are<00:02:06.190> all<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.880> them<00:02:07.000> otherwise

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
now I have two are all of them otherwise

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.730 
now I have two are all of them otherwise
they<00:02:09.060> won't<00:02:10.060> work<00:02:10.390> from<00:02:10.990> where<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> found

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
they won't work from where I found

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.800 
they won't work from where I found
because<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.580> still<00:02:12.820> thinks<00:02:13.120> it's<00:02:13.240> connected

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
because it still thinks it's connected

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.980 
because it still thinks it's connected
even<00:02:13.960> though<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.290> not<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.750> glitch

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
even though it's not it's just a glitch

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.810 
even though it's not it's just a glitch
i<00:02:17.140> found<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.890> at<00:02:18.220> least<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.580> glitch<00:02:18.790> that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820
