00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.879
 Japanese and Orientals 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.970
 considers them in general people with 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.820
 great creativity are the great 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.639
 creators of fashions fashions that then 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.640
 They extend and travel all over the world 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.070
 because in Japan they have invented a new 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.730
 fashion that the truth is that it gives 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.539
 what to think is about smiles with led 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.820
 With LED led lighting as you know 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.250
 It is the new lighting technology 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.160
 who spends spends much less than 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 old light bulbs and good the Japanese 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.810
 have taken advantage of this to design some 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.050
 artificial teeth that light up 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.470
 through small led lights 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.020
 led lights so most of 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.540
 people in japan I do not say now but 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.990
 maybe when it came about more or less 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.220
 year and a half since he did not stop buying 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.280
 these contraptions to dentists 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 Japanese 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 let's say that millions of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.770
 Let us imagine smiles down the street to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
 everyone smiling with smile 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.509
 shining is not curious these 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.610
 Japanese the truth is that they create things 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.470
 that one can not even wait 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.570
 and what one least expects is that at 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.910
 this ends up becoming a 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.020
 fashion and that people go to buy it 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.360
 as if it were an article of necessity 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.700
 without a doubt a really strange invention 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.220
 that today I at least where 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.670
 I'm here in Spain because I have not seen it 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.040
 but I know that japan there are many people who 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.400
 puts this kind of smiles or so 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.620
 less it was put it more or less year and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.890
 medium that is when this new one appeared 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.890
 fashion
