00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570 
what are your thoughts on what we just
witnessed<00:00:09.469> I'm<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.650> little<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.010> shocked<00:00:11.280> you

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
witnessed I'm a little bit shocked you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.610 
witnessed I'm a little bit shocked you
know<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> thought<00:00:12.870> Brock<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> come

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
know I thought Brock was going to come

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
know I thought Brock was going to come
out<00:00:13.740> strong<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:14.400> did

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
out strong like he did

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.599 
out strong like he did
I<00:00:15.570> thought<00:00:16.170> Kane's<00:00:16.500> chances<00:00:17.130> would<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.400> better

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I thought Kane's chances would be better

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849 
I thought Kane's chances would be better
if<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.449> went<00:00:18.660> into<00:00:18.960> yo<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.140> fourth<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:19.680> fifth

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
if it went into yo the fourth or fifth

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.689 
if it went into yo the fourth or fifth
round<00:00:21.289> I'm<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.380> little<00:00:22.590> bit<00:00:22.680> shocked<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.160> thought

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
round I'm a little bit shocked I thought

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.810 
round I'm a little bit shocked I thought
Brock<00:00:23.970> might<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.539> him<00:00:24.689> early<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
Brock might I got to him early but you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
Brock might I got to him early but you
know<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:27.029> games<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> hell<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> fighter

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
know what games the hell of a fighter

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
know what games the hell of a fighter
and<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> hell<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.099> job<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> think

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and you get a hell of a job do you think

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
and you get a hell of a job do you think
considering<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> size<00:00:31.260> difference<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
considering the size difference that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.560 
considering the size difference that
he'd<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.250> able<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> manhandle<00:00:33.180> him<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
he'd be able to manhandle him like that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.880 
he'd be able to manhandle him like that
no<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> didn't<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.230> didn't<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.680> think

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
no I didn't I didn't think so I think

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
no I didn't I didn't think so I think
Brock<00:00:35.010> strength<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> size<00:00:35.880> would<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.450> would

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Brock strength and size would over would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.119 
Brock strength and size would over would
overmatching

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
overmatching

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.560 
overmatching
I<00:00:38.280> thought<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I thought it would have to go into a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.000 
I thought it would have to go into a
cardio<00:00:39.930> battle<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:42.469> I'm<00:00:43.469> actually<00:00:43.710> very
