00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.780
 hello in this tutorial I teach you how to do 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.440
 a stuffed duckling with materials 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.440
 simple 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:48.739
 and we took the two big pom-poms and the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.739
 let's join with silicone 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.860
 while it dries we take the foami 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.050
 yellow and let's draw a circle 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.050
 with a diameter of 2 centimeters 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.140
 yes 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.980
 we cut out the circle 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.280
 and we fold it in half 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.030
 on our shores we put a little bit of 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 silicone 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 and we paste 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.930
 let's put it this way 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.630
 Y 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.220
 this will be the peak 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.130
 and we put aside 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.480
 we take the foamy again and go to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.190
 draw two ovals of approximately 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.600
 1.5 centimeters long 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.600
 these will be the legs 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.740
 now let's paste 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.200
 we take the pompoms that we unite and in one 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.520
 of them we are going to open a gap for 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.520
 hit the peak 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.370
 on the bottom we are going to paste the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.620
 legs 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:23.190
 Y 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:26.129
 and we take the mobile eyes or the mini 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.069
 pompoms and we're going to stick them 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.370
 way that the peak opening a small 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.370
 hole 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.130
 and on the other side we do the same 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.060
 m 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.609
 finally we take the bar and we do 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.609
 a bow around the neck of the duck 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.840
 and ready 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.849
 a very easy and simple stuffed duck 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.999
 to do 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:46.259
