Southwest and to talk to you briefly

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.400 
Southwest and to talk to you briefly
about<00:00:12.030> some<00:00:12.480> new<00:00:12.570> technology<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:13.320> we

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
about some new technology that we

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.450 
about some new technology that we
require<00:00:13.830> which<00:00:14.820> will<00:00:15.000> allow<00:00:17.960> different<00:00:19.369> bones

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.519 

now<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> 3d<00:00:23.970> printer<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> size<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
now the 3d printer is about the size of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.370 
now the 3d printer is about the size of
a<00:00:25.740> normal<00:00:26.580> kitchen<00:00:26.789> dishwasher<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
a normal kitchen dishwasher and what it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.580 
a normal kitchen dishwasher and what it
does<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.279> squirts<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> very<00:00:30.119> small

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
does is it squirts out a very small

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.250 
does is it squirts out a very small
stream<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:32.040> melted<00:00:32.820> plastic<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.540> basically

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
stream of melted plastic and basically

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.630 
stream of melted plastic and basically
builds<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> model<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> base<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.530> it

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
builds the model from the base up it

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
builds the model from the base up it
includes<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.110> support<00:00:40.110> material<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
includes a support material which is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
includes a support material which is
dissolved<00:00:41.160> away<00:00:41.399> by<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> chemical<00:00:42.120> reaction

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
dissolved away by a chemical reaction

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
dissolved away by a chemical reaction
and<00:00:42.870> then<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.210> ABS<00:00:45.210> plastic<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.399> what

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and then also ABS plastic which is what

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.930 
and then also ABS plastic which is what
Legos<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.329> made<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.620> waterproof<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
Legos are made of it's waterproof and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
Legos are made of it's waterproof and
it's<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:53.719> biocompatible<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> pretty

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it's also biocompatible which is pretty

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.540 
it's also biocompatible which is pretty
exciting

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
exciting

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.229 
exciting
so<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.840> tip<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
so you can see the the tip of the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.549 
so you can see the the tip of the
machine<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.510> laying<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.289> very

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
machine just laying down a very very

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
machine just laying down a very very
thin<00:01:01.949> layer<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.690> plastic<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> build<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
thin layer of plastic to build the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:15.350 
thin layer of plastic to build the
device<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> bottom<00:01:05.100> up

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.500 

traditionally<00:01:21.710> when<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.890> were<00:01:22.240> examining<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
traditionally when we were examining a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.600 
traditionally when we were examining a
patient<00:01:23.540> for<00:01:24.080> potential<00:01:24.500> surgery<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.460> would

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
patient for potential surgery we would

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.060 
patient for potential surgery we would
just<00:01:25.790> do<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.000> CT<00:01:26.540> scan<00:01:26.870> get<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.290> axial<00:01:27.770> slices

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
just do a CT scan get the axial slices

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.600 
just do a CT scan get the axial slices
and<00:01:28.460> look<00:01:29.180> at<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.260> bone<00:01:30.470> structure<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.280> two

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
and look at the bone structure in two

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.440 
and look at the bone structure in two
dimensions<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:32.660> several<00:01:33.140> sequential<00:01:33.740> slices

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
dimensions on several sequential slices

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.390 
dimensions on several sequential slices
and<00:01:35.450> at<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.470> point<00:01:36.800> we<00:01:36.920> thought<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.280> that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
and at that point we thought that that

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.740 
and at that point we thought that that
was<00:01:37.550> pretty<00:01:37.729> good<00:01:38.000> because<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.390> gave<00:01:38.479> us<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
was pretty good because it gave us a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.359 
was pretty good because it gave us a
real<00:01:38.900> insight<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.530> what<00:01:39.680> was<00:01:39.800> happening<00:01:39.950> on

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
real insight to what was happening on

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.120 
real insight to what was happening on
the<00:01:40.460> inside<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.330> patient<00:01:42.130> further

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the inside of the patient further

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.430 
the inside of the patient further
software<00:01:43.700> development<00:01:44.270> allowed<00:01:44.600> us<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:45.050> 3d

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
software development allowed us to do 3d

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
software development allowed us to do 3d
volume<00:01:46.310> rendered<00:01:46.780> reconstructions<00:01:47.780> which

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
volume rendered reconstructions which

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.359 
volume rendered reconstructions which
allowed<00:01:49.460> us<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.869> three<00:01:51.200> dimensions<00:01:51.800> see

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
allowed us to in three dimensions see

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.639 
allowed us to in three dimensions see
where<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.940> tumor<00:01:53.300> was<00:01:53.330> involved<00:01:54.080> in<00:01:54.410> what

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
where the tumor was involved in what

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.770 
where the tumor was involved in what
anatomic<00:01:55.310> structures<00:01:55.759> were<00:01:55.940> close<00:01:56.180> by<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
anatomic structures were close by and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.880 
anatomic structures were close by and
we're<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.229> be<00:01:57.320> at<00:01:57.410> risk

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
we're going to be at risk

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.550 
we're going to be at risk
now<00:01:58.729> with<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.119> 3d<00:01:59.450> printer<00:01:59.479> technology<00:01:59.960> we

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
now with the 3d printer technology we

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.040 
now with the 3d printer technology we
can<00:02:00.710> actually<00:02:00.740> print<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.610> plastic<00:02:02.180> skull<00:02:02.479> that

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
can actually print a plastic skull that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.210 
can actually print a plastic skull that
we<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.320> hold<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.770> our<00:02:03.860> hands<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.720> do<00:02:06.220> very

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
we can hold in our hands and do very

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.060 
we can hold in our hands and do very
accurate<00:02:07.910> surgical<00:02:08.420> planning<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:09.739> is<00:02:09.890> also

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
accurate surgical planning this is also

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.190 
accurate surgical planning this is also
very<00:02:10.429> helpful<00:02:10.850> for<00:02:11.000> instructing<00:02:11.480> clients<00:02:12.050> as

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
very helpful for instructing clients as

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.690 
very helpful for instructing clients as
to<00:02:12.500> exactly<00:02:12.590> what<00:02:13.040> we're<00:02:13.250> planning<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.670> doing

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
to exactly what we're planning on doing

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.830 
to exactly what we're planning on doing
with<00:02:14.120> their<00:02:14.330> pet

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.620 

now<00:02:18.560> once<00:02:18.800> we<00:02:18.980> have<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.310> plastic<00:02:19.520> model<00:02:19.940> we

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
now once we have the plastic model we

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990 
now once we have the plastic model we
can<00:02:20.840> sit<00:02:21.080> down<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.319> very<00:02:22.069> accurately<00:02:22.640> plan

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
can sit down and very accurately plan

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900 
can sit down and very accurately plan
our<00:02:23.390> surgical<00:02:23.870> approach<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.459> get

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
our surgical approach so that we can get

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.850 
our surgical approach so that we can get
complete<00:02:26.480> surgical<00:02:26.660> margins<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.440> also

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
complete surgical margins and also

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
complete surgical margins and also
predict<00:02:28.730> what<00:02:28.940> Anatomy<00:02:29.599> we're<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> run

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
predict what Anatomy we're going to run

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.130 
predict what Anatomy we're going to run
into<00:02:30.530> when<00:02:30.739> we're<00:02:30.920> doing<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.250> surgery<00:02:32.140> this

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
into when we're doing the surgery this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.620 
into when we're doing the surgery this
really<00:02:33.530> facilitates<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:35.120> surgery<00:02:35.540> and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
really facilitates the surgery and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.680 
really facilitates the surgery and
allows<00:02:35.870> us<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.650> avoid<00:02:37.190> important<00:02:38.180> anatomic

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
allows us to avoid important anatomic

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.559 
allows us to avoid important anatomic
structures<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> also<00:02:40.209> complete<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.330> surgery

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
structures and also complete the surgery

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.400 
structures and also complete the surgery
with<00:02:41.870> less<00:02:42.110> blood<00:02:42.470> loss<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.050> shorter

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
with less blood loss and in a shorter

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:56.390 
with less blood loss and in a shorter
period<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.860> time

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.710 

now<00:02:57.400> another<00:02:57.640> area<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.120> interest<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.540> I've

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
now another area of interest that I've

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960 
now another area of interest that I've
always<00:02:58.900> had<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.380> developing<00:02:59.980> orthopedic

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
always had is developing orthopedic

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.920 
always had is developing orthopedic
devices<00:03:01.350> for<00:03:02.350> patients<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.690> create

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
devices for patients and we can create

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.860 
devices for patients and we can create
prototypes<00:03:05.470> using<00:03:06.100> CAD<00:03:06.730> software<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.660> then

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
prototypes using CAD software that then

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.640 
prototypes using CAD software that then
we<00:03:08.050> can<00:03:08.290> apply<00:03:09.240> either<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.540> plastic<00:03:10.990> models<00:03:11.410> or

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
we can apply either to plastic models or

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.610 
we can apply either to plastic models or
even<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.670> actual<00:03:12.940> patient<00:03:13.450> these<00:03:14.050> devices

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
even to the actual patient these devices

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
even to the actual patient these devices
can<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.040> sterilized<00:03:15.730> using<00:03:17.250> either<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.340> steam

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
can be sterilized using either a steam

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.200 
can be sterilized using either a steam
autoclave<00:03:19.120> or<00:03:19.650> stair<00:03:20.650> add<00:03:20.940> sterilization<00:03:21.940> and

autoclave or stair add sterilization and

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:31.800 
autoclave or stair add sterilization and
can<00:03:22.810> be<00:03:23.050> applied<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.890> clinical<00:03:24.550> settings

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.610 

yeah

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.800 

very<00:03:35.620> detailed<00:03:35.950> plastic<00:03:36.790> models<00:03:37.180> can<00:03:37.660> be

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
very detailed plastic models can be

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.010 
very detailed plastic models can be
printed<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.950> we<00:03:39.070> can<00:03:39.510> explain<00:03:40.510> exactly

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
printed so that we can explain exactly

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.950 
printed so that we can explain exactly
what's<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:42.130> on<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.450> particular
