of stuff but to me this one doesn't look
that<00:04:19.470> good<00:04:19.769> maybe<00:04:20.009> it's<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.729> didn't

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
that good maybe it's because I didn't

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.460 
that good maybe it's because I didn't
really<00:04:21.389> like<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.630> movie<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:22.109> much

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.070 
but I think I like the score I just tap
it<00:05:13.470> more<00:05:13.770> because<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.789> all<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> armor<00:05:15.750> he<00:05:15.960> has

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
it more because of all the armor he has

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.490 
it more because of all the armor he has
on<00:05:16.289> it's<00:05:17.220> really<00:05:17.639> shiny<00:05:17.960> too<00:05:18.960> bad<00:05:19.110> doesn't

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
on it's really shiny too bad doesn't

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.189 
on it's really shiny too bad doesn't
come<00:05:19.620> with<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.860> second<00:05:20.280> mom<00:05:20.460> ask<00:05:20.930> one<00:05:21.930> without

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
come with the second mom ask one without

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.159 
come with the second mom ask one without
the<00:05:23.039> markings<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.789> it<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.659> would<00:05:24.780> be<00:05:24.960> nice

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
the markings on it that would be nice

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.379 
the markings on it that would be nice
kiss<00:05:25.590> initially<00:05:26.370> in<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.610> movie<00:05:26.909> he<00:05:27.120> didn't

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
kiss initially in the movie he didn't

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.200 
kiss initially in the movie he didn't
have<00:05:27.510> to<00:05:27.690> have<00:05:28.169> those<00:05:28.440> markings<00:05:28.949> on<00:05:29.159> but<00:05:29.940> it

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
have to have those markings on but it

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.170 
have to have those markings on but it
was<00:05:30.330> doing<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.590> was<00:05:31.949> like<00:05:32.159> halfway<00:05:32.729> into<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
was doing I was like halfway into the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.460 
was doing I was like halfway into the
movie<00:05:33.510> where<00:05:33.720> he<00:05:33.900> got<00:05:34.020> those<00:05:34.229> on<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:35.310> yeah<00:05:36.000> and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
movie where he got those on but yeah and

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.850 
movie where he got those on but yeah and
yeah<00:05:37.470> this<00:05:37.680> one's<00:05:37.889> nice<00:05:38.130> too<00:05:38.159> so<00:05:39.289> yeah<00:05:40.289> I<00:05:40.320> guess

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
yeah this one's nice too so yeah I guess

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.610 
yeah this one's nice too so yeah I guess
the<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.300> scar<00:05:42.690> would<00:05:42.960> have<00:05:43.169> to<00:05:43.349> be<00:05:43.470> my

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
the the scar would have to be my

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.890 
the the scar would have to be my
favorite<00:05:44.130> right<00:05:44.729> now<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:48.300> last<00:05:48.659> but

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
favorite right now and last but

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.640 
favorite right now and last but
certainly<00:05:48.960> not<00:05:49.800> least<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.940> my<00:05:51.289> 87<00:05:52.289> jungle

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
certainly not least is my 87 jungle

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.920 
certainly not least is my 87 jungle
predator<00:05:53.039> this<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.970> original<00:05:54.389> jungle

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
predator this is the original jungle

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.620 
predator this is the original jungle
predator<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.560> came<00:05:55.800> out<00:05:55.949> from<00:05:56.430> Hot<00:05:57.060> Toys<00:05:57.090> and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
predator that came out from Hot Toys and

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.860 
predator that came out from Hot Toys and
uh<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:59.070> reason<00:05:59.190> I<00:05:59.460> still<00:05:59.699> like<00:05:59.909> this<00:06:00.150> is<00:06:00.419> I

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
uh the reason I still like this is I

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.469 
uh the reason I still like this is I
know<00:06:01.260> he's<00:06:01.590> not<00:06:01.770> accurate<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:03.030> biomass

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
know he's not accurate and the biomass

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.200 
know he's not accurate and the biomass
is<00:06:03.750> all<00:06:03.900> wrong<00:06:04.199> and<00:06:04.710> then

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
is all wrong and then

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.810 
is all wrong and then
the<00:06:05.810> body<00:06:06.080> proportion<00:06:06.710> is<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:07.040> wrong<00:06:07.310> but<00:06:07.610> he

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
the body proportion is all wrong but he

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.180 
the body proportion is all wrong but he
does<00:06:08.030> have<00:06:08.330> quite<00:06:08.930> a<00:06:08.990> lot<00:06:09.320> more<00:06:09.560> articulation

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
does have quite a lot more articulation

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.510 
does have quite a lot more articulation
points<00:06:10.610> than<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.120> current<00:06:11.780> ones<00:06:12.190> you<00:06:13.190> see

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
points than the current ones you see

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.970 
points than the current ones you see
here<00:06:13.790> he<00:06:14.030> has<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.180> bicep<00:06:14.780> swivel<00:06:15.590> and

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
here he has a bicep swivel and

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.740 
here he has a bicep swivel and
double-jointed<00:06:16.430> elbows<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:17.240> double<00:06:17.510> jointed

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
double-jointed elbows and double jointed

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.840 
double-jointed elbows and double jointed
knees<00:06:17.810> that's<00:06:18.620> really<00:06:18.980> good<00:06:19.190> for<00:06:19.430> predators

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
knees that's really good for predators

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.250 
knees that's really good for predators
because<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.420> want<00:06:20.630> him<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:20.930> be<00:06:21.020> able<00:06:21.110> to

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
because you want him to be able to

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.430 
because you want him to be able to
Crouch<00:06:21.940> like<00:06:22.940> an<00:06:23.120> actual<00:06:23.390> predator<00:06:23.840> instead

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
Crouch like an actual predator instead

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.860 
Crouch like an actual predator instead
of<00:06:24.530> just<00:06:24.680> standing<00:06:24.980> around<00:06:25.220> like<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.460> human

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
of just standing around like a human

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.410 
of just standing around like a human
because<00:06:26.870> none<00:06:27.230> of<00:06:27.260> the<00:06:27.440> newer<00:06:27.590> ones<00:06:28.420> has

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
because none of the newer ones has

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.750 
because none of the newer ones has
double<00:06:29.750> jointed<00:06:30.080> knees<00:06:30.140> or<00:06:30.920> elbows<00:06:31.160> so<00:06:31.700> you

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
double jointed knees or elbows so you

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.990 
double jointed knees or elbows so you
can't<00:06:32.150> really<00:06:32.240> give<00:06:32.480> any<00:06:33.280> dynamic<00:06:34.280> poses<00:06:34.550> but

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
can't really give any dynamic poses but

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.250 
can't really give any dynamic poses but
with<00:06:35.180> this<00:06:35.300> one<00:06:35.480> you<00:06:35.690> can<00:06:35.720> still<00:06:35.960> give<00:06:36.170> them

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
with this one you can still give them

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.130 
with this one you can still give them
some<00:06:36.500> dynamic<00:06:36.920> poses<00:06:37.160> he<00:06:38.060> also<00:06:38.210> has<00:06:38.510> an<00:06:38.810> ab

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
some dynamic poses he also has an ab

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.340 
some dynamic poses he also has an ab
crunch<00:06:39.620> right<00:06:39.950> there<00:06:40.220> so<00:06:40.850> yeah<00:06:41.660> as<00:06:41.930> far<00:06:42.290> as

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
crunch right there so yeah as far as

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.510 
crunch right there so yeah as far as
some<00:06:43.030> articulation<00:06:44.030> this<00:06:44.720> one<00:06:44.960> is<00:06:45.140> uh<00:06:45.170> it's<00:06:45.920> by

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
some articulation this one is uh it's by

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.360 
some articulation this one is uh it's by
far<00:06:46.730> the<00:06:46.790> best<00:06:46.910> at<00:06:47.720> all<00:06:47.930> the<00:06:48.110> ones<00:06:48.260> I<00:06:48.440> have<00:06:48.470> but

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
far the best at all the ones I have but

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.930 
far the best at all the ones I have but
I<00:06:49.670> think<00:06:49.820> n<00:06:50.360> he<00:06:50.630> is<00:06:50.870> totally<00:06:51.740> not<00:06:51.950> film

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
I think n he is totally not film

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.060 
I think n he is totally not film
accurate<00:06:53.360> as<00:06:53.750> far<00:06:54.020> as<00:06:54.140> proportion<00:06:54.650> wise<00:06:54.770> and

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 
accurate as far as proportion wise and

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.500 
accurate as far as proportion wise and
dreads<00:06:55.940> kind<00:06:56.420> of<00:06:56.480> we're<00:06:56.660> looking<00:06:56.690> and<00:06:58.180> yeah<00:06:59.180> so

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
dreads kind of we're looking and yeah so

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.720 
dreads kind of we're looking and yeah so
even<00:06:59.900> the<00:06:59.960> biomass<00:07:00.350> is<00:07:00.590> kind<00:07:00.830> of<00:07:00.890> wrong<00:07:01.100> so

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
even the biomass is kind of wrong so

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.570 
even the biomass is kind of wrong so
yeah<00:07:02.390> not<00:07:03.260> my<00:07:03.440> favorite<00:07:03.770> but<00:07:04.040> it's<00:07:04.310> definitely
