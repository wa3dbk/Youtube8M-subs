00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.639 
hi this is Alex and following on from my
video<00:00:04.140> yesterday<00:00:04.290> about<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:06.230> bromo<00:00:07.230> mod<00:00:07.440> for

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
video yesterday about the bromo mod for

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.040 
video yesterday about the bromo mod for
the<00:00:07.740> year<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.130> thought<00:00:08.519> I'd<00:00:08.670> introduce<00:00:09.570> people

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
the year I thought I'd introduce people

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.480 
the year I thought I'd introduce people
to<00:00:10.260> scripts<00:00:10.769> as<00:00:10.980> well<00:00:11.190> I've<00:00:12.090> been<00:00:12.360> written

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
to scripts as well I've been written

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.970 
to scripts as well I've been written
that<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.570> come<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> similar<00:00:16.440> thing<00:00:16.650> but

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that do that come do a similar thing but

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.130 
that do that come do a similar thing but
can<00:00:17.100> also<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.490> more<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.910> top<00:00:18.150> they're<00:00:18.990> more

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
can also do more on top they're more

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.000 
can also do more on top they're more
powerful<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:20.039> ways<00:00:21.230> an<00:00:22.230> often<00:00:22.590> simpler

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
powerful in some ways an often simpler

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.859 
powerful in some ways an often simpler
as<00:00:23.160> well<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> end<00:00:24.150> user<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.750> able

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
as well for for the end user to be able

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.439 
as well for for the end user to be able
to<00:00:24.930> actually<00:00:25.050> put<00:00:25.380> onto<00:00:25.560> their<00:00:25.800> camera<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to actually put onto their camera so I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.930 
to actually put onto their camera so I
came<00:00:28.080> across<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:29.400> yesterday<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
came across this one yesterday that is a

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
came across this one yesterday that is a
resolution<00:00:32.940> bump<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.410> standard<00:00:35.040> 1920

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
resolution bump from the standard 1920

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
resolution bump from the standard 1920
by<00:00:35.820> 1080<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.640> two<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> half<00:00:38.940> K<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.450> there

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
by 1080 up to two and a half K of there

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.369 
by 1080 up to two and a half K of there
abouts<00:00:41.540> 2305<00:00:42.540> 1296<00:00:43.969> rather<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.149> report<00:00:45.600> near

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
abouts 2305 1296 rather our report near

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
abouts 2305 1296 rather our report near
the<00:00:46.469> end<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.809> just

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the end of this that it's actually just

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
the end of this that it's actually just
an<00:00:49.140> upscale<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.100> truly<00:00:50.760> doing<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
an upscale and it's not truly doing that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
an upscale and it's not truly doing that
resolution<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> thought<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
resolution but I thought I would have a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.439 
resolution but I thought I would have a
go<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> test<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.480> anyway<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:56.239> another<00:00:57.239> use

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
go and test it anyway and another use

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
go and test it anyway and another use
for<00:00:57.480> scripts<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:59.149> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> actually

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
for scripts is that you can actually

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.039 
for scripts is that you can actually
change<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.699> bitrate<00:01:05.150> using<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.869> rather

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
change the bitrate using these so rather

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
change the bitrate using these so rather
than<00:01:07.170> creating<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.650> own<00:01:07.710> firmware<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
than creating your own firmware you can

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
than creating your own firmware you can
actually<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:10.260> scripts<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually just use these scripts that you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
actually just use these scripts that you
place<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> top<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> SD<00:01:12.270> card<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
place at the top of the SD card and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.870 
place at the top of the SD card and
every<00:01:13.740> time<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> camera<00:01:14.369> turns<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.450> will

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
every time the camera turns on it will

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
every time the camera turns on it will
take<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.180> settings<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.930> apply<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.530> for

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
take those settings and apply them for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.609 
take those settings and apply them for
that<00:01:20.369> session<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.530> as

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that session that it's on and for as

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
that session that it's on and for as
long<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.659> file<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> root<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
long as that file is on the root of the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.969 
long as that file is on the root of the
sdcard<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> yeah<00:01:27.330> I'll<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.960> into<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.950> more

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
sdcard so yeah I'll go into a bit more

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.640 
sdcard so yeah I'll go into a bit more

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
I'm gonna come across the resolution but

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.780 
I'm gonna come across the resolution but
I'll<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.500> show<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.799> here<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.099> bit<00:02:15.459> rate<00:02:15.640> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
I'll just show you here a bit rate you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.250 
I'll just show you here a bit rate you
can<00:02:15.940> actually<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.269> flash<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.840> these<00:02:16.989> and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
can actually just flash one of these and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.080 
can actually just flash one of these and
I'll<00:02:17.349> have<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.650> same<00:02:17.680> effect<00:02:18.190> as<00:02:18.519> if<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.909> made

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
I'll have the same effect as if you made

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
I'll have the same effect as if you made
your<00:02:19.209> own<00:02:19.269> firmware<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.069> little<00:02:21.280> bit

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
your own firmware but it's a little bit

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.740 
your own firmware but it's a little bit

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
limited at the moment in the fact that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.610 
limited at the moment in the fact that
he's<00:02:23.110> only<00:02:23.290> got<00:02:24.720> them<00:02:25.720> available<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.260> 1080p

I'm resolution blunt well before I put
that<00:02:42.790> into<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:44.190> onto<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.220> year<00:02:45.549> myself<00:02:45.730> and

I'll show you how to do that well she
got<00:02:49.690> another<00:02:49.989> script<00:02:50.349> here<00:02:50.500> as<00:02:50.650> well<00:02:50.829> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
got another script here as well and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.599 
got another script here as well and
other<00:02:52.030> two<00:02:52.209> scripts<00:02:52.540> I've<00:02:53.290> got<00:02:53.620> one<00:02:54.040> enables

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
other two scripts I've got one enables

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.420 
other two scripts I've got one enables
HDR<00:02:55.209> for<00:02:55.540> stills<00:02:55.840> which<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:57.569> really<00:02:58.569> good

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
HDR for stills which is a really good

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.490 
HDR for stills which is a really good
especially<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.730> people<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.720> edit

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
especially for people that like to edit

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.229 
especially for people that like to edit
their<00:03:02.620> images<00:03:03.040> using<00:03:03.549> Lightroom<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
their images using Lightroom and

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.910 
their images using Lightroom and
Photoshop<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:05.019> things<00:03:05.140> like<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.319> which

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
Photoshop and things like that which

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.369 
Photoshop and things like that which
gives<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.519> flexibility<00:03:07.379> and

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
gives you a lot more flexibility and

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.220 
gives you a lot more flexibility and
there's<00:03:09.069> also<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.430> here<00:03:09.549> if<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> HDR<00:03:10.230> which

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
there's also one here if the HDR which

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.690 
there's also one here if the HDR which
would<00:03:11.409> be<00:03:11.470> very<00:03:11.680> cool<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.099> well<00:03:12.129> I<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.400> it's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
would be very cool as well I think it's

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.039 
would be very cool as well I think it's
stack<00:03:12.940> six<00:03:13.299> images<00:03:13.680> at<00:03:14.680> ISO<00:03:15.159> 100<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:16.750> gonna

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
stack six images at ISO 100 I'm gonna

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.250 
stack six images at ISO 100 I'm gonna
try<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.829> RFK<00:03:20.069> yeah<00:03:21.069> we've<00:03:21.340> got<00:03:21.489> two<00:03:21.730> and

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
try the in RFK yeah we've got two and

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.509 
try the in RFK yeah we've got two and
I'm<00:03:23.260> gonna<00:03:23.560> try<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.859> 25<00:03:24.430> megabit<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.310> again

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
I'm gonna try the 25 megabit so again

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.140 
I'm gonna try the 25 megabit so again
like<00:03:27.669> the<00:03:27.790> firmware<00:03:28.030> mod<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.470> we<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.859> copy

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
like the firmware mod and we just copy

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.460 
like the firmware mod and we just copy
no<00:03:31.150> need<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.480> rename<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:32.019> time<00:03:32.290> we<00:03:32.440> just

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
no need to rename it this time we just

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.360 
no need to rename it this time we just
leave<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.859> as<00:03:32.919> auto<00:03:33.099> exact<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.980> will<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.160> plug

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
leave it as auto exact I will just plug

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:51.900 
leave it as auto exact I will just plug
in<00:03:36.519> my<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.980> there<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.310> right<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:51.129> I'll<00:03:51.609> place

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
in my and there is right so I'll place

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.330 
in my and there is right so I'll place
that<00:03:51.940> here<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.750> cannot<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.560> I'll

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
that here and this cannot be and I'll

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.300 
that here and this cannot be and I'll
jump<00:03:58.000> over<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:58.720> my<00:03:59.680> other<00:03:59.769> camera<00:04:00.040> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
jump over to the my other camera and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.110 
jump over to the my other camera and
show<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.549> what<00:04:00.669> that<00:04:00.819> looks<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:02.879> okay<00:04:03.879> so

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
show you what that looks like okay so

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.199 
show you what that looks like okay so
I'll<00:04:04.359> just<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:05.019> left<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.290> computer<00:04:06.209> and

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
I'll just just left the computer and

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.390 
I'll just just left the computer and
I've<00:04:07.329> still<00:04:07.480> got<00:04:07.629> it<00:04:07.720> plugged<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.079> so<00:04:08.980> I

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
I've still got it plugged in so I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.960 
I've still got it plugged in so I
believe<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.090> all<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.239> should<00:04:10.449> have<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.690> do<00:04:10.810> is

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
believe that all I should have to do is

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.500 
believe that all I should have to do is
unplug<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.299> from<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> computer<00:04:15.209> turns<00:04:16.209> itself

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
unplug it from the computer turns itself

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.830 
unplug it from the computer turns itself
off<00:04:16.720> turn<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.769> on<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:22.330> wait<00:04:22.419> for<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.659> to<00:04:22.750> power

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
off turn it on and wait for it to power

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.550 
off turn it on and wait for it to power
up

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.770 

right<00:04:29.750> I'll<00:04:30.750> come<00:04:31.260> over<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.770> app<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.780> see

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
right I'll come over to the app and see

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.870 
right I'll come over to the app and see
if<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.020> actually<00:04:34.169> worked<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:40.729> don't<00:04:41.729> if<00:04:41.790> you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
if it's actually worked and don't if you

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.760 
if it's actually worked and don't if you
can<00:04:42.000> see<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.330> though<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:44.150> 23:04<00:04:45.150> by<00:04:45.389> 1296<00:04:46.169> up

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
can see that though but 23:04 by 1296 up

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.550 
can see that though but 23:04 by 1296 up
30<00:04:47.280> frames<00:04:47.669> per<00:04:47.760> second<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.479> that<00:04:49.410> has

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
30 frames per second so that has

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.760 
30 frames per second so that has
actually<00:04:50.389> taken<00:04:51.389> effect<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.960> I'll<00:04:55.410> see<00:04:55.590> the

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
actually taken effect and I'll see the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.439 
actually taken effect and I'll see the
preview<00:04:56.190> actually<00:04:56.460> works<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:03.270> does

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
preview actually works and it it does

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.210 
preview actually works and it it does
appear<00:05:03.720> -<00:05:03.900> which<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.260> amazing<00:05:05.360> right<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:08.190> I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
appear - which is amazing right so I

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.159 
appear - which is amazing right so I
think<00:05:08.370> I'll<00:05:08.639> test<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:09.150> over<00:05:09.389> that<00:05:09.510> day<00:05:09.810> or<00:05:09.960> so

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
think I'll test that over that day or so

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.640 
think I'll test that over that day or so
and<00:05:10.380> I'll<00:05:11.310> make<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.550> follow-up<00:05:11.910> video<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:13.410> let

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and I'll make a follow-up video and let

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.719 
and I'll make a follow-up video and let
you<00:05:13.740> know<00:05:13.860> how<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.190> goes

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
you know how that goes

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.879 
you know how that goes
I<00:05:14.760> just<00:05:15.690> walked<00:05:15.870> right<00:05:16.020> on<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.380> entities<00:05:16.680> of

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
I just walked right on the entities of

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.189 
I just walked right on the entities of
this<00:05:17.520> video<00:05:17.850> some<00:05:18.360> proof<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:19.050> actually

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
this video some proof that this actually

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.750 
this video some proof that this actually
works<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.870> took<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.080> quick<00:05:22.289> example<00:05:22.800> in<00:05:23.460> my

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
works I just took a quick example in my

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.240 
works I just took a quick example in my
room<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.600> as<00:05:25.139> you<00:05:25.320> can<00:05:25.440> see<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.830> it's<00:05:26.010> their

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
room and as you can see you it's their

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.230 
room and as you can see you it's their
brains<00:05:26.550> per<00:05:26.669> second

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
brains per second

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.390 
brains per second
but<00:05:28.080> I'm<00:05:28.889> 3:04<00:05:29.789> why<00:05:30.000> 1296<00:05:30.750> at<00:05:31.260> 25<00:05:31.860> megabits<00:05:32.280> per

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
but I'm 3:04 why 1296 at 25 megabits per

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.330 
but I'm 3:04 why 1296 at 25 megabits per
second<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:34.110> has<00:05:34.320> actually<00:05:34.680> taken<00:05:34.889> effect

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
second so it has actually taken effect

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.200 
second so it has actually taken effect
and<00:05:36.830> I'll<00:05:37.830> have<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.280> look<00:05:38.490> over<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.849> video

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
and I'll have a look over the video

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.710 
and I'll have a look over the video
later<00:05:39.450> on<00:05:39.979> try<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.160> decent<00:05:41.550> 1080p<00:05:42.120> footage<00:05:42.360> as

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
later on try and decent 1080p footage as

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.890 
later on try and decent 1080p footage as
well<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:44.060> zoom<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.419> see<00:05:45.599> if<00:05:45.660> there's

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
well and and zoom in and see if there's

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.779 
well and and zoom in and see if there's
any<00:05:46.020> more<00:05:46.410> detail<00:05:46.830> actually<00:05:47.010> there<00:05:47.370> or

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
any more detail actually there or

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.360 
any more detail actually there or
whether<00:05:48.240> is<00:05:48.479> just<00:05:48.870> an<00:05:48.990> upscale<00:05:49.410> like<00:05:49.680> some

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
whether is just an upscale like some

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.850 
whether is just an upscale like some
people<00:05:50.610> have<00:05:50.729> been<00:05:50.880> reporting<00:05:51.650> another<00:05:52.650> thing
