00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
step counter which can be used in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
step counter which can be used in
fitness<00:01:33.960> applications<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.729> run<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
fitness applications now we run the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.410 
fitness applications now we run the
antutu<00:01:36.780> benchmark<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.820> fast<00:01:39.090> forward

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
antutu benchmark we have fast forward

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179 
antutu benchmark we have fast forward
all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> benchmarks<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> final

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
all the benchmarks to get to the final

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.130 
all the benchmarks to get to the final
results<00:01:41.579> quickly

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.070 

so<00:01:44.830> we've<00:01:44.950> got<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.070> score<00:01:45.370> of<00:01:45.520> 23,000<00:01:46.479> 43<00:01:46.870> which

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
so we've got a score of 23,000 43 which

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.990 
so we've got a score of 23,000 43 which
is<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.229> really<00:01:47.440> healthy<00:01:47.770> scope<00:01:48.190> it's<00:01:48.400> quite

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
is a really healthy scope it's quite

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.780 
is a really healthy scope it's quite
close<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.470> Nexus<00:01:50.800> 5<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.460> see<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
close to the Nexus 5 and you can see the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.480 
close to the Nexus 5 and you can see the
company<00:01:52.150> also<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:53.260> is<00:01:53.409> just<00:01:53.650> below<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.070> HTC

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
company also it is just below the HTC

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.550 
company also it is just below the HTC
One<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.909> galaxy<00:01:55.479> s4<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.409> get

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
One and the galaxy s4 so you get

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.649 
One and the galaxy s4 so you get
flagship<00:01:57.159> performance<00:01:57.640> even<00:01:58.390> though<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.570> has

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
flagship performance even though it has

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.320 
flagship performance even though it has
a<00:01:58.720> dual<00:01:58.960> core<00:01:59.200> processor<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:01.000> now<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.210> are

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
a dual core processor so now we are

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.630 
a dual core processor so now we are
running<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.690> quadrant<00:02:02.080> benchmark<00:02:02.640> let's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
running the quadrant benchmark let's

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.950 
running the quadrant benchmark let's
submit<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.090> score<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.479> get<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> comparison

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
submit the score to get a comparison

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.310 
submit the score to get a comparison
chart<00:02:05.410> pooing<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.509> got<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.690> score<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.080> 8<00:02:08.259> to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
chart pooing so you got a score of 8 to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.300 
chart pooing so you got a score of 8 to
80<00:02:08.709> which<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.700> again<00:02:10.149> quite<00:02:10.479> close<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
80 which is again quite close to the

80 which is again quite close to the
Nexus<00:02:12.670> 5<00:02:13.110> now<00:02:14.110> we<00:02:14.170> will<00:02:14.350> run<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> knee<00:02:14.950> nama<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
Nexus 5 now we will run the knee nama to

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.070 
Nexus 5 now we will run the knee nama to
benchmark<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> will<00:02:16.270> test<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.660> graphics

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
benchmark it will test a graphics

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.130

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
promise of the Adreno 320 GPU we got a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.130

now<00:02:26.980> we<00:02:27.040> will<00:02:27.190> run<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.370> single<00:02:27.790> thread

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
now we will run the single thread

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.300 
now we will run the single thread
benchmark<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.810> lint<00:02:29.290> back<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.769> got<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> score<00:02:30.160> of
