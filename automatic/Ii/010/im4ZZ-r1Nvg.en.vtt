00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
water is being directed from where it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.910 
water is being directed from where it
was<00:00:34.130> directed<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:34.970> food<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:36.680> take<00:00:36.890> a

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
was directed to this food so we take a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:58.599 
was directed to this food so we take a
journey

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.340 

well<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.910> blocking<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> water<00:01:01.019> but<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
well I'm blocking out the water but the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.259 
well I'm blocking out the water but the
water<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.739> blocking<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.699> river<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
water I'm blocking is not the river it

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.600 
water I'm blocking is not the river it
is<00:01:03.510> hot<00:01:04.439> water

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
is hot water

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.500 
is hot water
the<00:01:07.210> hot<00:01:07.480> water<00:01:07.780> spring<00:01:08.230> is<00:01:08.350> coming<00:01:08.500> up<00:01:08.800> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the hot water spring is coming up I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:20.420 
the hot water spring is coming up I
build<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.630> dime<00:01:10.840> around<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:13.030> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.270 

but<00:01:20.910> uh

understood the process and the first
thing<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.090> did<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> introduce<00:02:33.670> me<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.390> deep

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
thing we did was to introduce me to deep

villages<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.220> Judah<00:02:59.720> why<00:03:00.720> are<00:03:01.170> they<00:03:01.410> so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
villages in Judah why are they so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.790 
villages in Judah why are they so
important<00:03:02.220> well<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:04.940> water<00:03:05.940> again<00:03:06.800> is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
important well because water again is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.980 
important well because water again is
what<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.520> made<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:09.230> 78%<00:03:12.020> liquid<00:03:13.020> fluid<00:03:14.990> so
