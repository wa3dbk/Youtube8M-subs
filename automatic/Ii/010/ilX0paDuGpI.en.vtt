00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.400

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 and this here is 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.819
 well I do not know what Wednesday is but 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.799
 then I'm going to review 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 It's very beautiful I really like it 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.120
 very very pretty 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 in buying more than everything because I 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.010
 I play a television that is very big 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.959
 my eyes burn a lot if you play a lot 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 and there is a moment that tires your eyes 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.260
 that your eyes get tired and 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.390
 it is very uncomfortable to play like this 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.299
 so that's why I bought this and apart 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.470
 that you also can not see your 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.420
 enemies does not differentiate us well 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.299
 then the professionals for example 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.019
 they play like with this type of TV 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.560
 I think they are 24 inches 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.680
 of 23-2 getting 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.690
 so that's why I decided nothing more gentlemen 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.830
 I hope you like it, let's try it 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.379
 after 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.090
 and let's connect everything I want to try it 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.250
 I want to see how 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.700
 nothing more gentlemen this is all a hug 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.980
 for all the gamers in the world 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.980
 and until the next goodbye
