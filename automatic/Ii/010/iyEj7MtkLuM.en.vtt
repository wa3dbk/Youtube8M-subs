00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
really really soft and elastic so it's

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
really really soft and elastic so it's
going<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.799> give<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.250> really<00:01:25.020> snug<00:01:26.020> comfortable

seal to the face and then equalizing

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.690 
seal to the face and then equalizing
it's<00:01:47.439> going<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.619> be<00:01:47.710> really<00:01:48.040> comfortable<00:01:48.340> and
