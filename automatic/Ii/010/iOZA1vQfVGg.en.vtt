00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello in this video I present you a 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.249
 simple connection diagram of a 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.170
 alternator brand never without skin with 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:12.350
 electronic voltage regulator 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.970
 universal good will begin by indicating 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.039
 what are the connections of a 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.530
 regulator as we see in the picture 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.800
 we have a couple of these regulators of 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.570
 different brands and they are very similar 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.090
 we noticed that they have a marked connector 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.550
 with the letters ign referring to 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.130
 ignition and other marked with camps 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.079
 o field that is the same in the first 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.269
 diagram we see that the tab of the 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.670
 regulator indicated with field goes to 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.899
 alternator and connects to the flat tab 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.899
 that here we see indicated 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.540
 Now going back to the diagram and 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.570
 regulator we see that the tab marked with 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.850
 ign or start is connected to the positive 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.070
 of the coil this is done so that at 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.290
 turn on the engine to supply power 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.290
 also to the regulator so that this 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.720
 exists to the alternator we continue with the 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.009
 alternator and we see a cable coming 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.410
 of the battery 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.000
 this cable is always thick and even more 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.420
 depending on the capacity of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.670
 alternator well now we see highlighted 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.010
 with a circumference the terminal of 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.470
 alternator to which it is connected 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.480
 to finish a recommendation that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.940
 do the makers of regulators is 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.190
 place a ground or earth cable as 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.990
 you call him directly between the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.870
 voltage regulator and alternator 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.730
 as it was expressed in the figure this 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.340
 cable can go anywhere in the 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.460
 alternator body either as a frame in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 this image or where they are best and in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 the regulator should fix it to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.490
 fastenings that in some cases already 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.630
 they are marked with the mass symbol 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.399
 I was forgetting an important part 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.009
 to control the load my preference 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.380
 is to place a digital voltmeter because 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.420
 they are more accurate , easy to read and do not 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.509
 They differ a lot in price from needle 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.549
 the placement is simple we connect the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.549
 negative to massa and the positive to 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.489
 contact the values ​​should be of 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.560
 between 13 to 14 4 volts maximum 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.269
 depending on the revolutions of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 engine and the internal adjustments of 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.910
 regulator now with the engine off the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.630
 Ideal indicated voltage would be between 12 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.190
 5 to 12 8 volts and this would indicate us 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.610
 a battery in good condition and good 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.200
 loaded eye is said that ideal or 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390
 this does not mean that your vehicles 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.459
 they are not going to start or the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.100
 battery because they have a few tenths less 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.130
 of volts would be much explaining possible 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.380
 variables if you want to download the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.290
 illustrations go to the links that 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.470
 I leave you lucky in yours and even the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.470
 next
