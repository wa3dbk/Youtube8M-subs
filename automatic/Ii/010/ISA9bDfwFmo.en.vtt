00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
obviously the parable aspect of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
obviously the parable aspect of the
episode<00:00:44.490> was<00:00:44.640> pretty<00:00:44.910> heavy-handed<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.690> was

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
episode was pretty heavy-handed it was

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.060 
episode was pretty heavy-handed it was
just<00:00:45.930> meant<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> teach<00:00:46.260> Korra<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.770> giving

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
just meant to teach Korra that giving

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.500 
just meant to teach Korra that giving
off<00:00:47.190> bad<00:00:47.400> vibes<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> spirit<00:00:48.420> world

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
off bad vibes in the spirit world

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
off bad vibes in the spirit world
basically<00:00:49.110> turns<00:00:49.320> regular<00:00:49.740> spirits<00:00:50.070> into

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
basically turns regular spirits into

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
basically turns regular spirits into
evil<00:00:50.520> spirits<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.270> guessing<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
evil spirits so I'm guessing that that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.510 
evil spirits so I'm guessing that that
means<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.200> whenever<00:00:52.530> she<00:00:52.829> fights<00:00:53.130> against

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
means that whenever she fights against

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.710 
means that whenever she fights against
vaatu<00:00:53.820> she's<00:00:54.060> going<00:00:54.240> to<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.450> give<00:00:54.630> off

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
vaatu she's going to have to give off

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.290 
vaatu she's going to have to give off
some<00:00:54.900> sort<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> nuclear<00:00:55.620> mega<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.430> vibe<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.970> do

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
some sort of nuclear mega good vibe I do

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
some sort of nuclear mega good vibe I do
have<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.660> few<00:00:57.840> complaints<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.350> baby<00:00:58.710> Korra

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
have a few complaints about baby Korra

have a few complaints about baby Korra
but<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.310> talk<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.790> during<00:01:00.030> my

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
but I'll talk about that during my

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.640 
but I'll talk about that during my
review<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.840> number<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.170> favorite<00:01:01.470> thing

this point and upside-down tree house
library<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> still<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.579> fun<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
library but it was still really fun to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.310 
library but it was still really fun to
see<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> again<00:01:09.329> they<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:10.020> him<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
see it again they didn't use him in a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.210 
see it again they didn't use him in a
really<00:01:10.440> big<00:01:10.620> way<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.100> really

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
really big way and I was really

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
really big way and I was really
surprised<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.820> him<00:01:12.090> double-cross<00:01:12.570> Jinora

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
surprised to see him double-cross Jinora

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
surprised to see him double-cross Jinora
like<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:13.860> said<00:01:14.070> unlock<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
like that but when he said unlock is a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
like that but when he said unlock is a
true<00:01:14.940> friend<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> spirits<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.080> he

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
true friend of the spirits I think he

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.240 
true friend of the spirits I think he
kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> gave<00:01:16.500> away<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:17.010> bit<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
kind of gave away a little bit of the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
kind of gave away a little bit of the
plot<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.000> vaatu<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.630> trying

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
plot I think that vaatu is just trying

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.360 
plot I think that vaatu is just trying
to<00:01:18.840> take<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> normal<00:01:19.680> realm<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.010> the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
to take over the normal realm and the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.890 
to take over the normal realm and the
spirit<00:01:20.670> realm<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> spirits<00:01:21.630> would<00:01:21.720> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
spirit realm so the spirits would just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
spirit realm so the spirits would just
pass<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.380> into<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> normal<00:01:23.130> realm<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pass back into the normal realm but they

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
pass back into the normal realm but they
were<00:01:23.640> during<00:01:23.940> wands<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.960> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
were during wands time it's so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
were during wands time it's so
unfortunate<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.740> he<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.220> grossly

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
unfortunate that he is so grossly

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.820 
unfortunate that he is so grossly
misinformed<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:28.170> tiny<00:01:28.409> men<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
misinformed about little tiny men and

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.649 
misinformed about little tiny men and
radios<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.580> overall<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> visual<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.510> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
radios but overall the visual look of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
radios but overall the visual look of
the<00:01:30.780> spirit<00:01:31.080> world<00:01:31.260> was<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.710> interesting

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the spirit world was really interesting

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.500 
the spirit world was really interesting
let's<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> quick<00:01:32.760> poll<00:01:32.909> who<00:01:33.180> liked<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
let's take a quick poll who liked the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.700 
let's take a quick poll who liked the
spirit<00:01:33.780> world<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.290> depicted

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
spirit world the way it was depicted

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
spirit world the way it was depicted
more<00:01:35.010> during<00:01:35.460> Aang's<00:01:35.729> time<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.240> who<00:01:36.780> liked

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
more during Aang's time and who liked

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
more during Aang's time and who liked
the<00:01:37.049> spirit<00:01:37.409> world<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.830> there<00:01:38.310> were<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> few

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the spirit world now there were a few

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.830 
the spirit world now there were a few
complaints<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> spirit<00:01:39.540> world<00:01:39.659> just

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
complaints that the spirit world just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
complaints that the spirit world just
seemed<00:01:39.990> too<00:01:40.170> bright<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> shiny<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> think

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
seemed too bright and shiny but I think

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.039 
seemed too bright and shiny but I think
that's<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.119> consequence<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.900> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that's just a consequence of the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.630 
that's just a consequence of the
animation<00:01:43.500> studio<00:01:43.799> changing<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.460> little

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
animation studio changing just a little

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
animation studio changing just a little
bit<00:01:44.760> obviously<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.330> studio<00:01:45.600> mirrors<00:01:45.869> back

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
bit obviously the studio mirrors back

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.480 
bit obviously the studio mirrors back
but<00:01:46.260> Legend<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> Korra<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.159> different

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
but Legend of Korra has a very different

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.070 
but Legend of Korra has a very different
animation<00:01:47.909> style<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.450> avatar<00:01:48.659> last

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
animation style than avatar last

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.440 
animation style than avatar last
airbender<00:01:49.260> had<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.159> love<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> 3d<00:01:50.970> animation

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
airbender had I do love the 3d animation

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
airbender had I do love the 3d animation
effects<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.900> have<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> episode<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
effects that they have in the episode it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.170 
effects that they have in the episode it
kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.920> gives<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> camera<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.729> panning

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
kind of gives the camera this panning

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.000 
kind of gives the camera this panning
effect<00:01:54.479> especially<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:55.409> Jinora<00:01:55.799> was

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
effect especially like when Jinora was

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.590 
effect especially like when Jinora was
reading<00:01:56.369> from<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> book<00:01:56.760> but<00:01:57.180> high<00:01:57.420> five

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
reading from the book but high five

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
reading from the book but high five
yourself<00:01:57.900> if<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.560> guess<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.890> unalaq<00:01:59.400> was

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
yourself if you guess that unalaq was

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
yourself if you guess that unalaq was
gonna<00:01:59.700> use<00:01:59.939> Jinora<00:02:00.330> -<00:02:00.570> blackmail<00:02:00.840> Korra<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
gonna use Jinora - blackmail Korra I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.810 
gonna use Jinora - blackmail Korra I
think<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> lot<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> people<00:02:02.490> kind<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.670> assume

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
think a lot of people kind of assume

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
think a lot of people kind of assume
this<00:02:03.119> because<00:02:03.450> otherwise<00:02:03.780> how<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.320> he<00:02:04.409> going

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this because otherwise how is he going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.899 
this because otherwise how is he going
to<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.890> portal<00:02:05.220> open<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.729> like

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to get that portal open it's not like

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370 
to get that portal open it's not like
Korra<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.780> him<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.080> based

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
Korra was gonna do it for him and based

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.719 
Korra was gonna do it for him and based
on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> fact<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> knew<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.310> title<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
on the fact that we knew the title of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.009 
on the fact that we knew the title of
one<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> next<00:02:09.239> episodes<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.689> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> be

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
one of the next episodes is going to be

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.570 
one of the next episodes is going to be
harmonic<00:02:10.530> convergence<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.159> think<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.459> could

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
harmonic convergence I think we could

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.860 
harmonic convergence I think we could
just<00:02:11.700> assume<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.299> was<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> happen

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
just assume that it was going to happen

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.030 
just assume that it was going to happen
anyway<00:02:13.080> we're<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.829> period

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
anyway we're actually in that period

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.440 
anyway we're actually in that period
when<00:02:14.219> we<00:02:14.249> really<00:02:14.579> only<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.879> two<00:02:15.120> more<00:02:15.269> weeks

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
when we really only have two more weeks

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.059 
when we really only have two more weeks
of<00:02:15.569> Legend<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> Korra<00:02:16.079> but<00:02:16.439> both<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.769> those

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
of Legend of Korra but both of those

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.830 
of Legend of Korra but both of those
weeks<00:02:17.400> are<00:02:17.639> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.849> be<00:02:17.909> hour-long<00:02:18.269> episodes

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
weeks are going to be hour-long episodes

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.520 
weeks are going to be hour-long episodes
be<00:02:19.260> sure<00:02:19.379> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
week we're gonna see harmonic

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.070 
week we're gonna see harmonic
convergence<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:24.959> what

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
convergence and the is on but what

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.930 
convergence and the is on but what
did<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> episode<00:02:25.680> overall<00:02:26.130> well

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
did I think of the episode overall well

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.550 
did I think of the episode overall well
I<00:02:26.970> give<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> solid<00:02:27.540> beep<00:02:27.900> mostly<00:02:28.410> just

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I give it a solid beep mostly just

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
I give it a solid beep mostly just
because<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.250> awesome<00:02:29.459> seeing<00:02:30.030> Iroh

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
because it was so awesome seeing Iroh

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.720 
because it was so awesome seeing Iroh
and<00:02:30.510> washi<00:02:31.020> Tong<00:02:31.380> again<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> was<00:02:32.520> not<00:02:32.700> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
and washi Tong again but I was not a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
and washi Tong again but I was not a
huge<00:02:33.120> fan<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.360> baby<00:02:33.660> Korra<00:02:33.990> like<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.440> said<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
huge fan of baby Korra like I said it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.930 
huge fan of baby Korra like I said it
was<00:02:34.770> basically<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.250> parable<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.850> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
was basically just a parable just to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.400 
was basically just a parable just to
teach<00:02:36.090> Korra<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.600> value<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.050> giving<00:02:37.140> off

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
teach Korra the value of giving off

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.260 
teach Korra the value of giving off
positive<00:02:37.950> vibes<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.489> spirit<00:02:38.819> world<00:02:38.910> or

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
positive vibes in the spirit world or

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.820 
positive vibes in the spirit world or
the<00:02:39.390> consequence<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.959> giving<00:02:40.230> negative<00:02:40.380> vibes

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
the consequence of giving negative vibes

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.240 
the consequence of giving negative vibes
off

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
off

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.380 
off
I<00:02:41.280> feel<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.640> IRA<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.239> just

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
I feel like IRA could have just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.610 
I feel like IRA could have just
explained<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.870> her<00:02:43.050> with<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.380> two

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
explained it to her with about two

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
explained it to her with about two
sentences<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> audience<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.270> Korra

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
sentences and we the audience and Korra

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.910 
sentences and we the audience and Korra
would<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.780> totally<00:02:46.050> understood<00:02:46.440> they've

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
would have totally understood they've

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.290 
would have totally understood they've
actually<00:02:47.069> been<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> couple<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.670> episodes<00:02:47.819> this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
actually been a couple of episodes this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.520 
actually been a couple of episodes this
season<00:02:48.360> where<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.870> felt<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.290> there<00:02:49.380> was

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
season where it felt like there was

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
season where it felt like there was
maybe<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.950> two<00:02:50.190> or<00:02:50.310> three<00:02:50.520> minutes<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
maybe like two or three minutes of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.460 
maybe like two or three minutes of
actual<00:02:51.360> plot<00:02:51.630> development<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.260> like

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
actual plot development and like

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.020 
actual plot development and like
eighteen<00:02:52.769> minutes<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.130> filler<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
eighteen minutes of filler but like I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.100 
eighteen minutes of filler but like I
said<00:02:54.090> we're<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.480> last<00:02:54.660> couple<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.050> weeks

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
said we're in the last couple of weeks

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570 
said we're in the last couple of weeks
so<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.530> basically<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:55.920> gonna<00:02:56.070> barrel<00:02:56.459> down

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
so it's basically just gonna barrel down

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.009 
so it's basically just gonna barrel down
the<00:02:56.760> plot<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.300> think<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.630> will<00:02:57.750> answer<00:02:57.900> a

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
the plot but I think that will answer a

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.509 
the plot but I think that will answer a
lot<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.260> concerns<00:02:58.530> about<00:02:58.620> story<00:02:59.010> progression

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
lot of concerns about story progression

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.370 
lot of concerns about story progression
so<00:02:59.820> next<00:03:00.090> week<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.510> first<00:03:00.660> episode<00:03:01.140> will<00:03:01.350> be

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
so next week the first episode will be

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.840 
so next week the first episode will be
night<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.860> thousand<00:03:02.220> stars<00:03:02.280> than<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
night of a thousand stars than the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.250 
night of a thousand stars than the
second<00:03:03.180> episode<00:03:03.510> will<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:03.690> harmonic

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
second episode will be harmonic

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.600 
second episode will be harmonic
convergence<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> week<00:03:05.310> after<00:03:05.430> that

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
convergence then the week after that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.520 
convergence then the week after that
will<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.239> two-part<00:03:06.720> finale<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:07.350> there's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
will be the two-part finale if there's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.780 
will be the two-part finale if there's
anything<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.040> didn't<00:03:08.250> mention<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.700> video
