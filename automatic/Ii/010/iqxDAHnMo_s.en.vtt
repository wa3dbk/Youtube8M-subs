00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.270
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.360
 I have a set of thresholds for me 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.300
 Hyundai Ay X 35 Sometimes pretty 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.710
 interesting I have not had such 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.720
 met both in form and in quality 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.720
 making appearance here on the icon 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.029
 ix35 base material 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:32.320
 we have thick plastic 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:36.540
 well, at a glance somewhere around three 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.880
 half four millimeters on top goes 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.950
 aluminum plate aluminum sheet 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:54.070
 perforated quite beautiful so he 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:55.329
 made squeezed with a lift let's 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.050
 I will reverse the effect that the reverse 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.879
 hand here you can see that he put on 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 machine filming full-time plastic 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.499
 bottom is put on the same places here they are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.319
 where do the clips go? 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:14.409
 plus everything can be seen that the metal 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:15.840
 the sheet is this 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 just for beauty 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.479
 that is, here it is bolted and fastened to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.429
 these places we have brackets attached 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.679
 that go in the set and in fact there 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.599
 metal brackets which are 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.490
 go to the body and when we step on 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:37.539
 aluminum sheet we are essentially stepping on 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.719
 the brackets are all made very high quality 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.119
 and I think the fit and everything is here 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.459
 chotenko should be as it should be here at 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.819
 us even 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:53.259
 factory for fluff written right threshold 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.630
 when the date is made very well beautiful 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.369
 look 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.419
 material with black plastic okay said 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.419
 a little shagreen 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.610
 in the complete set here such here fasteners are more true 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.380
 box with fasteners box is quite heavy 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.940
 but I think so kilogram well not to 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.530
 lie to 8 may no longer disclose 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 I will print because 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.350
 I want him to lie down with me 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.070
 it is always print then rolls on 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.260
 shelves if someone wants these 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.880
 I will undoubtedly print the thresholds 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.230
 video show how it looks there in 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.940
 set must be 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.940
 instruction nuts and bolts hardware 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.220
 all you need to install again 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.960
 I will say that it is quite heavy, that is 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.270
 metal pipe brackets in a set 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.840
 surely transparent in order that you can 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.730
 It was on them to approach the thresholds go left 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.500
 the right ones are both perfect to paint 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.680
 take only put on the car yes and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 all if we proceed from what and sometimes 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.950
 and held in the hands of the same firm on Kia 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 sportazh 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.520
 on sorrento that is, everything is exactly there 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.680
 Blueberries are also made with high quality 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.510
 car becomes 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.370
 well actually that's all at the end 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.380
 I will try to add a couple of pictures as they 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.010
 look at the car if I find where there 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.350
 there were no catalog pictures 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.830
 I hope the video was interesting at 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.980
 least showed what I did not see before 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.959
 everything 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.110
 if you have questions ask in 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.350
 comments of this meeting on u tube
