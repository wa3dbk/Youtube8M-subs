completely<00:00:54.420> transformed<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:55.170> foundation<00:00:55.800> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
completely transformed my foundation if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.889 
completely transformed my foundation if
you've<00:00:56.309> never<00:00:56.489> tried<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> product<00:00:57.660> like

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you've never tried out a product like

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
you've never tried out a product like
this<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.559> definitely<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> give<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this you definitely need to give it a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.299 
this you definitely need to give it a
shot<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.750> 1995<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
shot but for 1995 I think it's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
shot but for 1995 I think it's
ridiculous<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ridiculous because it's not like a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
ridiculous because it's not like a
makeup<00:01:04.290> brush<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.830> last<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
makeup brush that's gonna last you a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
makeup brush that's gonna last you a
couple<00:01:05.580> years<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.100> gonna

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
couple years or more this is like gonna

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.390 
couple years or more this is like gonna
last<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.970> six<00:01:09.540> months<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:11.250> use

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
last you six months maybe I probably use

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
last you six months maybe I probably use
mine<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> tad<00:01:12.150> longer<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.110> you're

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
mine a tad longer and then you're

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
mine a tad longer and then you're
technically<00:01:13.680> supposed<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.640> I've<00:01:15.000> never

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
technically supposed to but I've never

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
technically supposed to but I've never
broken<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.259> using<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> too<00:01:16.799> long

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
broken out from using it too long

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
broken out from using it too long
generally<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.939> kept<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.240> last<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.659> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
generally I think I kept my last one for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
generally I think I kept my last one for
like<00:01:18.960> six<00:01:19.860> months<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.939> using<00:01:21.150> it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
as you can see than this but see how big

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940 
as you can see than this but see how big

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
this one is not and I'm squeezing it in

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.860 
this one is not and I'm squeezing it in
the<00:02:46.660> center<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.440> very<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:49.660> I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the center it's like very like if I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.970 
the center it's like very like if I
squeeze<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.650> could<00:02:50.740> pretty<00:02:50.890> much

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
squeeze this you could pretty much

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.800 
squeeze this you could pretty much
squeeze<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.490> flat<00:02:51.670> if<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:51.970> squeeze<00:02:52.240> this<00:02:52.450> it's

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
squeeze it flat if I squeeze this it's

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.070 
squeeze it flat if I squeeze this it's
like<00:02:53.430> not<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.460> huge<00:02:54.910> difference<00:02:55.240> just<00:02:55.840> think

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
like not a huge difference just think

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720 
like not a huge difference just think

like you know those sponge wedges you

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.280 
like you know those sponge wedges you
could<00:02:57.880> buy<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.330> apply<00:02:58.510> your<00:02:58.660> foundation<00:02:58.780> like

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
could buy to apply your foundation like

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.380 
could buy to apply your foundation like
the<00:02:59.410> really<00:02:59.620> old<00:02:59.650> school<00:03:00.010> ones<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:01.090> is

than the Beauty Blender it is bigger

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.850 
than the Beauty Blender it is bigger
slightly<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.300> actually<00:03:31.510> like<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.470> flat

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
slightly and I actually like this flat

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.949 
slightly and I actually like this flat
side<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.430> really<00:03:33.700> nice<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.150> kind<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.510> applies

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
side it's really nice it kind of applies

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.100 
side it's really nice it kind of applies
it<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.470> larger<00:03:36.250> area<00:03:36.490> than<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.570> bottom<00:03:37.750> of

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
it to a larger area than the bottom of

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.750 
it to a larger area than the bottom of
the<00:03:38.410> Beauty<00:03:38.680> Blender<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> could<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.730> your

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the Beauty Blender so you could do your

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.540 
the Beauty Blender so you could do your
whole<00:03:40.090> face<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.540> lot<00:03:40.840> faster<00:03:41.530> with<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.100> is

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
whole face a lot faster with this it is

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.000 
whole face a lot faster with this it is
just<00:03:42.970> as<00:03:43.180> squishy<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.620> they're<00:03:44.770> about
