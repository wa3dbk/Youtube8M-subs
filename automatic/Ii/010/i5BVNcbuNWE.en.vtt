device yeah and you can still use the
workbench<00:01:07.330> software<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:08.020> create<00:01:08.320> your<00:01:08.560> own

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
workbench software to create your own

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.650 
workbench software to create your own
guitars<00:01:09.060> absolutely<00:01:10.060> it's<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.270> exact<00:01:10.630> same

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
guitars absolutely it's the exact same

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.840 
guitars absolutely it's the exact same
software<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.530> if<00:01:12.010> you're<00:01:12.250> used<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.730> way

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
software so if you're used to the way

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.150 
software so if you're used to the way
the<00:01:13.000> James<00:01:13.180> Fowler<00:01:13.450> Variax<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.950> maybe

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
the James Fowler Variax is and maybe

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.770 
the James Fowler Variax is and maybe
you've<00:01:15.310> even<00:01:15.430> programmed<00:01:16.030> one<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.390> your<00:01:16.480> units

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
you've even programmed one of your units

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.300 
you've even programmed one of your units
to<00:01:16.900> control<00:01:17.170> your<00:01:17.320> barracks<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.830> can

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
to control your barracks you can

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.590 
to control your barracks you can
actually<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:18.730> plug<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.540> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
actually just plug this in and it's a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.940 
actually just plug this in and it's a
plug<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:19.930> play<00:01:20.110> everything's<00:01:20.560> gonna<00:01:20.740> be

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
plug and play everything's gonna be

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.220 
plug and play everything's gonna be
exactly<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.490> way<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.790> expect<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.540> now

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
exactly the way you expect it to be now

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.690 
exactly the way you expect it to be now
the<00:01:23.290> big<00:01:23.500> difference<00:01:23.530> between<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.370> and<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
the big difference between this and the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.460 
the big difference between this and the
very<00:01:24.910> early<00:01:25.360> very<00:01:25.510> access<00:01:25.990> first<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.320> all<00:01:26.380> you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
very early very access first of all you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.930 
very early very access first of all you
have<00:01:26.590> your<00:01:26.710> regular<00:01:26.890> guitar<00:01:27.370> pickups<00:01:27.790> which

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
have your regular guitar pickups which

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.240 
have your regular guitar pickups which
you<00:01:28.060> can<00:01:28.210> use<00:01:28.420> but<00:01:28.960> also<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.680> works<00:01:29.890> from<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
you can use but also it now works from a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.770 
you can use but also it now works from a
rechargeable<00:01:31.060> camera<00:01:31.330> button<00:01:31.570> camera

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
rechargeable camera button camera

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.380 
rechargeable camera button camera
battery<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.200> believe<00:01:32.440> exactly<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.640> right<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
battery I believe exactly so right the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.970 
battery I believe exactly so right the
magnetic<00:01:34.840> pickups<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.290> was<00:01:35.410> a<00:01:35.440> big<00:01:35.710> thing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
magnetic pickups that was a big thing

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.130 
magnetic pickups that was a big thing
but<00:01:36.370> turning<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.120> around<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.630> just<00:01:37.660> taking<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
but turning it around and just taking a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.620 
but turning it around and just taking a
look<00:01:38.260> right<00:01:38.530> here<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.480> have<00:01:40.600> a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
look right here we actually have a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.330 
look right here we actually have a
lithium-ion<00:01:41.260> battery<00:01:41.440> that's<00:01:42.010> gonna<00:01:42.130> give

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
lithium-ion battery that's gonna give

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.010 
lithium-ion battery that's gonna give
you<00:01:42.430> 12<00:01:42.790> hours<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.600> example<00:01:43.990> just

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
you 12 hours so for example just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.810 
you 12 hours so for example just
touching<00:01:44.620> that<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:45.010> say<00:01:45.160> oh<00:01:45.190> okay<00:01:45.610> well

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
touching that I can say oh okay well

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.570 
touching that I can say oh okay well
each<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.360> these<00:01:46.480> is<00:01:46.660> worth<00:01:47.010> three<00:01:48.010> hours<00:01:48.370> so<00:01:48.520> I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
each of these is worth three hours so I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.850 
each of these is worth three hours so I
know<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.090> I've<00:01:49.180> got<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.600> nine<00:01:50.140> hours<00:01:50.470> left<00:01:50.740> for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
know that I've got a nine hours left for

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.040 
know that I've got a nine hours left for
example<00:01:51.400> so<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.910> even<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.360> pull<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.810> out

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
example so so even if you pull this out

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.630 
example so so even if you pull this out
it<00:01:53.680> has<00:01:53.890> no<00:01:54.130> power

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
it has no power

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.000 
it has no power
you<00:01:55.090> still<00:01:55.390> get<00:01:55.600> sound<00:01:55.900> if<00:01:56.290> you're<00:01:56.530> gonna<00:01:56.770> be

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
you still get sound if you're gonna be

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.840 
you still get sound if you're gonna be
connected<00:01:57.310> by<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.840> hot<00:01:58.840> HD<00:01:59.230> or<00:01:59.320> Firehawk<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.490> if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
connected by a hot HD or Firehawk but if

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.790 
connected by a hot HD or Firehawk but if
not<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.330> know<00:02:01.420> all<00:02:01.720> else<00:02:01.930> fails<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.590> still

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
not you know all else fails you still

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.170 
not you know all else fails you still
just<00:02:02.920> got<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.100> great<00:02:03.340> feeling<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.910> playing

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
just got a great feeling and playing

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.640 
just got a great feeling and playing
guitar<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.930> get<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.200> through<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.470> gig

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
guitar that can get you through the gig

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770 
guitar that can get you through the gig
yes<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.070> have<00:02:06.250> been<00:02:06.430> told<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.790> if<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.450> have<00:02:07.600> no

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
yes I have been told that if you have no

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.990 
yes I have been told that if you have no
battery<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.340> magnetic<00:02:09.340> pickups<00:02:09.610> still<00:02:09.789> work

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
battery the magnetic pickups still work

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.309 
battery the magnetic pickups still work
there's<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.269> relay<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.719> drops<00:02:10.929> out<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
there's a relay that drops out the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.680 
there's a relay that drops out the
electronic<00:02:12.129> circuitry<00:02:12.549> correct<00:02:13.269> yes

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
electronic circuitry correct yes

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.480 
electronic circuitry correct yes
so<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.080> happens<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.890> wouldn't<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.370> we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
so what happens is you wouldn't when we

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.300 
so what happens is you wouldn't when we
activate<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:17.710> switches<00:02:18.160> it

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
activate this this is what switches it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
activate this this is what switches it
between<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.030> magnetic<00:02:19.390> pickups<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.200> PI

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
between the magnetic pickups and the PI

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.930 
between the magnetic pickups and the PI
is<00:02:20.470> affixed<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.160> bridge<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.580> that's<00:02:21.730> what

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
is affixed on the bridge and that's what

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.550 
is affixed on the bridge and that's what
actually<00:02:22.090> sends<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.110> once<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.410> turn

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
actually sends it so so once you turn

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
actually sends it so so once you turn
that<00:02:23.740> off<00:02:23.800> yeah<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.550> you're<00:02:24.730> not<00:02:24.760> going

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that off yeah it's not you're not going

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
that off yeah it's not you're not going
to<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.150> drawn<00:02:25.420> from<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.810> battery<00:02:25.840> yeah<00:02:26.380> so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
to be drawn from the battery yeah so

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.810 
to be drawn from the battery yeah so
that's<00:02:26.830> pretty<00:02:26.950> good<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.250> battery<00:02:27.490> life<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
that's pretty good on battery life and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.730 
that's pretty good on battery life and
it's<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.060> really<00:02:28.270> smart<00:02:28.600> finish<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:29.650> a

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
it's a really smart finish that's a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's a really smart finish that's a
really<00:02:29.920> nice<00:02:30.040> sunburst<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> also<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.120> it
