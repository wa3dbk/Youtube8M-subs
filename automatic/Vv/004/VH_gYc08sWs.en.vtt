00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.019
 I always wanted to have a bus have 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 even a part or the bigger one 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.370
 Part of the vehicles next to motorcycle and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.860
 trabant and one and for me is one of the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.170
 somehow still at the end with this is also 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.930
 a piece of childhood memory about the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.510
 time was then or came many questions 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.980
 on what is going on in 4-stroke engine with 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 his funny plate in between 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.500
 body that is not consistent with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.199
 fiat acta the engine tunnel larger than 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.179
 in possible four-stroke and posed 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.269
 It turns out that the body in 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.159
 vehicle work chub the vehicle one 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.530
 new body has received and that 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.670
 the one or the last is the 1990 there 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
 been clamped 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.789
 the vehicle do so much greater 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.339
 you have used here in the inner part to 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.309
 just this whole engine so in the art 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.829
 get it in, and so it does 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.820
 this combination of the tree in june 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.790
 it does not seem normal 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.840
 then when the engine has run and the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.220
 The decision was made 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.800
 im in the vehicle and again 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.360
 I have to construct back first 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.350
 made an inventory like again 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.580
 Maybe it is and it is 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.619
 found that all 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.270
 schwemmbauer the whole typical 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.860
 Bochumer carries the incident 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.900
 have been completely eliminated these too 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.420
 carrying construction of the ladder 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.160
 were not in order were so immense 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.540
 a lot of sweat work means you see 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.759
 that's so nice to these 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
 rust protection following parts are like in the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.360
 the final result all been replaced 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.610
 the whole sills and down the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.070
 ground group the axle suspension are new 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.810
 been fed 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.320
 and the whole vehicle is from below 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.729
 sandblasted were so right one 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.619
 basis were restored that it 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.240
 just hold a boredom can be 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.979
 not just made pretty fast 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.979
 but basically link 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.940
 For this site I had new ones 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.240
 Find finds from old car masters 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.400
 i got to create another one 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.440
 still get by chance and have this 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.730
 so to speak below the bad area 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.510
 have to cut out and always 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.510
 fed
