right<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.959> connect<00:02:22.380> those<00:02:22.560> two<00:02:22.830> marks<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
right then connect those two marks and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:41.640 
right then connect those two marks and
line<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> boards<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> tapering<00:02:25.170> jig

same<00:02:42.280> process<00:02:42.549> for<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.000> back<00:02:43.060> legs

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.949 

remember<00:03:07.640> those<00:03:07.760> back<00:03:08.000> slats<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.569> clamps

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
remember those back slats and clamps

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.920 
remember those back slats and clamps
those<00:03:09.890> are<00:03:10.099> dry<00:03:10.280> let's<00:03:10.879> take<00:03:11.090> them<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.329> rip

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
those are dry let's take them out rip

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.050 
those are dry let's take them out rip
them<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> width<00:03:12.379> on<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.620> table<00:03:12.890> saw<00:03:15.819> I'll<00:03:16.819> get

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
them the width on the table saw I'll get

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.849 
them the width on the table saw I'll get
three<00:03:17.329> back<00:03:17.540> slats<00:03:17.870> out<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.230> each<00:03:18.439> of<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.739> two

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
three back slats out of each of the two

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.130 
three back slats out of each of the two
glue<00:03:19.129> ups<00:03:19.340> about<00:03:20.060> two<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.629> quarter<00:03:20.780> inches

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
glue ups about two and a quarter inches

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.770 
glue ups about two and a quarter inches
wide<00:03:21.349> I'll<00:03:21.709> rip<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.549> last<00:03:22.760> one<00:03:23.030> out<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.480> 1<00:03:23.629> by

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
wide I'll rip the last one out of a 1 by

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.809 
wide I'll rip the last one out of a 1 by
4<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.620> offcut<00:03:25.099> piece<00:03:25.340> will<00:03:25.549> be<00:03:25.670> used

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
4 and the offcut piece will be used

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.970 
4 and the offcut piece will be used
later<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> project<00:03:26.720> I've<00:03:27.439> figured<00:03:27.739> this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
later in the project I've figured this

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.660 
later in the project I've figured this
all<00:03:28.189> out<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.700> have<00:03:28.849> very<00:03:29.180> little<00:03:29.390> waist

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.520 

I<00:03:36.730> forgot<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.660> railed<00:03:37.840> over<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.140> edges<00:03:38.500> of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
I forgot the railed over the edges of

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.410 
I forgot the railed over the edges of
the<00:03:38.740> arm<00:03:38.890> rests<00:03:39.400> when<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.640> round<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.060> over<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the arm rests when I round it over the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.930 
the arm rests when I round it over the
edges<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.050> seat<00:03:41.319> slats<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.430> I'll<00:03:42.700> do<00:03:42.880> that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
edges of the seat slats so I'll do that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:58.400 
edges of the seat slats so I'll do that
now<00:03:43.120> before<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.900> start<00:03:43.989> assembly

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.590 

I've<00:03:58.920> set<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.190> two<00:03:59.460> stop<00:03:59.760> blocks<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.390> drill

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
I've set up two stop blocks on the drill

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.050 
I've set up two stop blocks on the drill
press<00:04:00.630> because<00:04:01.230> these<00:04:02.010> screws<00:04:02.370> are<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:02.760> close

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
press because these screws are so close

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.210 
press because these screws are so close
to<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.360> edge<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.900> think<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.590> imperative<00:04:05.100> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
to the edge I think it's imperative to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.000 
to the edge I think it's imperative to
pre-drill<00:04:05.700> these<00:04:05.940> holes

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.550
