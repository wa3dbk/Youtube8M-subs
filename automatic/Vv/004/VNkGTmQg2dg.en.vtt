00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:22.950
 hello, santa, scroll 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 Dear Santa, thank you very much for 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.320
 this exclusive interview that in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.779
 rovaniemi in Lapland the whole project of mine 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 First of all, Santa can 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.390
 clarify one thing, you too are 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 called the lupo what it means and un 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.270
 puc is your real name 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.520
 the lupo that simply means daddy 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.219
 noel of finland call me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.109
 puc in many countries the so-called 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.359
 santa claus and many other names 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.219
 but you also can can choose me 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.640
 call it an eye because Santa's there 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.729
 how long you live there in Lapland 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.909
 very very long time like people 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:07.080
 they used to say many times 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:10.020
 many moons behind what is the circle 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.120
 polar and because your village is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.360
 located on the polar circle 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.729
 the arctic polar circle a mysterious 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.659
 magic line that travels across the globe 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 terrestrial 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.840
 here in Lapland above the polar circle 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 we have days in the summer when the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.690
 sun never sets the day always stays 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 illuminated days that lasted 24 hours 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.530
 and then in winter we have a few days in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.690
 that the sun never rises to mine 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 village is here because the polar circle 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.480
 Arctic is a very practical place because 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 here many roads and routes intersect 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.530
 Can you tell us about the position of the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 Santa's post office and Dad's village 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 Noel clear post office and here 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.790
 where are we is in this house a little 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 Santa's old village is all this 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.310
 around us I have my house soon 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.530
 in front of Santa's office and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.140
 that's when I get my visitors 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
 how many letters do you receive each year 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.739
 your post office 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.730
 It's worth a little bit more in recent years. 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:18.240
 receives between 500 and 700 thousand letters 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.080
 are many letters 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.830
 and from which countries do these letters 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.000
 world all around of 160 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.400
 countries last year if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.270
 how do you describe Lapland to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.410
 an independence country does not support 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.190
 no country 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.250
 the northernmost region of the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.940
 Finland and in fact this region further 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.740
 the whole of the European Union supports 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.710
 place where nature is truly 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.020
 Only here we have many seasons of the year. 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.980
 the various strong in the summer sun 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.680
 midnight in the immense snowy winter 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.240
 santa claus lord president the king of 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.210
 certainly not because we 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.770
 we do not have any river president of 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.050
 a part of Finland and in the 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.970
 Finland there is the president I let 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.410
 do your job and do only mine. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.740
 fan and people can visit it during 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.090
 every year in Rovaniemi to his hometown 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.810
 in finland 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.120
 of course you can see using any type 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.840
 transportation at any time and I 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.520
 to visit in my village in rovaniemi 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.400
 every day of the year 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.920
 Santa Claus where are your 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.450
 toy factories or mine. 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.670
 where we make all the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.190
 toys they are located at 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.590
 about 200 kilometers north of the cno 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.950
 secret place called the mountain of 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.840
 cÃ³rdoba thundorg where is my house 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.880
 all things are there but because 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.220
 all the christmas secrets are there no 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.780
 is open to the public and I can not 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.890
 invite you or anyone else 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.390
 to visit 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.430
 that's why here is a good place to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.930
 receive my visitors and the word 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.050
 tuto cup and some meaning 35 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.610
 cova tutor and cornea is the word 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.920
 Finnish for ear and mentoring 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.190
 the name comes from the fact that 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.400
 When you look at the mountain away she 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.150
 truth has two peaks the mountain if 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.490
 looks like two ears of one 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.960
 animal and that's why I can listen 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:39.430
 all the children in the world so well daddy 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.620
 No, how many reindeer do you have? 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.630
 a very difficult question because the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.729
 reindeer do not stop quiet 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.550
 the reindeer is basically a wild animal 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.000
 and they love to run in the woods and 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.330
 mountains but I would say that maybe 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.360
 as many scenes as there are stars in the 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.610
 sky if it is not a very cloudy night and 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.550
 your reindeer can fly 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.000
 Yes, of course they can, but she's just going. 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.470
 on Christmas Eve because it is necessary 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.300
 because we have to deliver to the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.069
 Gifts as you can 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.349
 distribute all Christmas presents 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.050
 for children from all over the world in 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.630
 only one day and one inem 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.729
 This is a difficult question before 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.130
 but nothing you have to keep in mind that 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.699
 I have extensive experience in this 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.370
 kind of work just like the elves and 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.830
 the reindeer and there is also a bit of 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.669
 magic involved in the delivery of gifts 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.229
 but here between me and you and do not tell 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.780
 for no one else 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.050
 I can reveal to you that we 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.759
 we take advantage of the time zones by 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.440
 For example, it's night here in Rovaniemi. 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.380
 but in another part of the world the children 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.409
 are just waking up in another part of the 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.139
 world are sleeping and elsewhere in the world. 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.780
 The world is at lunchtime and so on. 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.539
 apart from that, my scenes are taken 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.900
 use of time differences 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:11.380
 there are still other things some 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:15.370
 my scenes reveal the magic is 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:19.270
 present but the most important thing is 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.580
 that gifts are delivered on time 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.229
 Thank you very much, Santa. 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.870
