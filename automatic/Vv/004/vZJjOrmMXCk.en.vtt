use<00:01:57.590> your<00:01:57.860> filter<00:01:58.220> right<00:01:58.370> here<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.300> just<00:01:59.480> a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
use your filter right here and just a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.880 
use your filter right here and just a
small<00:01:59.750> piece<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.990> paper<00:02:00.170> towel<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.650> keeps

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
small piece of paper towel this keeps

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.590 
small piece of paper towel this keeps
any<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.220> bigger<00:02:01.400> chunks<00:02:01.760> out<00:02:01.880> but

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
any of the bigger chunks out but

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.000 
any of the bigger chunks out but
generally<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.080> won't<00:02:03.170> even<00:02:03.410> need<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> use<00:02:03.800> it

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
generally you won't even need to use it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.910 
generally you won't even need to use it
if<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.730> butter<00:02:05.480> clarified<00:02:06.020> well<00:02:06.230> I've<00:02:06.770> got

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
if the butter clarified well I've got

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.410 
if the butter clarified well I've got
two<00:02:07.070> jars<00:02:07.280> right<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.760> these<00:02:08.030> are<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.300> two

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
two jars right here these are the two

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.470 
two jars right here these are the two
and<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> half<00:02:08.720> cup<00:02:08.960> ball<00:02:09.200> jars<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.330> right<00:02:11.330> here

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
and a half cup ball jars and right here

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.210 
and a half cup ball jars and right here
I've<00:02:11.600> got<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:12.050> leftover<00:02:12.530> G<00:02:12.680> from<00:02:12.920> another

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
I've got some leftover G from another

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.010 
I've got some leftover G from another
batch<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.270> want<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> add<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
batch and I just want to add to it so

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.180 
batch and I just want to add to it so
that's<00:02:15.110> why<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.410> there<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.860> want<00:02:16.040> two

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that's why that's there you want two

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.760 
that's why that's there you want two
jars<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.300> rest<00:02:18.050> your<00:02:18.200> filter<00:02:18.620> on

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
jars so that you can rest your filter on

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.200 
jars so that you can rest your filter on
here<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.340> doesn't<00:02:19.370> slip<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
here so that it doesn't slip it's just a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.370 
here so that it doesn't slip it's just a
small<00:02:20.480> tidbit<00:02:20.690> that's<00:02:21.020> not<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.350> that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
small tidbit that's not really that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.410 
small tidbit that's not really that
necessary<00:02:21.680> okay<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.000> process

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
necessary okay then it's just a process

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.310 
necessary okay then it's just a process
of<00:02:24.010> scooping<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.110> letting<00:02:27.110> it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
of scooping this out and letting it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.940 
of scooping this out and letting it
filter<00:02:27.680> through

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.920 

and<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.910> goes<00:02:34.970> pretty<00:02:35.150> fast<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.750> first

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and it goes pretty fast when you first

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.750 
and it goes pretty fast when you first
start<00:02:36.260> because<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.010> paper<00:02:37.220> towel<00:02:37.459> doesn't

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
start because the paper towel doesn't

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.970 
start because the paper towel doesn't
have<00:02:37.970> too<00:02:38.150> much<00:02:38.270> gunk<00:02:38.569> in<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.900> as<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.830> go<00:02:39.950> along

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
have too much gunk in it as you go along

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.770 
have too much gunk in it as you go along
it'll<00:02:40.459> get<00:02:40.610> slower<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.060> slower<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.660> also

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
it'll get slower and slower you also

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.120 
it'll get slower and slower you also
might<00:02:41.989> need<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.200> change<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.470> paper<00:02:42.680> towel<00:02:42.920> when

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
might need to change a paper towel when

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.220 
might need to change a paper towel when
it<00:02:43.250> gets<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.489> little<00:02:43.640> bit<00:02:43.819> too<00:02:44.000> gunky<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:45.200> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it gets a little bit too gunky but I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.020 
it gets a little bit too gunky but I
just<00:02:45.500> grabbed<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> new<00:02:45.920> one<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.280> it'll<00:02:46.459> go<00:02:47.000> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
just grabbed a new one and it'll go a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.970 
just grabbed a new one and it'll go a
little<00:02:47.180> bit<00:02:47.360> smoother<00:02:47.720> after<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.140> once<00:02:48.890> you

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
little bit smoother after that once you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.320 
little bit smoother after that once you
get<00:02:49.099> close<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.550> bottom<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.940> milk<00:02:50.150> fat

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
get close to the bottom the milk fat

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.110 
get close to the bottom the milk fat
starts<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.750> try<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.260> into<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> spoon<00:02:51.860> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
starts to try and get into the spoon so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.190 
starts to try and get into the spoon so
really<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.150> at<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.450> point<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:53.989> need

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
really just at that point you just need

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.080 
really just at that point you just need
to<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.470> careful<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.130> make<00:02:55.550> sure<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.910> you're

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
to be careful and make sure that you're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.420 
to be careful and make sure that you're
only<00:02:56.239> getting<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.810> part<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.950> want<00:02:58.160> and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
only getting the part that you want and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.949 
only getting the part that you want and
as<00:02:58.610> long<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.030> dish<00:02:59.209> isn't<00:02:59.390> still<00:02:59.720> hot<00:02:59.930> you

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
as long as the dish isn't still hot you

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.910 
as long as the dish isn't still hot you
can<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.350> course<00:03:00.560> turn<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.010> over<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.459> but

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
can of course turn it over like this but

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.229 
can of course turn it over like this but
really<00:03:03.920> that's<00:03:04.130> all<00:03:04.280> there<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.849> and

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
really that's all there is to it and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.550 
really that's all there is to it and
then<00:03:05.510> once<00:03:05.750> you're<00:03:05.870> done<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.110> get<00:03:06.350> this

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
then once you're done you get this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.250 
then once you're done you get this
golden<00:03:07.250> delicious<00:03:07.760> looking<00:03:08.060> stuff<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.660> it'll

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
golden delicious looking stuff and it'll

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.509 
golden delicious looking stuff and it'll
keep<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> really<00:03:09.950> long<00:03:10.100> time<00:03:10.340> without

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
keep for a really long time without

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.309 
keep for a really long time without
refrigeration<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:12.110> generally

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
refrigeration but I generally

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.340 
refrigeration but I generally
refrigerate<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.630> could<00:03:14.780> drink<00:03:15.140> this

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
refrigerate it you could drink this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.710 
refrigerate it you could drink this
while<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.130> warm<00:03:16.430> but<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.940> wouldn't<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.540> that

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
while it's warm but it wouldn't be that

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.620 
while it's warm but it wouldn't be that
Pleasant<00:03:18.140> okay<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:18.739> what<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.310> giel<00:03:19.700> what<00:03:20.540> we

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
Pleasant okay so what is giel what we

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.300 
Pleasant okay so what is giel what we
actually<00:03:20.959> just<00:03:21.080> made<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:21.500> clarified<00:03:22.040> butter

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
actually just made was clarified butter

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.309 
actually just made was clarified butter
ghee<00:03:22.610> actually<00:03:23.510> involves<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.140> different

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
ghee actually involves a different

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.500 
ghee actually involves a different
process<00:03:24.920> where<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.220> use<00:03:25.519> some<00:03:25.790> goat<00:03:26.060> yogurt

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
process where you use some goat yogurt

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.449 
process where you use some goat yogurt
we<00:03:26.660> call<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> ghee<00:03:27.140> anyway<00:03:27.530> just<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.980> be<00:03:28.130> simple

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
we call a ghee anyway just to be simple

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.390 
we call a ghee anyway just to be simple
but<00:03:28.730> ghee<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.360> butter<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.530> all<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.100> milk

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
but ghee is butter with all of the milk

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.309 
but ghee is butter with all of the milk
solids<00:03:31.700> removed<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.810> what<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.019> means<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
solids removed and what that means is

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.539 
solids removed and what that means is
that<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.530> still<00:03:33.769> have<00:03:33.799> all<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.340> butter

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
that you still have all of the butter

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.430 
that you still have all of the butter
fat<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.330> vitamins<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.900> nutrients<00:03:36.380> that

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
fat and the vitamins and nutrients that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.080 
fat and the vitamins and nutrients that
you'd<00:03:36.650> get<00:03:36.739> from<00:03:36.799> butter<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.610> don't<00:03:37.880> have

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
you'd get from butter but you don't have

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.610 
you'd get from butter but you don't have
any<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.510> milk<00:03:38.720> solids<00:03:38.989> which<00:03:39.320> include

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
any of the milk solids which include

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.410 
any of the milk solids which include
casein<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.370> lactose<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.090> if<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.239> have<00:03:41.390> a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
casein and lactose so if you have a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.240 
casein and lactose so if you have a
dairy<00:03:41.750> allergy<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.440> still<00:03:42.739> eat<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:42.980> and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
dairy allergy you can still eat it and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.069 
dairy allergy you can still eat it and
butter<00:03:43.609> is<00:03:43.760> actually<00:03:43.940> extremely<00:03:44.720> nutritious

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
butter is actually extremely nutritious

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.509 
butter is actually extremely nutritious
I<00:03:45.470> know<00:03:45.560> I've<00:03:45.739> mentioned<00:03:45.920> before<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.459> our

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
I know I've mentioned before in our

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.690 
I know I've mentioned before in our
other<00:03:46.700> videos<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:47.930> fat<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.590> kind<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.430> made<00:03:49.579> out

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
other videos but fat is kind of made out

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.640 
other videos but fat is kind of made out
to<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.090> villain<00:03:50.299> in<00:03:50.660> your<00:03:50.720> nutrition<00:03:51.440> when

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
to be the villain in your nutrition when

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.229 
to be the villain in your nutrition when
it's<00:03:51.859> actually<00:03:52.100> one<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.609> most<00:03:52.790> important

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
it's actually one of the most important

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.759 
it's actually one of the most important
nutrients<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.140> in<00:03:54.350> fact<00:03:54.590> your

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
nutrients that you have in fact your

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.949 
nutrients that you have in fact your
brain<00:03:54.920> can't<00:03:55.370> metabolize<00:03:55.730> anything<00:03:56.390> but<00:03:56.690> fat

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
brain can't metabolize anything but fat

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.690 
brain can't metabolize anything but fat
so<00:03:57.230> considering<00:03:57.739> all<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.070> food<00:03:58.280> allergies

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
so considering all of the food allergies

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.580 
so considering all of the food allergies
that<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:58.970> have<00:03:59.120> these<00:03:59.329> days<00:03:59.570> it's<00:04:00.109> really<00:04:00.440> good

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
that we have these days it's really good

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.590 
that we have these days it's really good
to<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.799> able<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:01.010> have<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> high<00:04:01.730> nutrient<00:04:02.329> foods

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
to be able to have a high nutrient foods

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.599 
to be able to have a high nutrient foods
like<00:04:02.989> butter<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:03.890> not<00:04:04.070> have<00:04:04.250> any<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
like butter but not have any of the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.310 
like butter but not have any of the
problems<00:04:04.820> that's<00:04:05.120> associated<00:04:05.359> with<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.049> from

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
problems that's associated with it from

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.960 
problems that's associated with it from
the<00:04:06.410> casing<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> lactose<00:04:07.459> now<00:04:07.640> as<00:04:07.850> you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
the casing and the lactose now as you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.300 
the casing and the lactose now as you
saw<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.329> video<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.900> use<00:04:09.200> Carey<00:04:09.739> gold<00:04:10.040> brand

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
saw in the video I use Carey gold brand

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.949 
saw in the video I use Carey gold brand
butter<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> reason<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.510> use<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.810> is

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
butter and the reason I use this is

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.229 
butter and the reason I use this is
because<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:13.070> cows<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.640> make<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.030> butter

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
because the cows that make the butter

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.380 
because the cows that make the butter
are<00:04:14.829> grass-fed<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.130> cows<00:04:16.579> are<00:04:16.789> only<00:04:17.000> supposed

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
are grass-fed and cows are only supposed

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.360 
are grass-fed and cows are only supposed
to<00:04:17.510> eat<00:04:17.750> grass<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> have<00:04:18.709> healthier<00:04:19.100> cows

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
to eat grass so you have healthier cows

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.190 
to eat grass so you have healthier cows
when<00:04:19.669> they're<00:04:19.789> eating<00:04:20.060> grass<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.510> naturally

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
when they're eating grass and naturally

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.750 
when they're eating grass and naturally
a<00:04:21.229> better<00:04:21.410> tasting<00:04:21.769> butter<00:04:22.010> if<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.370> can<00:04:22.610> get

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
a better tasting butter if you can get

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.190 
a better tasting butter if you can get
the<00:04:22.880> butter<00:04:23.060> from<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> farmers<00:04:23.720> market<00:04:23.750> where

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
the butter from the farmers market where

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.020 
the butter from the farmers market where
it's<00:04:24.380> unpasteurized<00:04:25.190> that's<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.729> best<00:04:25.910> way

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
it's unpasteurized that's the best way

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.940 
it's unpasteurized that's the best way
to<00:04:26.060> do<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.390> because<00:04:26.810> then<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.229> have<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:27.770> its

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
to do it because then you have it in its

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.740 
to do it because then you have it in its
most<00:04:28.130> natural<00:04:28.370> form<00:04:28.850> with<00:04:29.210> all<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.630> good

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
most natural form with all the good

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.420 
most natural form with all the good
bacteria<00:04:29.900> still<00:04:30.530> inside<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:30.919> it<00:04:31.130> but<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> know

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
bacteria still inside of it but I know

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.800 
bacteria still inside of it but I know
it's<00:04:31.700> not<00:04:31.760> always<00:04:32.030> an<00:04:32.210> option<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.660> get

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
it's not always an option to get

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.659 
it's not always an option to get
unpasteurized<00:04:33.710> butter<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.220> if<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.370> can't<00:04:34.550> go

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
unpasteurized butter so if you can't go

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.920 
unpasteurized butter so if you can't go
to<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.820> farmers<00:04:35.120> market<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.419> usually<00:04:35.720> find

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
to the farmers market you usually find

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
to the farmers market you usually find
butter<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.380> says<00:04:36.590> raw<00:04:36.919> or<00:04:37.190> unpasteurized<00:04:37.400> on

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
butter that says raw or unpasteurized on

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.559 
butter that says raw or unpasteurized on
it<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.479> that's<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.840> kind<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.200> would

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
it and that's the kind that I would

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.540 
it and that's the kind that I would
Kamandi<00:04:39.869> use<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.319> anyway<00:04:40.619> for<00:04:40.830> myself<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.339> eat

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
Kamandi use but anyway for myself I eat

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.100 
Kamandi use but anyway for myself I eat
it<00:04:41.669> all<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.879> time<00:04:42.089> I<00:04:42.360> don't<00:04:42.629> even<00:04:42.779> actually

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
it all the time I don't even actually

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.899 
it all the time I don't even actually
put<00:04:43.259> it<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:43.469> anything<00:04:43.679> but<00:04:44.309> it<00:04:44.429> actually<00:04:44.580> is

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
put it on anything but it actually is

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.700 
put it on anything but it actually is
really<00:04:45.360> good<00:04:45.539> for<00:04:45.749> cooking<00:04:45.899> because<00:04:46.379> it<00:04:46.529> has<00:04:46.679> a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
really good for cooking because it has a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.649 
really good for cooking because it has a
higher<00:04:47.009> smoke<00:04:47.460> point<00:04:47.490> than<00:04:48.059> regular<00:04:48.449> butter

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
higher smoke point than regular butter

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.139 
higher smoke point than regular butter
so<00:04:49.199> if<00:04:49.319> you're<00:04:49.439> sauteing<00:04:49.919> something<00:04:50.459> the

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:51.149 
so if you're sauteing something the

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:53.449 
so if you're sauteing something the
butter<00:04:51.509> won't<00:04:51.719> burn<00:04:52.080> as<00:04:52.289> easily<00:04:52.559> also<00:04:53.009> of<00:04:53.309> note

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:53.459 
butter won't burn as easily also of note

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.459 
butter won't burn as easily also of note
is<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.699> when<00:04:54.449> you're<00:04:54.599> cooking<00:04:54.719> with<00:04:55.110> oils

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
is that when you're cooking with oils

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.859 
is that when you're cooking with oils
you<00:04:56.339> should<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.729> only<00:04:56.879> use<00:04:57.209> coconut<00:04:57.509> oil

00:04:57.859 --> 00:04:57.869 
you should really only use coconut oil

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.980 
you should really only use coconut oil
or<00:04:58.229> butter<00:04:58.619> and<00:04:58.979> that's<00:04:59.459> because<00:04:59.849> most<00:05:00.449> oils

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
or butter and that's because most oils

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.109 
or butter and that's because most oils
are<00:05:01.229> destroyed<00:05:01.800> at<00:05:02.039> high<00:05:02.249> heats<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.819> actually

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:03.119 
are destroyed at high heats it actually

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:04.969 
are destroyed at high heats it actually
changes<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.689> molecular<00:05:03.839> structure<00:05:04.559> of<00:05:04.589> the

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
changes the molecular structure of the

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.559 
changes the molecular structure of the
fat<00:05:05.189> when<00:05:05.729> you're<00:05:05.819> cooking<00:05:05.969> with<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:06.419> at<00:05:06.509> a

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
fat when you're cooking with it at a

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:07.939 
fat when you're cooking with it at a
high<00:05:06.749> heat<00:05:06.929> so<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.259> example<00:05:07.619> you<00:05:07.709> don't<00:05:07.740> want

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
high heat so for example you don't want

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.769 
high heat so for example you don't want
to<00:05:08.099> cook<00:05:08.219> with<00:05:08.279> olive<00:05:08.699> oil<00:05:08.789> ever<00:05:09.149> your<00:05:09.599> body

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
to cook with olive oil ever your body

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.329 
to cook with olive oil ever your body
can<00:05:09.959> make<00:05:10.110> it<00:05:10.229> go<00:05:10.259> through<00:05:10.679> but<00:05:10.949> it's<00:05:11.129> not

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:11.339 
can make it go through but it's not

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.949 
can make it go through but it's not
gonna<00:05:11.520> be<00:05:11.580> very<00:05:11.909> good<00:05:12.119> for<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.419> so<00:05:12.629> anyway<00:05:12.930> I

eating<00:05:18.569> butter<00:05:18.779> it's<00:05:19.349> slightly<00:05:19.770> different

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
eating butter it's slightly different

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.679 
eating butter it's slightly different
but<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.789> get<00:05:20.939> used<00:05:21.089> to<00:05:21.149> the<00:05:21.270> taste<00:05:21.449> pretty

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:21.689 
but you get used to the taste pretty

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.329 
but you get used to the taste pretty
quickly<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.439> really<00:05:22.649> cheap<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.009> easy<00:05:23.219> to

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:23.339 
quickly it's really cheap and easy to

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:24.920 
quickly it's really cheap and easy to
make<00:05:23.459> as<00:05:23.819> long<00:05:23.939> as<00:05:24.089> you<00:05:24.180> buy<00:05:24.330> your<00:05:24.539> own<00:05:24.569> butter

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
make as long as you buy your own butter

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.199 
make as long as you buy your own butter
you<00:05:25.379> can<00:05:25.499> see<00:05:25.680> here<00:05:25.919> really<00:05:26.339> the<00:05:26.520> only<00:05:26.789> step<00:05:27.059> is

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:27.209 
you can see here really the only step is

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.790 
you can see here really the only step is
to<00:05:27.330> heat<00:05:27.539> it<00:05:27.659> in<00:05:27.719> the<00:05:27.839> oven<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.289> then<00:05:28.589> you<00:05:28.709> have

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
to heat it in the oven and then you have

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.350 
to heat it in the oven and then you have
to<00:05:28.889> take<00:05:29.039> ten<00:05:29.219> minutes<00:05:29.369> to<00:05:29.639> strain<00:05:29.909> it<00:05:29.939> out<00:05:30.119> but

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
to take ten minutes to strain it out but

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.699 
to take ten minutes to strain it out but
that's<00:05:30.509> not<00:05:30.749> hard<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.050> do<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.349> it's<00:05:31.469> actually

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:31.709 
that's not hard to do and it's actually

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.320 
that's not hard to do and it's actually
kind<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.949> satisfying<00:05:32.430> Washington<00:05:32.939> go<00:05:33.059> through

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
kind of satisfying Washington go through

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.670 
kind of satisfying Washington go through
