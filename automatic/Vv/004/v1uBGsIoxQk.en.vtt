 so I know exactly what they 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.270
 previous video on spartan at sault at 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.460

 vertical scrolling fire as the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.080

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.439
 to put the hard drive is that thing to gia 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.899
 the most a lot of room so the date 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.109
 publication and of 18 July 2013 on 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.719

 last january 2014 on xbox 360 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.880
 it's a relative pleasure of law 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.579
 happens and still about 360 after like 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.820
 a period of attack is this 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.859
 painful so well I'll show you 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.859
 a little mission to show you the 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.210
 mechanical gaming so you have to know 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.039
 I still just return 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.469
 back and there is like to our 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.750
 cooperation and a tutorial mode for 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.729
 the people who they did the tutorial 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.810
 to support each other noob we know but must 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.210
 do it still interesting you 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.280
 go see the coop mode simply 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.750
 our kop then this is not the split 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.340
 split screen farc what I call 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 the split screen is the mops 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.600
 with a friend at home is 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.490
 coop online 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.010
 and after all that is parameters of 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:36.050
 game and and so that's gone 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:38.660
 launches I count like that yes here 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980
 I run and I do not know maybe not the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.580
 first mission for passport he puts 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.630
 the random missions did not either 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.330
 can cinematic especially good here I 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 do not know me mission I want galley 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.190
 for that matter 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.830
 this one so here's no but it's cool 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.990
 it's a pegi 12 to his own so if your 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.040
 kid you have a sim kid and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.130
 would have for most of you 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.630
 but you have a kid 12 years old it's good 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.800
 not exceptional so we come to a 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.780
 Greek armor menu 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.890
 matured medard we will be able to choose 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.840
 our weapons then our weapons are are little 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.210
 the expenses and with xp we win 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.990
 as you play halo or 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:28.880
 then or so if I select see 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:32.980
 it is either 500 xp or 25 cr 750 xp in 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.900
 earth but he's getting cancer then 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.220
 the xp that i told you this is the point 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
 that we win as and when the game and 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.720
 the cr are credits that can 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.930
 buy with real money then 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.180
 this is not the fold for wind since 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.380
 anyway the game remains relatively 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.700
 simple it is clear that it is easier 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.700
 to have a rocket at all 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.900
 missions but it's not really 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.100
 no need to finish the game 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.270
 easily between the puy and then lo 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.459
 always the possibility as in the 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 Halls Taxes taxes and armor 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.950
 since halo 4 all cases report 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.570
 armor and booster so at the power 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.489
 darmian classical letters when we 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.980
 knows everything at the head drones with heads 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.090
 researcher we did not know a 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.989
 tarnishes another I think it's more 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.010
 is 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.940
 and then yes it's after this 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.080
 score multiplier that can be 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.169
 interesting for people who do 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.840
 scoring samson xp it's not necessarily 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:31.610
 dear sees the skulls whose skulls 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.960
 as in as in most of them 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.930
 others to the water so these parties 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.350
 wanting that I show you what it's like 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.950
 graphically give that his style it's 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.660
 not ugly it's not necessarily pretty pretty 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 but it 's more like his style was good and 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.419
 I was able to choose the right mission 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.849
 since it's a mission that played 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.469
 with the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.529
 then to play long saw with 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:55.819
 the right joystick with the joystick 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.499
 from the left we simply move 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.849
 I will not show I'm just 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:06.959
 little grunt and then I show you when 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:09.659
 I go there on foot and I am 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:14.580
 put a word and I have what how 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:17.339
 okay this year yes I have not 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.749
 of weapons actually I have an assault rifle 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:23.969
 super pomegranate abaya 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:30.089
 I am taught grenades which even 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:31.469
 in game happy soup that we can change the 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.259
 then graphically trumps the style 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.219
 graphic does a little bit of drawing I 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.279
 find that it has its style 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:42.860
 it's going well with the halo universe the 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:45.659
 graphical paw is very pretty so not 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.269
 it's not like a game like now 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.709
 krisis my thing is an arcade game on 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.860
 taste of 15 euros should not be expected 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:54.269
 a trick either crazy furiously allocated 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.849
 five blows what is at the level of 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:58.769
 lawyers need 15 euros must not mess 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.180
 what to see 5 euros to paint them 

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:02.039
 tensions on the rings so come to come 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.249
 talk about it right away 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.659
 so I play there is a reduction so 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.490
 be careful when you buy it from 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.159
 well go on the discount for them 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.810
 people who already have the game on a 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.370
 platform 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.350
 especially on the test platform me I 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.530
 had it on pc the game be the version 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.930
 xbox one or the xbox 360 version does not cost 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.760
 than 5 euros instead of 14 years so 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:29.250
 it's nice from 2 343 2 finally 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.120
 the share of 340 space 343 ch is there for 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.240
 something in all cases 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.230
 microsoft of thinking or those who we 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.250
 have already bought because it's 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.740
 exactly the same momentum 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:43.470
 except my kop and more but otherwise 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:48.830
 it's exactly the nest of shit rites 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.830
 and I advise you it is this city 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:57.070
 here again and give way to what I 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:06.360
 seems odd is that seasons by 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:06.360
 have sealed the way preceptor 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.200
 so good I do not know if that tells you to 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.120
 buy it you otherwise on xbox or on pc 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.640
 but now it's really worth it 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.920
 it's nice it's a good little game it's 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.460
 a good little defouloir 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.720
 after a range of 4h bikes ieba you 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.750
 launch go on the assault of this 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.320
 quiet opposed good ben voila 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.880
 it was a little so sure sure a sure 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:41.450
 lot spartans have said very soon for 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.450
 other videos go ciao bye friends
