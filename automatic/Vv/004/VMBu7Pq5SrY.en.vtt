00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.610
 so hello 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.830
 after 29 years it has me now too 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.740
 finally caught I hope that it 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.869
 no mistake but only the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.619
 Disk was broken that there was one more 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.230
 the first device that has everything like that and 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:43.390
 We want to determine that now 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:53.140
 if you have that noise and still 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:55.780
 let's turn it off immediately and me 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.270
 Hope this is really only the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 Hard drive is and how to endure 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 of course, I show you now of electricity 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.160
 here is the flap 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:26.490
 I already have the three screws 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.369
 removed in the grip of one side down 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.969
 push out then you have the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.460
 hard disk 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.209
 Here I have an original playstation 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.399
 hard disk which we will install now 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.209
 on the back goes two 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.209
 unscrew screws 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 remove hard disk from the housing 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.869
 the new one is reinstate 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 of course that annoying her now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.690
 breaks down four months before the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.690
 next playstation 4 comes out 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:39.300
 we just want to hope that really 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 only the hard disk is so hard disk 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:48.000
 important behind the two screws 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.770
 make clear again push for 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.160
 above 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:01.530
 Turn the stream in and hope for now 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:12.510
 that it was just the hard drive that was 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:15.330
 you realize immediately that is natural 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.960
 now a big crap thats more of that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.960
 ilo error 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.570
 you can treat him in the short term by 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.950
 In the back you get a hair dryer for you 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.830
 minutes then cooled down again immediately or 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.420
 another trick in the oven 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.890
 but it is not permanent, either 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.380
 that will probably be a total loss 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.959
 There are not many companies that do that 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.900
 Repair the repair is in between 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.370
 100 and 150 euros 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 Well worth the short before the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.910
 Playstation 4 you have to come out 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.040
 decide for yourself 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.739
 So for me it is annoying now 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:03.350
 but you can not do anything 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:08.250
 she has been doing good services for nine years 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.830
 So kill them, I hope 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.670
 could help you now 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:19.760
 So whether you also to many then to 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.760
 because look and watch
