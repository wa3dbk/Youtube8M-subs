00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570

in the tents are about the middle part
of<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.720> 10th<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.200> would<00:04:20.380> think<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.950> this

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
of the 10th you would think that this

think it's a tribute to his conditioning

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.530 
think it's a tribute to his conditioning
and<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:29.100> fact<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.640> he<00:04:29.910> wanted<00:04:30.330> this
