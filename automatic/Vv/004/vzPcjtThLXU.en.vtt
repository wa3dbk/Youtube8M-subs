is that they want to fund now this is
important<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:03.180> most

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
important to know because most

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
important to know because most
organizations<00:02:03.630> will<00:02:04.320> publish<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.950> strategy

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
organizations will publish a strategy
