 All code is your favorite weapon because 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.840
 I also liked call of duty for 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.639
 a long time when he had gone to the house 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.920
 from a friend and more that's why I bought myself 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.540
 an xbox y and so on and my favorite weapon of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.730
 all the call of duty is the fame of 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.700

 I need to do it and still 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 because people do not ask me a lot and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.939

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 ask for more there I will upload what is your 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.900
 favorite because my favorite color is the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.969
 modern warfare2 because it is more 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.859
 realistic and I do not really like what it is 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.949

 pokémon de seguí to follow 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.750
 because I liked his tongs and I do not know 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.760
 well sexy and so my favorite video game 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.740
 I think it's the Simpsons who's 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.300
 sometimes I went up here in the channel and it 's this 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.610
 question that there was in humorous she of 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.070
 omega warfare and told me if you know the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.710

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.810

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.670
 vega and nothing because I know what is Spanish 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.220
 and a little bit of English the truth is I'm missing 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.960
 a lot of English vocabulary but so if 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.700

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.380
 approximately how long do you teach there 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.900

 6 to 8 hours boys and I know it's 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.840
 much and everything but the truth is that in my 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.120
 compu is disgusting and I have to be 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.710

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.840
