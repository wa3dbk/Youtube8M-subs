the<00:05:39.950> dynamic<00:05:40.100> in<00:05:40.580> locker<00:05:40.790> room<00:05:41.090> that's<00:05:42.080> fun<00:05:42.260> I

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
the dynamic in locker room that's fun I

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.340

think<00:05:42.800> once<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:44.090> know<00:05:44.180> it<00:05:44.300> took<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.840> little<00:05:45.230> bit

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
think once you know it took a little bit

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.830 
think once you know it took a little bit
of<00:05:45.470> time<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:46.010> us<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:47.120> get<00:05:47.420> to<00:05:47.540> know<00:05:47.690> each

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
of time for us to to get to know each

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.140

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
chemistry that was needed in order for

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.720 
chemistry that was needed in order for
us<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.330> get<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:54.230> level<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:54.620> we're<00:05:54.890> we're
