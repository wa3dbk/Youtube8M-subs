other<00:00:38.940> maps<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.600> he<00:00:39.660> putted<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.610> which

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
other maps I think he putted this which

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
other maps I think he putted this which
is<00:00:41.730> pretty<00:00:41.969> good<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:43.079> big

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
is pretty good because it's pretty big

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
is pretty good because it's pretty big
so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.520> big<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:44.820> normal<00:00:45.149> Hunger

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so it's not as big as normal Hunger

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160 
so it's not as big as normal Hunger
Games<00:00:45.690> maps<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.350> other<00:00:46.770> life<00:00:47.700> minecraft<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.539> PC
