00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 I think I have enough now 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.080
 I answered that we intense 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.719
 work with the right one 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 to train mentality every day and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.750
 self-confidence in the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.340
 to pick up workouts and with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 this attitude with last 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 consequence of going into the game 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.250
 it's about something else 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 Do not or do you believe that we are that us 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 wanted to sit here somewhere and think 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 great but that works fine and me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.660
 I'm really optimistic now I can 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 only be optimistic if I am 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.120
 have confidence when I see that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.860
 I do what we want to do 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.809
 the training ground and not in the corner 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
 Sit down with psychologists 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.719
 psychology to do nothing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.950
 Psychology is always positive when 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.930
 you defused against things 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 achieved and that we have that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.620
 we do in training but it also has to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.500
 in the game also happen in a game 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.930
 you have to work out the whole thing 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 preparation does not use anything you have to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.289
 then implement it and then it plays too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.699
 how do i go directly into the game? 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.830
 Landscape is from the first minute on 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.960
 this good organization is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.880
 show aggressiveness and build on it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 self-confidence sometimes too 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
 over an early gate 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 what you get what you get yourself 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.180
 so that the opponent sees so passes through the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 simply 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.500
 It's not like you do that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 that could be how you plan yours now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 can plan their movie report the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 paten the camera a bit exactly 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 why push button when you return 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.009
 express that is not so because with us 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 complicating the presence of the opponent 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.950
 this if another team 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 if they now only two teams this 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 film breaks or they would have to the other 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 kick in the bones and him the camera 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 take away then you know yourself before 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.549
 not even if they can do it or not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.729
 you turn on your camera at all 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.009
 So it's not quite so 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 just that if that were so then 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.670
 then would need therefore not to sit 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.189
 then I would say that while we were 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.899
 planned the great and now it starts 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.189
 shit the others have something too 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.189
 planned under circumstances
