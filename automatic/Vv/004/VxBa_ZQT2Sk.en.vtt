00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.199
 good your fears to a new good video 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.939
 a game is announced that will cause 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.640
 quite controversial good is causing 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.410
 quite controversial enough the game is 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.049
 flame hatred and good you have a gameplay 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.309
 in a gameplay trailer in the description 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.860
 in case you want to take a look os 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.949
 I recommend in fact take a look 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.480
 It will be very similar to this surely 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.939
 more than fixed a little bit not in certain 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.300
 meaning because the game I do not know if that 's 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 good or it becomes bad not what it 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.910
 that I behind this game basically 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.529
 that we have a person tired of 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.029
 world we could say full of hate and 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.830
 well, basically for seven 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.890
 levels we have to kill all the 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.060
 world do not kill masses of people and others I 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.220
 from what I 've seen in the trailer has not 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.720
 seen no difficulty or anything for the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 style basically because we think it's 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.940
 violence for fun not pure 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.370
 fun we could say I'm going to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.320
 repeat I do not know if this is good or bad 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.060
 for certain players, as you already know 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.370
 I respect all videogames 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.340
 logically good if whatever it seems 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.860
 a game of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.270
 I do not know, you understand, there are limits, I'm not going 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.640
 I'm not going to name things that I do not want 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.379
 name but there are fucking limits and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 you do not have to pass them maybe this 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.330
 it's furrowing the line for a lot of people 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.100
 in fact in the USA it is causing 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.990
 a lot of controversy because you already know that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.479
 they have gone into institutes and other 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.369
 have other people and this kind of stuff and 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.170
 well they are not very happy with the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.160
 typical deranged people who just 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.440
 killing hundreds of people not with 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.720
 susan or more and others I do not think they are 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.310
 very happy good game will come out games 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.410
 an independent developer for the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 what you call destructive creations and 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.240
 will come out in the second quarter of 2015 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.820
 only for pc and it is developed 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.410
 with the unreal engine 4 engine and in fact 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.290
 epic games have wanted them to retire 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.860
 all the logos of your graphic engine in 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.330
 the trailer and I really do not know how to judge by 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 yourselves it is true that it is 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 chilling but it is still a 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.030
 video game but logically I can 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.920
 understand that some people because he 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.200
 bother kind of things can have it 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.390
 there are perfectly sensitive people and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.690
 normal I also can not stand some 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.790
 some things of the day 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.160
 logically we live in a time since 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.220
 every time the games are more real and there are 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.140
 limits so if the crosses if you have 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.680
 8 bits the game as it not only enters but 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 when we are already playing a quality 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.610
 high graph and everything will have a lot 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.540
 repercussion and remember what I say 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.520
 a gta season gta 7 will end up having 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.800
 very, very many repercussions 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.300
 I mean when the graphics reach 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.000
 have a quality that really 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.320
 - Talking about gta 6.007 I do not think that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.180
 we get to that graphic quality that I 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.540
 I'm thinking but if a quality 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.400
 really high graph in which bonus 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 really, it's hard to distinguish the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.820
 reality of fiction then then to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.530
 what's going to happen are going to happen a lot 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.840
 things are not going to be censured 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.580
 enough things that that difference in 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.170
 a movie from a video game then in 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 nothing could be that video games 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.460
 they are like that but not if they watch a movie 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.460
 about this surely would not happen 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.650
 absolutely nothing but I understand all 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.560
 the parts of truth I'm a guy 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.210
 quite sympathetic and in fact I to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.800
 see the trailer has also been cold 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.780
 quite not see the fan that this 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.210
 recognize the rivals of scenes that do not 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.040
 they love each other they have not caused me anything 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.080
 inside I do not know why just very good fucking 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.170
 done very well recreated because I have 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.220
 touched the fiber really repudiates or 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.980
 something I do not know 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.840
 well nothing more kids are probably going 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.340
 to be the games I will try to upload it for 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.620
 that you take a look to analyze it 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 a little more in depth but for 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.000
 now as I say you can see the trailer
