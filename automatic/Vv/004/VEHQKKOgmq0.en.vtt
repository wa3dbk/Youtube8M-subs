thing getting that factory down and
another<00:03:26.380> refinery<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:29.240> who<00:03:29.450> knows<00:03:29.630> might<00:03:29.900> be

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020

that<00:03:36.650> was<00:03:36.890> able<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.610> let<00:03:38.000> him<00:03:38.180> win<00:03:38.360> was<00:03:38.900> first

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that was able to let him win was first

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.990

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.409 
especially if the other players going
for<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> siege<00:04:15.800> tank<00:04:16.100> right<00:04:16.310> there<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.150> if<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
for a siege tank right there so if the

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.420 
for a siege tank right there so if the
timing<00:04:18.049> attack<00:04:18.290> was<00:04:18.440> lining<00:04:18.859> up<00:04:18.980> right<00:04:19.280> about

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
timing attack was lining up right about

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.690 
timing attack was lining up right about
now<00:04:19.579> very<00:04:20.480> powerful<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.859> can<00:04:21.980> get<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.520> can

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
now very powerful you can get in you can

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.000 
now very powerful you can get in you can
sometimes<00:04:23.300> even<00:04:23.570> end<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.870> game<00:04:24.050> if<00:04:24.350> your

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
sometimes even end the game if your

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.620 
sometimes even end the game if your
micro<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.610> perfect<00:04:26.540> which<00:04:27.530> mine<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:28.070> not<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:29.300> i

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
micro is perfect which mine is not so i

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.240 
micro is perfect which mine is not so i
usually<00:04:30.050> don't<00:04:30.229> win<00:04:30.470> i<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.010> something

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
usually don't win i just do something

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.700 
usually don't win i just do something
kind<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.550> cool<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.150> Keth<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.780> luck<00:04:32.960> doing<00:04:33.229> this

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
kind of cool and Keth on luck doing this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.370 
kind of cool and Keth on luck doing this
again<00:04:34.340> I'm<00:04:34.639> not<00:04:34.880> sure<00:04:34.940> why<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.540> starboard<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
again I'm not sure why the starboard is

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.980 
again I'm not sure why the starboard is
placed<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.860> way<00:04:37.479> maybe<00:04:38.479> he's<00:04:38.660> trying<00:04:38.840> to

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
placed this way maybe he's trying to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.129 
placed this way maybe he's trying to
hide<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.290> from<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.740> scan<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:41.870> know<00:04:41.960> that's

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
hide it from a scan I don't know that's

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.969 
hide it from a scan I don't know that's
all<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.320> can<00:04:42.440> guess<00:04:42.740> about<00:04:42.979> this<00:04:43.340> starboard<00:04:43.760> and

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
all I can guess about this starboard and

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.040 
all I can guess about this starboard and
this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.100> very<00:04:46.330> actually<00:04:47.330> every<00:04:47.870> time

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
this is very actually every time

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.600 
this is very actually every time
changing<00:04:48.680> from<00:04:48.830> his<00:04:48.979> first<00:04:49.190> game<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.430> little

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
changing from his first game a little

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.310 
changing from his first game a little
bit<00:04:49.729> is<00:04:50.120> actually<00:04:50.450> getting<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.810> starport

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
bit is actually getting that starport

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.219 
bit is actually getting that starport
only<00:04:51.950> slightly<00:04:52.340> behind<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:53.540> fon<00:04:53.780> luck<00:04:53.990> so

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
only slightly behind the fon luck so

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.980 
only slightly behind the fon luck so
maybe<00:04:54.530> he's<00:04:54.770> going<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:54.979> be<00:04:55.510> trying<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.720> win

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
maybe he's going to be trying to win

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.469 
maybe he's going to be trying to win
that<00:04:57.169> air<00:04:57.410> dominance<00:04:57.590> battle<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:59.180> we<00:04:59.330> gots

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
that air dominance battle so we gots

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.560 
that air dominance battle so we gots
each<00:04:59.690> tech<00:04:59.990> going<00:05:00.320> down<00:05:00.500> for<00:05:00.860> every<00:05:01.100> time

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
each tech going down for every time

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.240 
each tech going down for every time
looks<00:05:02.570> like<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.780> fun<00:05:03.080> look<00:05:03.229> is<00:05:03.410> delaying<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.100> a

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
looks like a fun look is delaying that a

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.330 
looks like a fun look is delaying that a
little<00:05:04.790> bit<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:06.229> there<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> attack<00:05:07.070> coming
