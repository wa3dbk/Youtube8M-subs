00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.100
 therefore following the proposals of tutorials and 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.840
 following your preferences 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.190
 we will start with it or briefly everything 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.080
 with so is there we will first work 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.700
 the introduction half that is to say 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.389
 the first two positions is at 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.389
 say this 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.610
 here we are hood 0 if you do not have 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.669
 cadastre 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 then a little information I turn 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.560
 videos in hd ie 1280 by 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.720
 720 80 but you from youtube you them 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.970
 shows in small by default and in 360 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.400
 so bottom right videos there are 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.410
 the buttons youtube settings and so on 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.050
 you can enlarge the video and you 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 can choose a better quality 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.370
 then for tablatures those 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.030
 who do not know the six lines 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 correspond to the six strings of the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 guitar the line quite downstairs 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 that's the serious agreement 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 that is to say on the guitar the one that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.360
 is at the top and the numbers that are 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 marked the numbers there is the box 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.210
 which must be supported by 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.570
 example at the beginning the g9 is marked 1 3 2 3 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 so we will press the third box 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.729
 of the 6th rope 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.010
 so we will work first 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 first measure g9 that is to say only 9th 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.670
 quite a while ago I put you a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 complete position of the sun agreement 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.229
 ninth for information but there we 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.120
 uses a simplified position so we 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.789
 simply put the middle finger on the 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.460
 third box quite in water and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.240
 then the second class index of the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 third rope the fingers a finger by 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 rope the thumb the middle finger and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.659
 the ring finger on the 6-4 strings 3-2 then 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.659
 we started to score first 3 0 2 0 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.300
 so the strings are going to be 6 4 3 4 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.180
 then 02 02 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.350
 so the strings are going to be two three 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.580
 four 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.580
 3 so we did it all slowly 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.580
 3.4 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110
 1 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.080
 in the end the measure there are two small 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.040
 points it means that you have to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 to repeat what is before the portion 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.820
 which is between two sets of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.960
 double water point as before the beginning 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.400
 of the measure there are two other points 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.410
 it is this portion that is to say this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.850
 measure must repeat cold 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.340
 the particularity is that when we go 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.960
 do it the second time in the end one 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.910
 will have to raise his hand to do the 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.020
 new agreement so the 2 that is found 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.660
 quite at the end of the measure 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.190
 the second time actually instead we 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.690
 will do 1 0 ground the david agreement because 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.220
 that we will have to raise our hand to make 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750
 the following agreement and it's perfectly 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 normal 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.650
 so we'll do this twice 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.290
 with the lifting uprising of the finger to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.290
 the end of the second time 3 4 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 Oh 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.470
 2 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.080
 this is then second measure the m9 that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.099
 means a minor 9th so that's what 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.110
 is on the top left is good 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.290
 position pretty good position simplify 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.220
 a classic miner 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.080
 normally you all know well 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.540
 this agreement the difference is that this 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.090
 douala instead of having a year box 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.840
 24 4 so we lift it up and instead we 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
 ask the little finger 4th box of the 4th 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.460
 rope 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:44.870
 we are like that E minor 9 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.370
 the strings there it's going to be 6 5 4 3 so 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.320
 the four bodies of which are out of the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.890
 guitar like a finger by rope 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:59.120
 So we will start 02/04/2011 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.599
 strings 6 5 4 5 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.599
 and then the mark and 0 4 2 4 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.470
 string number 3 4 5 4 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.000
 that's the way we go 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.010
 you have to do this twice 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.420
 since it is double point and at the end 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.739
 the second time it's the same 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.140
 will have to prepare the chord changes 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.260
 so the 4 who scored the second time 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.090
 will have to raise the hand and so to the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.100
 place we will make a zero ie the 4th 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.770
 empty cords 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.770
 so we go together 3 4 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.450
 and that's it to finish this little 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.000
 tutorial now we're going to do fully 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.040
 this section there ie twice 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.570
 the 9th floor being careful of 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.710
 lift the must at the end for the 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.420
 change of agreement but in fact correct 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.340
 and you will not have much choice and two 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.010
 once the minot comes or at the end we 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.680
 will raise the right all this will be a pole 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.680
 in 3 4 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 and 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.879
 Here I screwed up and when one raises 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.560
 rights of course so that's the little 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.889
 advice obviously that I often give 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.259
 and very important work and that very 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.050
 slowly so you do not have any 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.000
 hesitation because when you hesitate 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.860
 every time you memorize it 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.539
 hesitation and then we wait for it 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.250
 redo it is difficult so better 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.110
 work very slowly given tempo 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.310
 the tempo it takes for whom none 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.259
 hesitation all the sequences 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.360
 perfectly regular perfect like that 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.800
 of you have memorized that you 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.120
 will see that after the speed no need to 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.659
 to deal with it comes alone and that 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.460
 will be easy 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.569
 So So here I give you an appointment 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.970
 you for the next tutorial at 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.099
 fiona hick development for measurement 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.780
 3 and 4 and so we'll be done 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.069
 the introduction and way these very 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.150
 April 10 chords for verses 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.150
 see you soon
