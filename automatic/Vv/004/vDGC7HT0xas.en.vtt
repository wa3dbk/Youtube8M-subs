 Collectors top prices 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.369
 Beatle Paul McCartney has been playing on a court yard since the early sixties 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.369

 one hundred euros 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.079

 is the hall left of German rock singer Peter Maffay 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.519
