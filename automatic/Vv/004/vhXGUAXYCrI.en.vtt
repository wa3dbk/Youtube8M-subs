00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
intended to do a little bit or not you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.250 
intended to do a little bit or not you
know<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.660> bend<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.959> front<00:02:22.200> a

little<00:02:22.380> bit<00:02:22.970> sometimes<00:02:23.970> ends<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.450> looking<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
little bit sometimes ends up looking a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
little bit sometimes ends up looking a
little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.230> matron<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> thought

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
little bit like matron but I thought

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.830 
little bit like matron but I thought

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
they usually get that right but they're

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870 
they usually get that right but they're
actually<00:02:28.350> they're<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> minute<00:02:29.280> top<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.700> boots

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
actually they're the minute top of boots

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.390 
actually they're the minute top of boots
that<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.420> cut<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.260> fringe<00:02:31.470> off<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:32.010> folded

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
that I cut the fringe off of them folded

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.210 
that I cut the fringe off of them folded
down<00:02:32.810> because<00:02:33.810> they're<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.860> those<00:02:35.070> are

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
