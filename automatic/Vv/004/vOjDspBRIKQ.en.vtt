Hello everyone, this is Patricia, from Kinda Cute Cards. I hope you will like what I am going

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.990
to show you. This is my first video, so I am a little bit nervous.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.770
Today they are paper flowers. For starters, you will only need paper or cardstock, scissors

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.550
and glue. Any kind of glue would work, but I really like using a glue gun

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.140
To start, we get the cardstock and cut the corners. We can make an oval

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.680
or a circle, but only cutting the cornes will be enough. We start cutting the paper

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.060
making a spiral, trying that the edges are wider as long as we are cutting to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.170
the center

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:05.700
Once we have the flower cut, we pick up the end and we start rolling. We have to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.450
make the flower really tight, not loose

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:23.030
we will loose it later just before gluing it. Once we have it rolled, we add

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.860
the glue at the bottom, we loose the paper a little bit and we put pressure to stick it.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.979
Usually, there are threads of glue if you use a glue gun.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.310
The smallest flowers are very beautiful when you use them in bouquets or as centerpieces

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.310
if you combine them with bigger flowers. You can use them

00:01:48.310 --> 00:02:03.080
to embellish cards tor scrapbook albums too

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.720
Another thing you can do when you make flores is using different kinds of

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.629
scissors with different edges. For example, this ones I am using here are from Fiskars

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.580
and they have a very unequal edge. With this kind of scissors, you don't need to be so careful

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.560
when you cut because it is so unequal than you are not going to notice any mistakes.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.540
However, if you use another kind of scissors, they have a design that it is better

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:52.900
follow, so the flower has consistency when it is rolled.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.569
You can use larger pieces of paper. As large as you would like. However, the larger

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.849
they are, the more complicated rolling the flowers is going to be. In this case, the paper is

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.810
approximately 15 cm  in the side. Cutting a big flower can take at least one minuet,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.069
if you use decorative scissors even more, and it is very easy that the paper rolls

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.970
while you cut. When the flowers are big, you have to be careful

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.280
not to loose the paper while you roll them. If that happens, you will probably

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.819
have to start from the beginning. When you make big flowers, it is better to use

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.909
a glue gun. It is much better to glue the flowers because, although

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.650
they stick very well at the bottom, the paper is so big that the finished piece is very loose. With a glue

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.140
gun, you can add glue to those spots where the paper needs to be

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.900
more glued. If you are going to use flowers as a centerpieces it is not going to be a problem

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.569
because they are going to be still, but if you are going to used them in a bouquet

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.120
it is better that they are more motionless, although a little of movement in the flower always

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.760
is beautiful

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.090
Well, the big flower is made. These are the flowers I have made in this

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.909
video. If you combine different colors, different scissors, different sizes, you can achieve

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:34.520
a huge variety and it will be very beautiful in a table, packages, scrapbook albums,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.300
cards, etcetera.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.089
I hope you liked the video and that I can show you more things soon.

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:43.229
Thanks for being there.
