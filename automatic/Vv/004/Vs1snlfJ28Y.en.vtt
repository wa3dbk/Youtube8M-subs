00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.300
 welcome to your space we are trend 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.760
 with 5 I am sam recorded by and blogger and 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.650
 I will show you how to turn 5 today 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.019
 Give volume and movement to your hair 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.750
 creating perfect natural waves for 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.670
 any occasion it is important that the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.650
 towel absorb moisture from your hair 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.470
 try not to rub it as you can 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.660
 destroy what you remember unraveling 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.070
 hair from stockings to ends once 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680
 unraveled at the bottom 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.119
 continue with the root 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680
 do not forget to apply a product that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 moisturize and prepare your hair for 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.559
 heat can be a very light oil 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 argan or a moisturizer 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.739
 any of these three products is a 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.929
 most today to get better 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.480
 results we will use a comb with 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.609
 thin handle let's draw a line 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.249
 straight by selecting in two parts the 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.350
 top if yours is used stripe 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.059
 hand back the same way to 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.100
 it is very well defined 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.809
 later use the same comb 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.089
 to divide the top of the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.879
 lower as if you made an average 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.009
 tail that simple and the truth to me yes 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.690
 more than easier to use my fingers then 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.120
 I have little hair and it is very thin 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.710
 Take a clamp with medium teeth for 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.810
 hold what you just split 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 and so we will do it a couple of times more 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.220
 to leave the necessary hair and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.409
 start drying it attached to your hair 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.960
 with another clamp to prevent entanglement 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.360
 I'm going to use a round brush to 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.460
 thin hair my anna dryer is not 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 will my professional and a diffuser for 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 protect my hair from the heat 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.540
 the dryer has three speeds 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.850
 and three temperatures for my hair 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 we will use both in number two of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.910
 medium level thanks to my ions 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 super nano the increasingly dry very fast and 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.660
 It does not burn at all since I'm 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 using the diffuser that protects it 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.970
 dry all the sections that previously 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.460
 divide to continue begins from 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 bottom up once you get to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.470
 the middle part continues on the sides 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.780
 of your hair and always combing it with 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 the brush inside toward the tips 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.640
 here it gives you a very good type if what 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.920
 You want to create volume without frizz passes 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.720
 the dryer on the root just drying 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 this will give him body in movement 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.770
 creating that light volume that everyone 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.350
 we like it if what you want is a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.910
 100% straight hair then spent the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.730
 brush perfectly from the root 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.830
 until the tips comb my fringe with 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.020
 the brush analyzing it up to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 Through the heat I will achieve volume and 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.430
 create the natural waves that so much 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.920
 like finally I'll fix it with cold air 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.520
 same that will allow my change to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.580
 hold in place 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.600
 dry and ready my hair frizz 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.150
 beautiful no 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.340
 once dry I will select my hair 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.140
 again dividing the top 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.800
 from the bottom as we did 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.850
 previously doing a half tail 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.950
 subject to my hair again with the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.740
 pinza and I leave the hand the section that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.860
 reese I will do next I will use my 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.510
 turbo hit dog of 5 I love it because 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.720
 It has different thicknesses for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.940
 different effects I will use the 32 and 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 the same 25 millimeters that I 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.910
 allow you to create waves in that and much more 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.870
 open to use the ferro is 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.330
 very important to use the glove of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.850
 Synthetic fibers do not worry this 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.830
 well in your kit the hill reaches 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.450
 very high temperatures that can call 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 your hair and in an oversight to your skin 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.580
 so be very careful to fit the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.710
 dog you just have to notice that the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.819
 two arrows match and after 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.129
 listen to a click will be ready 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.799
 connect it and raise the temperature 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.129
 want to use with my hair is 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.319
 slim it would raise it to 180 degrees it would take 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.139
 approximately 5 centimeters of hair 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.139
 and entangle it by tensioning it very well 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.549
 until you reach the tip it has become tangled 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.609
 turn the handle of the ferro with direction 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.889
 to my head and I count 10 to 20 seconds 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.380
 this will depend on the intensity of the curl 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.380
 that you want to get 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.960
 once ready to push with my other hand 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.330
 the curl down and the same of the other 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.460
 side although in this case apply a little 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.670
 of spray or spray so that the wave 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.709
 is defined much more will help me from the comb 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.840
 to straighten it and place the lock of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.410
 hair in the ferro starting at 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.430
 central part towards the tips 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.030
 again the handle towards the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.030
 head and we have 10 to 20 seconds 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.620
 I love these waves really are 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.900
 much more defined but without being 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.120
 Caireles or wrist curls that all 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.909
 more hits the reality is that the dog 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 It leaves super natural waves and very 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:47.090
 stylized for today 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.670
 as you can see it is not complicated 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.650
 you, like me, will perform the 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.710
 same steps of dividing the hair for 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.990
 curl it remember it very careful with 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.720
 use very high temperatures and take 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.400
 the ferro without protection I recommend them 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.889
 Do not undo the hair areas until 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.900
 fix them with a little spray once 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.580
 at room temperature if you catch the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.580
 words the wave as natural as possible 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.060
 you will love your hair as much as I 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.660
 this to the other tutorials that I'm 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.660
 preparing for you do not miss them
