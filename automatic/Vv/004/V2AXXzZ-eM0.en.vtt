00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.380
 to me 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.030
 the best exercises for pecs 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.820
 to stimulate the chest with weights there 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.290
 Two ways the opening price if 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 you want to work most of the 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.670
 chest in your workouts the key 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.800
 is in the pull movements though 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.809
 the openings can have their place of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.050
 once in a while the movements are 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.390
 pressing when their strength is greatest 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.520
 the more weight you can move through 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.440
 of the range of motion plus fibers 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.900
 muscle is recruited there is no 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 absolutely no substitute for the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.700
 heavy press with press bars with 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.190
 Dumbbells and grip hook openings 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.530
 Crossings of pulleys and cables do not have to 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.590
 remove them from the routine are left for 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.470
 use them in moderation 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.660
 flat bench press with bar price 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.640
 tilted will shift more attention to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.790
 the upper region of the chest while 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.350
 that the declined do the opposite 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.750
 shifts attention to the region 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.570
 bottom outside the flat bench pre 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.479
 works the top and bottom by 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.729
 I still highly recommend a 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.150
 presenting as part of your routine 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.920
 chest bench press dumbbell the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.780
 main advantage it has over the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.300
 bar is that they allow the movement 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.369
 be more natural helping to prevent 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.290
 Shoulder injuries also prevent it from 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.420
 produce imbalances in the force 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.460
 because you can not fool yourself by doing more 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.410
 strength with one arm that with another the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.409
 only drawback is that you can not 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.100
 lift so much weight 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.530
 funds make sure to use more grip 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.420
 wide and lean forward to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.609
 change the attention of the sad to the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 pectorals if the body weight is not 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.990
 enough then you can always 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.679
 add weight using the weight belt 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.000
 the funds are a compound movement 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.290
 excellent for breast development 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.260
 in general 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.270
 Dumbbell openings a movement 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.550
 of insulation for the chest that does not 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 allows a lot of weight lifting and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.360
 limits of muscle overload in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 general there is no more effective lift 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.740
 for breast development but can 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.260
 used occasionally for the variety 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.630
 and to maintain interest I would make sure 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.610
 of saving this to the end in order 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 to save the greatest strength of the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.460
 large compound movements like 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.280
 press and funds 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.620
 crosses with cable basically one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.630
 opening of foot more or less the same 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.170
 idea that the flat opening with 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.750
 dumbbells and not the most effective exercise 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.580
 fekter places a lot of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
 stress on the shoulders and does not allow 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.610
 breast overload if you want more 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.630
