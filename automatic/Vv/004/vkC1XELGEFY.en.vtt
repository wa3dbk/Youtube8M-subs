00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 this is about reliable and durable clean energy storage is 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.229
 try to save fuel and eliminate pollution 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:13.139
 it's about replacing the old with the new even though our solutions are 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.399
 technologically advanced the principles are really easy to 

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.399
 understand this engine is the heart of the system 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 stores kinetic energy in the form of a voting mass 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.659
 levitating on magnetic supports 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.659
 allowing the system to be regulated according to the demand 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.680
 effectively 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.350
 Delivering reliable efficient energy, high power discharges and virtually 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.110
 no need for maintenance 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.710
 at the beginning of this technology it was commented using it in transportation 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.720
 public in the so-called turns buses the turn buses a motor bus 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.640
 electric driven by an inertial battery 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 With current technology, museum tours can post fliers of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.370
 inertia that rotate at 100 thousand revolutions per minute beating batteries 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 conventional electric and even hydrogen cells 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.009
 they are currently used on a large scale in the area of ​​cargo transportation 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.390
 for the great contribution of energy needed in a short time 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 saving fuel by improving air quality and at the same time 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 increasing productivity 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 a reality that many shareholders are considering 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.310
 the other current applications of the inertial battery are trains 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.510
 storing the energy of the braking stage using the later by 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.320
 example to meet the peak demand at the time of the start of another train 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.170
 but the most popular battery market inertial systems in 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.060
 emergence of the different institutions 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 how can a data center be a hospital a steel factory a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 plastic processing plant the old lead-acid battery systems and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.030
 Acid requiring replacement continued are costly and can fail without prior 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.810
 notice 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.750
 the inertial battery system does not require any maintenance and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.360
 has a useful life of more than 20 years does not have any kind of waste or 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.830
 contains toxic or dangerous materials the inertial battery a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.350
 high price-quality ratio system saving space 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 predictability and immediate use 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.720
 mmm we can not produce all the energy with in the one 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.330
 because as time is variable we have to make it constant 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.250
 similarly veiga accumulate wind energy on a large scale 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.299
 pump water to a certain height convert it into water although potential energy and 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.650
 then take advantage of star energy to produce hydraulic energies to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.209
 then let's see tomorrow not to name in the commonwealth min what 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.220
 to observe is a boiler 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.310
 r elizarán on the land last Saturday since to produce electric power 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.909
 nothing at all we have water at the end durán for agriculture in the area
