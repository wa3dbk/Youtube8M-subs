consequence<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.210> most<00:00:54.510> matches

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

and<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> few<00:00:55.829> rounds<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.460> haven't<00:00:57.239> completed

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and in a few rounds I haven't completed

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
and in a few rounds I haven't completed
a<00:00:57.750> full<00:00:57.960> match<00:00:58.170> since<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> recent<00:00:58.920> update<00:00:59.460> we

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

a full match since the recent update we
don't<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> way<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> express<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> valve
