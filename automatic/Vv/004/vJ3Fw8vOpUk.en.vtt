and yes I have changed my set I was

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.279 
and yes I have changed my set I was
using<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> variation<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.300> blue<00:00:18.510> ninja<00:00:18.750> sliders

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
using a variation of blue ninja sliders

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
using a variation of blue ninja sliders
from<00:00:19.380> Operation<00:00:19.949> sports<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> long<00:00:20.760> time

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
from Operation sports for a long time

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.929 
from Operation sports for a long time
and<00:00:21.330> then<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> reverted<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and then I reverted to use what not a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
and then I reverted to use what not a
span<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:24.630> uses<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.560> set

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
span actually uses and I use that set

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
span actually uses and I use that set
right<00:00:25.890> after<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> Patriots<00:00:26.939> game<00:00:27.029> I'm

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
right after the Patriots game I'm

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
right after the Patriots game I'm
getting<00:00:27.869> two<00:00:28.080> lowest<00:00:28.320> scores<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.010> old

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
getting two lowest scores with the old

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.710 
getting two lowest scores with the old
slider<00:00:29.519> set<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> running<00:00:30.330> game<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
slider set and the running game for the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
slider set and the running game for the
computer<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.199> non-existent<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
computer was non-existent and so I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
computer was non-existent and so I
change<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> sliders<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.469> tweaking<00:00:34.980> them

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
change the sliders and I'm tweaking them

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.459 
change the sliders and I'm tweaking them
along<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> way<00:00:35.579> very<00:00:36.300> minimally<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> can

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
along the way very minimally but you can

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
along the way very minimally but you can
see<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.430> scores<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
see here with some of these scores that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
see here with some of these scores that
I'm<00:00:39.090> getting<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.629> better<00:00:39.930> games<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I'm getting a lot better games and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
I'm getting a lot better games and
granted<00:00:41.399> maybe<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> little

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
granted maybe some of them are a little

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.790 
granted maybe some of them are a little
higher<00:00:42.480> scoring<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> average<00:00:43.500> scores

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
higher scoring and the average scores

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.990 
higher scoring and the average scores
are<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.100> bit<00:00:44.190> higher<00:00:44.399> than<00:00:44.579> you'd<00:00:44.730> like

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
are a little bit higher than you'd like

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.819 
are a little bit higher than you'd like
but<00:00:45.329> I'd<00:00:45.510> rather<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.649> too

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
but I'd rather have a little bit too

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
but I'd rather have a little bit too
high<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.149> low<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.719> guys<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
has to be equivalent to the computer so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.990 
has to be equivalent to the computer so
if<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.210> 22<00:01:54.689> computer<00:01:55.290> accuracy<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.490> 22

to<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.729> side<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> same<00:02:01.079> tweak<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to one side I make the same tweak to the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
to one side I make the same tweak to the
other<00:02:01.890> side<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.909> buy<00:02:03.149> into<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.540> theory

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
other side and I buy into this theory

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.020 
other side and I buy into this theory
because<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> idea<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.700> keeping

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because I like the idea of keeping

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.080 
because I like the idea of keeping
things<00:02:06.180> balanced<00:02:06.810> special<00:02:07.649> teams<00:02:07.910> first<00:02:08.910> of

things balanced special teams first of
all<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:09.599> back<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.020> show<00:02:10.200> you

all I'm gonna go back here to show you
guys<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:10.709> things<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.069> different

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
guys some things that are different

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
guys some things that are different
obviously<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.599> you've<00:02:12.720> watched

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
obviously you know if you've watched

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670 
obviously you know if you've watched
some<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> games

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
some the games

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
some the games
only<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.180> running<00:02:15.480> game<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.629> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
only that the the running game for the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.449 
only that the the running game for the
computer<00:02:16.200> isn't<00:02:16.319> pretty<00:02:16.680> powerful<00:02:17.219> so<00:02:17.370> I've

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
computer isn't pretty powerful so I've

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.190 
computer isn't pretty powerful so I've
been<00:02:17.579> tweaking<00:02:17.879> run<00:02:18.269> blocking<00:02:18.569> taking<00:02:19.109> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
been tweaking run blocking taking it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
been tweaking run blocking taking it
down<00:02:19.379> what<00:02:19.829> I<00:02:19.859> do<00:02:19.980> usually<00:02:20.609> is<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.000> will<00:02:21.180> only

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
down what I do usually is I will only

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.199 
down what I do usually is I will only
I'll<00:02:21.840> do<00:02:22.109> very<00:02:22.500> slight<00:02:22.980> tweaks<00:02:23.370> after<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> few

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I'll do very slight tweaks after a few

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.119 
I'll do very slight tweaks after a few
games<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.750> saw<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.379> running<00:02:25.769> game<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
games I saw the running game for the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.589 
games I saw the running game for the
computer<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.579> really<00:02:26.790> strong<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.359> what<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.510> did

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
computer was really strong so what I did

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.559 
computer was really strong so what I did
is<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.930> put<00:02:27.959> run<00:02:28.439> blocking<00:02:28.950> down<00:02:29.219> like<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.909> for

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
is I put run blocking down like one for

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.800 
is I put run blocking down like one for
each<00:02:30.689> side<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.230> did<00:02:31.829> rush<00:02:32.760> defense<00:02:33.090> reaction

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
each side I did rush defense reaction

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.869 
each side I did rush defense reaction
time<00:02:33.959> plus<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.680> each<00:02:34.859> side<00:02:34.889> and<00:02:35.519> now<00:02:35.790> I'm

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
time plus one on each side and now I'm

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.250 
time plus one on each side and now I'm
just<00:02:36.060> trying<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.450> how<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.659> gets<00:02:37.079> me<00:02:37.230> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
just trying to see how that gets me I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.110 
just trying to see how that gets me I
want<00:02:37.469> to<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.650> too<00:02:37.889> big<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.250> changes<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
want to make too big of changes and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.089 
want to make too big of changes and
throw<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.420> off<00:02:39.540> balance<00:02:39.959> even<00:02:40.170> further<00:02:40.349> so<00:02:41.069> I

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
throw it off balance even further so I

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.259 
throw it off balance even further so I
feel<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.609> pretty<00:02:41.849> good<00:02:42.090> game

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
feel like I have a pretty good game

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.759 
feel like I have a pretty good game
going<00:02:42.599> right<00:02:42.750> now<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:42.959> I'ma<00:02:43.170> take<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.500> slow

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
going right now and I'ma take it slow

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.890 
going right now and I'ma take it slow
and<00:02:43.889> continue<00:02:44.340> tweaking<00:02:44.639> but<00:02:44.969> hopefully<00:02:45.389> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and continue tweaking but hopefully you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.089 
and continue tweaking but hopefully you
guys<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.079> see<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:46.590> settings<00:02:46.829> here

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
guys can see all these settings here

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.589 
guys can see all these settings here
it's<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.310> same<00:02:47.549> computer<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.150> user<00:02:48.329> have<00:02:48.569> to

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
it's the same computer and user have to

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.020 
it's the same computer and user have to
be<00:02:48.840> equivalent<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.709> now<00:02:50.549> here<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.909> the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
special team Slayers that I currently

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.830 
special team Slayers that I currently
play<00:02:52.500> with<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.340> don't<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> set<00:02:54.659> here

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
play with I don't really have a set here

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.920 
play with I don't really have a set here
that<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.349> all<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.709> much<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.659> gets

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that I like all that much but it gets

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.629 
that I like all that much but it gets
the<00:02:58.049> job<00:02:58.260> done<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.620> want<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.010> see<00:02:59.159> more<00:02:59.370> missed

if<00:03:51.870> they<00:03:51.959> were<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.229> previous<00:03:52.349> games<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:52.919> I've

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
if they were in previous games but I've

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.619 
if they were in previous games but I've
done<00:03:53.400> some<00:03:53.669> digging<00:03:53.699> in<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.150> operation

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
done some digging in the operation

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.569 
done some digging in the operation
sports<00:03:54.900> forums<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.709> I've<00:03:56.099> come<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.430> realize

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
sports forums and I've come to realize

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.420 
sports forums and I've come to realize
or<00:03:57.479> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:58.229> it's<00:03:58.439> true<00:03:58.620> anyway<00:03:58.949> but<00:03:59.189> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
or I think it's true anyway but I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.740 
or I think it's true anyway but I
believe<00:04:00.419> penalties<00:04:00.959> do<00:04:01.859> affect<00:04:02.370> gameplay

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
believe penalties do affect gameplay

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.300 
believe penalties do affect gameplay
stuff<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:04.040> defensive<00:04:05.040> pass<00:04:05.280> interference

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
stuff like defensive pass interference

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.939 
stuff like defensive pass interference
it<00:04:06.120> kind<00:04:06.329> of<00:04:06.419> if<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.290> look<00:04:07.409> at<00:04:07.560> operation

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
it kind of if you look at operation

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:08.869 
it kind of if you look at operation
sports<00:04:08.189> they<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.400> some<00:04:08.519> really<00:04:08.669> good

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
sports they have some really good

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.429 
sports they have some really good
threads<00:04:09.239> on<00:04:09.419> these<00:04:09.599> settings<00:04:10.049> here<00:04:10.259> and

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
threads on these settings here and

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.679 
threads on these settings here and
basically<00:04:11.250> like<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:12.060> philosophy<00:04:12.540> behind

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
basically like the philosophy behind

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.390 
basically like the philosophy behind
having<00:04:12.989> defensive<00:04:13.530> pass<00:04:13.709> interference<00:04:13.739> high

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
having defensive pass interference high

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.370 
having defensive pass interference high
is<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.269> defensive<00:04:15.930> back<00:04:16.079> will<00:04:16.259> play

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
is that the defensive back will play

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.099 
is that the defensive back will play
higher<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.130> more<00:04:17.699> aggressive<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
higher and more aggressive to the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.599 
higher and more aggressive to the
receiver<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.859> they'll<00:04:19.949> be<00:04:20.099> sticking<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
receiver and they'll be sticking to a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.850 
receiver and they'll be sticking to a
little<00:04:20.849> bit<00:04:20.940> better<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.389> they'll<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.409> play

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
little bit better and they'll just play

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.469 
little bit better and they'll just play
a<00:04:22.889> little<00:04:23.070> bit<00:04:23.159> smarter<00:04:23.639> but<00:04:23.909> you<00:04:24.060> also<00:04:24.210> don't

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
a little bit smarter but you also don't

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.400 
a little bit smarter but you also don't
want<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.630> make<00:04:24.779> sure<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.169> too<00:04:25.740> high

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
want to make sure it's too high

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.250 
want to make sure it's too high
at<00:04:26.620> 99<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.220> only<00:04:27.370> got<00:04:27.520> one<00:04:27.550> higher<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.360> these

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
at 99 you only got one higher but these
