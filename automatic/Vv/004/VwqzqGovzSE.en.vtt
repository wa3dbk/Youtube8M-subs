00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.130 
same direction so this is going to be
folded<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.370> half<00:02:16.519> towards<00:02:16.970> me<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.720> we're<00:02:18.019> just

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
folded in half towards me and we're just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.420 
folded in half towards me and we're just
gonna<00:02:18.380> stack<00:02:18.890> these<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.220> top<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:20.870> each<00:02:20.989> other

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
gonna stack these on top of each other

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.860 
gonna stack these on top of each other
there's<00:02:22.430> no<00:02:23.650> special<00:02:24.650> way<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.870> keep

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
there's no special way just keep

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.000 
there's no special way just keep
stacking<00:02:27.560> them<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.250> middle<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:30.440> by<00:02:30.680> one

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
stacking them in the middle one by one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.890 
stacking them in the middle one by one
on<00:02:31.310> top<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.640> each<00:02:32.000> other<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.930> might<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.380> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
on top of each other you might have to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.170 
on top of each other you might have to
go<00:02:35.900> from<00:02:36.500> one<00:02:36.680> side<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.310> next<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:37.910> they<00:02:38.030> can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
go from one side to the next so they can

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.729 
go from one side to the next so they can
all<00:02:38.299> stay<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.750> there<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.319> as<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.380> can<00:02:42.590> see

we're forming a pattern then we got two

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.960 
we're forming a pattern then we got two
wrong<00:02:48.380> we're<00:02:48.590> gonna<00:02:48.709> fold<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.970> and
