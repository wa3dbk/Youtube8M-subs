00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you see that that code there I thought

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.220 
you see that that code there I thought
it<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.330> actual<00:01:45.420> pass<00:01:45.780> itself

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230
