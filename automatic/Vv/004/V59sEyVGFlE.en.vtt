00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 the first half I take the moment when 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 gaming is better bill it when spartak 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.550
 the game is better some periods we had 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.360
 just one good point just feed 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 Embaevo we give a bar to that mind I was 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.980
 Spartacus had a very good moment 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.070
 very good point Intermedia council their 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 I can say that the first half hips 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.610
 maybe they beat a bit dangerous then 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 we take them a couple of blows that miss 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.079
 booker in the second half and I think that is not 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.170
 believed it was better to start the soul played to her 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.659
 could score wander goal can say 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.309
 better good time and could score everything 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:01:02.969
 there after filing with you when mikhalik not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 I got shaggy, but we have taken asleep 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.550
 opportunities to counterattack and so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.250
 I think that well deserved 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.159
 players they did well and think 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.600
 miller today because big hotels 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.600
 more than spartak 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.470
 no i think 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.010
 just white that Spartak passed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 most of the breed we have opened 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.390
 free just spilled so they 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
 fed on 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.880
 loads the ball on jubba from how to find it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.820
 him in the support zone 7 intercept the ball 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 then we had a very big 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 space therefore players ran 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 a period of slightly big dope powers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.540
 felt it just felt 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.540
 that they think most of them 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.680
 as long as we know have to do 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.950
 medical examination there because here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.560
 system in the mornings and everything on foot 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.100
 ankle he complains about originate but 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.100
 take a look 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.439
 yes and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.549
 and scattered goals came back 2 days 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.620
 before playing with a sofa 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.379
 against and I put the place 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.599
 games with now and yes work your drill with 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.280
 us and I think that today for me 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.269
 to be the best player to such you him 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.750
 if not the best hotels rumors if 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:53.670
 i will choose the best 3 today this 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.670
 never do kasaev fight and blueberries 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.930
 situation you suggest 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.680
 thought that it would be a central game 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.130
 protector 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.510
 because there are other Spartacus how many 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.900
 us information from then he played 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.750
 central birth well and counties 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.520
 england okay miss wanted to 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.610
 more gravel on this side because 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.580
 concerns you and its very good 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.110
 Stroke but generally the first 20 minutes 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.760
 the first half did not work 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.150
 the translation is just peace in general its time 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.040
 there by our right fact not lifting on 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.790
 breakthrough also said to play more well 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 I think that he is very small today from 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.250
 shame to Kasaev, we are all better pleased
