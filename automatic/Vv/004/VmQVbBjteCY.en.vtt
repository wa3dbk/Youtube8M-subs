done so i decided to do a bit of
research<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:53.030> particular<00:00:54.199> phenomenon<00:00:55.199> I

something I was looking into and I was
trying<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> work<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.750> why<00:01:46.500> I've<00:01:46.890> been<00:01:47.250> doing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
trying to work out why I've been doing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
trying to work out why I've been doing
it<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.180> recently<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.689> I've<00:01:48.810> been<00:01:48.960> putting

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
off work much more as of recently and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
off work much more as of recently and
there<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
there are kind of two things I've put it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560 
there are kind of two things I've put it
down<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.619> actually<00:01:56.219> being<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
down to one of them actually being that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
down to one of them actually being that
I've<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.049> been<00:01:58.259> training<00:01:58.860> as<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.549> my

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
I've not been training as much for my

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880 
I've not been training as much for my
swimming<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> time<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> can

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
swimming and that's a time when I can

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
swimming and that's a time when I can
you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> declutter<00:02:02.939> my<00:02:03.090> thoughts<00:02:03.509> sort<00:02:03.810> them

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you know declutter my thoughts sort them

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
you know declutter my thoughts sort them
out<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.590> process<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:06.570> time<00:02:06.750> when

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
out you know process them just time when

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.260 
out you know process them just time when
I'm<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.170> focusing<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:08.009> anything<00:02:08.310> health<00:02:09.000> too

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
I'm not focusing on anything health too

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
I'm not focusing on anything health too
much<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.170> sort<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.920> what's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
much and I can just sort out what's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.910 
much and I can just sort out what's
going<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.750> into<00:02:12.900> order

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
going on with that and put it into order

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.470 
going on with that and put it into order
then<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:14.790> brain<00:02:15.030> isn't<00:02:15.180> being

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
then you know my brain isn't being

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.320 
then you know my brain isn't being
cognitively<00:02:16.470> exhausted<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.880> know<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.150> day

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
cognitively exhausted you know all day

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.089 
cognitively exhausted you know all day
long<00:02:18.510> I've<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.720> kind<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.020> put<00:02:19.560> things<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:20.040> of

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
long I've just kind of put things out of

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.220 
long I've just kind of put things out of
the<00:02:20.280> way<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:21.300> getting<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.720> right<00:02:21.959> kind

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the way so it's getting the right kind

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.010 
the way so it's getting the right kind
of<00:02:22.349> mindset<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.849> actually<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.540> turns<00:02:24.660> out

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
of mindset and actually as it turns out

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.410 
of mindset and actually as it turns out
i<00:02:25.080> found<00:02:25.440> an<00:02:25.650> equation<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.790> explains

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
i found an equation which explains

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
i found an equation which explains
procrastination<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.560> motivation<00:02:29.310> which<00:02:29.819> at

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
procrastination or motivation which at

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.120 
procrastination or motivation which at
first<00:02:30.030> i<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.380> work<00:02:31.560> but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
first i was like how can that work but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.620 
first i was like how can that work but
it<00:02:32.190> actually<00:02:32.340> makes<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.850> lot<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.030> sense<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
it actually makes a lot of sense the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.860 
it actually makes a lot of sense the
equation<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.560> expectancy<00:02:35.489> x<00:02:36.030> value<00:02:36.480> 0<00:02:36.510> for

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
equation is expectancy x value 0 for

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.080 
equation is expectancy x value 0 for
impulsive<00:02:37.380> nurse<00:02:37.620> x<00:02:37.920> delay<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
impulsive nurse x delay so the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.050 
impulsive nurse x delay so the
expectancy<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.100> basically<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.580> know<00:02:41.700> what

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
expectancy is basically you know what

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.309 
expectancy is basically you know what
you<00:02:42.180> expect<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:43.080> success<00:02:43.590> then<00:02:44.160> you're

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
you expect of your success then you're

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.210 
you expect of your success then you're
kind<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.350> what<00:02:46.530> you're<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:47.010> from

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
kind of what you're going to get from

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.820 
kind of what you're going to get from
completing<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.790> task<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.750> value<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
completing a task then the value is you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.130 
completing a task then the value is you
know<00:02:49.920> how<00:02:50.100> enjoyable<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.850> task<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.450> often

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
know how enjoyable the task is often

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.809 
know how enjoyable the task is often
it's<00:02:52.350> not<00:02:52.530> very<00:02:52.739> valuable<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.700> what

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
it's not very valuable don't know what

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.100 
it's not very valuable don't know what
i'm<00:02:53.910> doing<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> floor<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> game<00:02:54.870> there

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
i'm doing on the floor in the game there

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.809 
i'm doing on the floor in the game there
but<00:02:55.530> often<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.459> know<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.610> very

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
but often it's not you know a very

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.340 
but often it's not you know a very
valuable<00:02:57.180> task<00:02:57.569> if<00:02:57.840> you're<00:02:57.959> putting<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.260> off

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
valuable task if you're putting it off

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.500 
valuable task if you're putting it off
then<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.250> divide<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.549> by<00:02:59.850> impulsive<00:03:00.120> nurse

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
then you divide that by impulsive nurse

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.970 
then you divide that by impulsive nurse
which<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:00.900> how<00:03:01.080> impulsive<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.680> are<00:03:01.799> how

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
which is just how impulsive you are how

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.259 
which is just how impulsive you are how
motivated<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
motivated you are that's you know a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.479 
motivated you are that's you know a
constant<00:03:03.810> thing<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.380> then<00:03:04.739> also<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.190> delay

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
constant thing and then also the delay

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.430 
constant thing and then also the delay
the<00:03:05.700> time<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.239> take<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the time it would take to get the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.190 
the time it would take to get the
rewards<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.760> often<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.360> school<00:03:09.660> work<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
rewards and often with school work you

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.170 
rewards and often with school work you
know<00:03:10.319> essays<00:03:10.739> papers<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.910> kind<00:03:12.120> of

the rewards from very quickly you know
you'll<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.640> on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> sunday<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.600> it'll<00:03:19.049> get

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you'll do it on the sunday and it'll get

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.539 
you'll do it on the sunday and it'll get
marked<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.709> know<00:03:19.799> by<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> end<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> week

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
marked you know by the end of the week

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.920 
marked you know by the end of the week
and<00:03:20.760> you'll<00:03:20.850> get<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.030> mark<00:03:21.299> back<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and you'll get the mark back then and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.229 
and you'll get the mark back then and
you<00:03:22.440> know<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> kind<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.920> disjoint<00:03:23.489> sit<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
you know it kind of disjoint sit so a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.270 
you know it kind of disjoint sit so a
way<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.660> increase<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:27.650> or<00:03:28.650> decrease<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
way to increase the the or decrease the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.090 
way to increase the the or decrease the
delay<00:03:29.549> or<00:03:29.579> increase<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.570> expectancy<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.530> to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
delay or increase the expectancy is to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.770 
delay or increase the expectancy is to
basically<00:03:32.310> reward<00:03:32.910> yourself<00:03:33.030> while<00:03:33.600> you're

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
basically reward yourself while you're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
basically reward yourself while you're
doing<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.560> task<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> whatever<00:03:35.820> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
doing the task you know whatever it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.750 
doing the task you know whatever it
might<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:37.890> whether<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.519> break

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
might be you know whether it's a break

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.009 
might be you know whether it's a break
whether<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.510> having<00:03:39.840> something

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
whether it's you know having something

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.110 
whether it's you know having something
to<00:03:40.320> eat<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.890> know<00:03:40.980> something<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
to eat you know something like that and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.400 
to eat you know something like that and
that's<00:03:42.329> actually<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.630> lot<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.840> stuff<00:03:43.019> related

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
that's actually a lot of stuff related

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.430 
that's actually a lot of stuff related
to<00:03:43.590> energy<00:03:44.209> there<00:03:45.209> also<00:03:45.570> impacts<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> lot<00:03:46.290> a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
to energy there also impacts a lot a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.050 
to energy there also impacts a lot a
while<00:03:46.799> ago<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:47.160> long<00:03:47.370> time<00:03:47.579> ago<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.790> did<00:03:48.030> a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
while ago a long time ago I did a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
while ago a long time ago I did a
commentary<00:03:48.390> where<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.630> actually<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:49.140> talking

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
commentary where I actually was talking

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.949 
commentary where I actually was talking
about<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.010> impact<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.579> glucose<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.570> blood

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
about the impact of glucose and blood

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.199 
about the impact of glucose and blood
glucose<00:03:52.290> concentration<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.220> energy<00:03:53.910> levels

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
glucose concentration on energy levels

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.490 
glucose concentration on energy levels
and<00:03:54.329> how<00:03:54.450> if<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.750> actually<00:03:54.900> keep<00:03:55.170> your<00:03:55.320> blood

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
and how if you actually keep your blood

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.590 
and how if you actually keep your blood
glucose<00:03:55.859> level<00:03:56.160> high<00:03:56.340> your<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.299> know<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.510> able

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
glucose level high your you know be able

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.059 
glucose level high your you know be able
to<00:03:57.780> work<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.230> much<00:03:58.440> better<00:03:58.709> rate<00:03:58.890> you'll<00:03:59.040> be

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
to work it a much better rate you'll be

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.309 
to work it a much better rate you'll be
much<00:03:59.250> more<00:03:59.310> motivated<00:04:00.299> but<00:04:00.750> obviously<00:04:01.079> you

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
much more motivated but obviously you

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.780 
much more motivated but obviously you
know<00:04:01.440> just<00:04:01.650> eat<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.040> loads<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.310> sweets<00:04:02.609> you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
know just eat and loads of sweets you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.130 
know just eat and loads of sweets you
know<00:04:02.910> you'll<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.480> effect<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> few

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
know you'll have that effect for a few

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.720 
know you'll have that effect for a few
minutes<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.250> plummet<00:04:05.519> and

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
minutes and then it will plummet and

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.890 
minutes and then it will plummet and
you'll<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> opposite<00:04:06.390> effect<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.780> your

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
you'll have the opposite effect is your

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.199 
you'll have the opposite effect is your
blood<00:04:07.049> glucose<00:04:07.739> level<00:04:08.040> will<00:04:08.160> drop<00:04:08.209> quite

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
blood glucose level will drop quite

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.640 
blood glucose level will drop quite
significantly<00:04:09.840> down<00:04:10.049> your<00:04:10.230> blood<00:04:10.410> sugar

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
significantly down your blood sugar

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.330 
significantly down your blood sugar
level<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.069> is<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.560> basically<00:04:13.709> says

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
level that is so what it basically says

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
level that is so what it basically says
and<00:04:14.549> also<00:04:14.850> sleep<00:04:15.209> I've<00:04:15.510> been<00:04:15.989> getting<00:04:16.229> Leslie

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
and also sleep I've been getting Leslie

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.349 
and also sleep I've been getting Leslie
recently<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.669> think<00:04:17.880> that's<00:04:18.060> another

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
recently and I think that's another

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.140 
recently and I think that's another
reason<00:04:18.630> I've<00:04:19.019> been<00:04:19.049> procrastinating<00:04:19.850> more<00:04:20.850> so

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
reason I've been procrastinating more so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510 
reason I've been procrastinating more so
you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.169> things<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.680> usually<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.070> found

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you know things that usually I found

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.219 
you know things that usually I found
would<00:04:24.360> help<00:04:24.539> with<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.020> them<00:04:25.140> I

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
would help with this one of them I

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.440 
would help with this one of them I
started<00:04:25.560> using<00:04:25.740> before<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.700> even<00:04:26.789> started

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
started using before I even started

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.330 
started using before I even started
looking<00:04:27.660> at<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.290> to-do<00:04:28.770> list<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.190> have

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
looking at it was a to-do list I have

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.700 
looking at it was a to-do list I have
that<00:04:29.520> on<00:04:29.670> my<00:04:29.700> iPhone<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.450> little<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.590> know

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
that on my iPhone a little you know

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.410 
that on my iPhone a little you know
remind<00:04:32.010> this<00:04:32.190> list<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.940> can<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.150> take

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
remind this list and I can just take

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.880 
remind this list and I can just take
things<00:04:33.630> off<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.020> can<00:04:34.200> just<00:04:34.320> get<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.590> visual

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
things off I can just get a visual

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.860 
things off I can just get a visual
representation<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:36.150> what<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.390> need<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.630> get

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
representation of what I need to get

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.630 
representation of what I need to get
done<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.350> order<00:04:37.500> them<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.890> terms<00:04:38.490> of

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
done I can order them in terms of

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.390 
done I can order them in terms of
priority<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.560> get<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.740> things<00:04:40.980> done<00:04:41.100> I

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
priority and just get the things done I

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.160 
priority and just get the things done I
need<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.670> get<00:04:41.820> done<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.180> then<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.810> can<00:04:42.990> look

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
need to get done and then I can look

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.420 
need to get done and then I can look
back<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.410> think<00:04:43.620> right<00:04:43.980> what<00:04:44.130> did<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.340> achieve

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
back and think right what did I achieve

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.040 
back and think right what did I achieve
today<00:04:44.760> what<00:04:45.030> did<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.240> achieve<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.600> this<00:04:45.750> time

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
today what did I achieve in this time

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.870 
today what did I achieve in this time
and<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.710> know<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:47.040> kind<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.310> judge<00:04:47.640> myself

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
and you know I can kind of judge myself

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.940 
and you know I can kind of judge myself
