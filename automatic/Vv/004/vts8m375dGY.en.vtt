00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.420
 What we wanted was to include many 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 mythological locations give them the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.530
 opportunity to explore the reasons why 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.360
 those who kratos broke his tie with the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.930

 you will find slow moments and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 intense that will make you reflect 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.829

 endings and incredible beings like 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.399
 titans where you're going to have to 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 face you there is no other game like there 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.670
 outside 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.420
 the camera system is one of the signs 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.039
 identity of all the games of 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.869
 ghost of war the idea is like in a 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.609
 movie record the blueprints for you and that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.109
 do not have to do what we try is 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.729
 of wrapping you completely in the 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.989
 scenes and you just have to 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.989
 focus on the action 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.159
 in each of the parties we have improved 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 everything the camera can reach 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.969
 do you really can see more things in 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 the scenes of what we have 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.660
 done before and at the end what we have 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.400
 created is a science of how it should 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.400
 record the shots of a video game 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.950
 the biggest added that we have 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.140
 extraregional combat of treatment is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.450
 the new fire rage system 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.070
 the more he fights, the more he fills his anger 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.320
 as players you do well what 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.760
 makes your attacks more powerful and 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.660
 in each of those struggles you can go 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 recharging that rage 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.850
 we also give you the possibility of power 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.800
 pick up weapons on the ground even in 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.260
 Sometimes you can disarm enemies and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.160
 use them against them so kratos 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.220
 he has more bad milk than ever 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 and if we add that in the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.910
 multiplayer you can create weapons 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.410
 used in the campaign we are facing the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.650
 god of war game in relation to the most 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 full 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.170
 the magnitude of this godÃ³ guard is enormous 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 in any area that you look 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 it's not that it's the size of a titan is 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.660
 that each scenario is titanic in itself 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.660
 and it will impact you 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.250
 each of the scenarios has its 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.319
 times very different locations and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.180
 specific that are each of them 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.180
 also amazing and memorable 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.360
 the truth is that I think the fans and the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.890
 new followers will be impacted 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.540
 for all these scenarios that we have 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.540
 created in ghost of war ascension 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.110
 in this game it certainly represents what 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.060
 best we can get PS3 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.880
 visual terms of feelings of 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.700
 size you have in campaign mode you have mode 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.650
 multiplayer now what we get is 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.510
 look forward to the challenge 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.220
 that is going to assume play station 4 in the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.620
 future for me as a fan be 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.510
 completely excited for wrapping me in 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 the experience to see it all a lot 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.530
 better and much bigger ultimately 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.040
 that is going to be amazing what can 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.040
 Present the future 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.959
