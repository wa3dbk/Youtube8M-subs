00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.320
 about 15 meters above the river 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.809
 clyde in scotia is the bridge or berth 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.270
 also known as the bridge of the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.789
 suicide dogs place in which since 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.280
 More than 60 years ago by dogs 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.760
 there they pass surprisingly 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.760
 they throw to the emptiness 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.580
 this strange phenomenon started from 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.220
 of the 50s and it lasts until our 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.530
 days one of the strangest facts is 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.050
 that dogs that do not die in the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.050
 first jump startlingly they return to 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.780
 go up and jump again many have 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.300
 attributed the strange event to forces and 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.670
 paranormal phenomena to the existence 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.739
 of magnetic fields or energies 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.030
 unknown and hidden between the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.190
 rocks 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.320
 however veterinarians were performed 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 studies and determined that given the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.330
 characteristics of the bridge the sharpness 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.970
 visual of dogs is reduced and its 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.510
 sense of smell is more acute and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.510
 powerful 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.079
 they also discovered that there were some 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.189
 races more likely to jump 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.310
 especially those of the hunters of 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.280
 big snout like farmers polis and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.350
 golden retrievers finally found 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.780
 that in the region below the bridge and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.640
 On the banks of the river, certain 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 characteristic animals of the area 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.939
 such as the American animal mink that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.020
 It settled there in the late 50 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.970
 precisely when they started 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.880
 register the first suicides 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.799
 dog, the mink has glands that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.560
 they secrete substances with a very 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.259
 powerful which drives mad and catches 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 dogs who try at all costs 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.610
 mark your territory 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 as the bridge makes the river have 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.950
 small channel lacking any type 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.380
 of streams the substance is concentrated 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.079
 and the smell is stronger so the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.819
 dogs decide to throw themselves into the void to go 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.759
 in your search without knowing that 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.799
 they will probably find death this 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.049
 explanation has been the most recent 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.330
 provided by science and has left 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.640
 the most skeptical satisfied without 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 embargo for believers and fans 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.140
 of the paranormal the canine instinct by 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.690
 the mink hunt does not result 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.880
 all convincing especially when it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.019
 It's about dogs that jump in one and another 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.019
 time to die
