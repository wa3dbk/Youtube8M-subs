00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.880 

now<00:03:01.270> basically<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.870> connect<00:03:02.140> this<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:02.320> is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
now basically to connect this up is

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220 
now basically to connect this up is
fairly<00:03:03.490> straightforward<00:03:03.880> all<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.990> need<00:03:05.110> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
fairly straightforward all you need to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.460 
fairly straightforward all you need to
do<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:06.520> grab<00:03:06.880> these<00:03:07.090> cables<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:13.420> you'll<00:03:14.350> have

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
do is grab these cables and you'll have

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.580 
do is grab these cables and you'll have
your<00:03:14.560> left<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:14.980> right<00:03:15.810> plug<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.990> here<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.530> if

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
your left and right plug in here so if

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.350 
your left and right plug in here so if
we<00:03:17.650> put<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.980> one<00:03:18.160> into<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.520> L<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:19.180> left

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
we put that one into the L for left

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.880 
we put that one into the L for left
which<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:19.960> usually<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.350> one<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.740> put

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
which is usually the one that you put

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.650 
which is usually the one that you put
the<00:03:21.010> white<00:03:21.250> one<00:03:21.490> into<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:23.740> you've<00:03:23.920> got<00:03:24.070> a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
the white one into and then you've got a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.320 
the white one into and then you've got a
red<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.960> a<00:03:26.230> clear<00:03:26.500> cable<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.640> red<00:03:27.820> cable<00:03:28.060> will

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
red and a clear cable the red cable will

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.240 
red and a clear cable the red cable will
go<00:03:28.510> into<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.020> red<00:03:29.230> terminal<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.040> clear

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
go into the red terminal and the clear

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.000 
go into the red terminal and the clear
cable<00:03:30.580> will<00:03:30.670> go<00:03:30.760> into<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.060> black<00:03:31.240> terminal

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
cable will go into the black terminal

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.350 
cable will go into the black terminal
you<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.280> ensure<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.180> same

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
you have to ensure that this is the same

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.240 
you have to ensure that this is the same
on<00:03:34.540> both<00:03:34.690> sides<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.500> your<00:03:35.830> speakers<00:03:36.040> are

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
on both sides so that your speakers are

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.390 
on both sides so that your speakers are
in<00:03:36.460> polarity<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.650> was<00:03:38.830> our<00:03:38.980> left

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
in polarity and that was our left

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
in polarity and that was our left
speaker<00:03:40.020> it'll<00:03:41.020> go<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.960> you<00:03:43.960> do

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
speaker it'll go like that and you do

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.780 
speaker it'll go like that and you do
the<00:03:44.230> exact<00:03:44.440> same<00:03:44.470> thing<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.580> other

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the exact same thing with the other

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.090 
the exact same thing with the other
speaker<00:03:48.390> next<00:03:49.390> step<00:03:49.660> will<00:03:49.900> be<00:03:50.080> your<00:03:50.380> audio<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
speaker next step will be your audio to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.390 
speaker next step will be your audio to
cable<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.890> you've<00:03:54.010> got<00:03:54.100> your<00:03:54.220> volume

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
cable and then you've got your volume

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.850 
cable and then you've got your volume
controller

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.559 

which<00:04:00.860> simply<00:04:01.610> plugs<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.180> that's<00:04:02.420> a

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
which simply plugs in that's a

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.000 
which simply plugs in that's a
directional<00:04:03.050> cable<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.650> make<00:04:03.800> sure<00:04:03.830> you

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
directional cable so just make sure you

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280 
directional cable so just make sure you
give<00:04:04.129> that<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> right<00:04:04.519> way<00:04:04.670> around<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:06.050> goes

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
give that the right way around that goes

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.470 
give that the right way around that goes
in<00:04:06.500> like<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:09.760> now<00:04:10.760> you'll<00:04:10.910> see<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.269> front

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
in like so now you'll see on the front

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.780 
in like so now you'll see on the front
of<00:04:11.510> your<00:04:11.599> desk<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.800> last<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:13.280> not<00:04:13.370> least<00:04:13.610> your

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
of your desk and last but not least your

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.219 
of your desk and last but not least your
power<00:04:13.970> connection

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.360 

all<00:04:21.229> right<00:04:21.410> let's<00:04:21.620> pile<00:04:21.859> them<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.130> for<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
all right let's pile them up for the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.469 
all right let's pile them up for the
first<00:04:22.520> time<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.550> there<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:25.880> go<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.090> can<00:04:26.210> see

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
first time so there you go you can see

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.390 
first time so there you go you can see

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
levels going back you're gonna solve on

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.840 
levels going back you're gonna solve on
your<00:04:51.860> computer<00:04:52.190> already<00:04:52.280> you'll<00:04:52.550> be<00:04:52.639> able<00:04:52.729> to
