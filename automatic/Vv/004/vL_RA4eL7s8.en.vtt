not<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.530> products<00:00:41.220> we're<00:00:41.460> using<00:00:41.640> these

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
not so much products we're using these

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.790 
not so much products we're using these
samples<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.199> a<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.500> demonstrating

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
samples here as a way of demonstrating

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.280 
samples here as a way of demonstrating
the<00:00:44.430> technology<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.720> GBC<00:00:46.199> has

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
the technology but what GBC has

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.410 
the technology but what GBC has
developed<00:00:46.830> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> new<00:00:47.309> chip<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.270> will

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
developed is a new chip that will

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
developed is a new chip that will
process<00:00:49.010> high-speed<00:00:50.010> video<00:00:50.339> and

one<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.089> hang-ups<00:00:54.510> has<00:00:54.690> been<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.199> high

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
one of the hang-ups has been with high

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
one of the hang-ups has been with high
resolution<00:00:55.949> cameras<00:00:56.400> is<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.729> do<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:56.850> do

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
resolution cameras is what do you do

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
resolution cameras is what do you do
with<00:00:57.089> all<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> data<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.379> an<00:00:59.040> eight

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
with all the data you have an eight

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.640 
with all the data you have an eight
megapixel<00:00:59.489> or<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.150> 10<00:01:00.390> megapixel<00:01:00.540> camera<00:01:01.440> but

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
megapixel or a 10 megapixel camera but

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.469 
megapixel or a 10 megapixel camera but
and<00:01:01.830> that's<00:01:02.250> great<00:01:02.400> for<00:01:02.519> shooting<00:01:03.030> stills<00:01:03.300> but

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
and that's great for shooting stills but

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.260 
and that's great for shooting stills but
recording<00:01:04.110> 60<00:01:04.589> frames<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> second<00:01:05.580> has<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
recording 60 frames a second has been a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
recording 60 frames a second has been a
challenge<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.320> doing<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.860> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
challenge and what we're doing is we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.440 
challenge and what we're doing is we
have<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> chip<00:01:09.120> now<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.540> lsi<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> able<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
have a chip now an lsi that is able to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.520 
have a chip now an lsi that is able to
record<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> process<00:01:13.640> for<00:01:14.640> x<00:01:15.000> HD<00:01:15.780> resolution

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
here this is a little prototype we don't

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
here this is a little prototype we don't
have<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> model<00:01:26.310> number<00:01:26.340> yet<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:28.380> fact<00:01:28.680> we

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
have a model number yet and in fact we

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
have a model number yet and in fact we
also<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.549> same<00:01:29.759> chip<00:01:30.060> chip<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.630> little

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
also have the same chip chip in a little

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
also have the same chip chip in a little
hybrid<00:01:31.229> still<00:01:31.590> camera<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.609> can<00:01:32.880> also

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
we're doing is we're demonstrating how

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
we're doing is we're demonstrating how
we<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.070> record<00:01:41.820> shoot<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we can actually record shoot and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.160 
we can actually record shoot and

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
developing I wouldn't say we're there

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.689 
developing I wouldn't say we're there
yet<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:51.639> we're<00:04:51.789> developing<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:53.050> the

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
yet but we're developing for the

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.820 
yet but we're developing for the
production<00:04:54.699> market<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.419> we<00:04:56.289> expect<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.740> be

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
production market and we expect to be

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.340 
production market and we expect to be
able<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.190> do<00:04:57.400> for<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.449> production<00:04:58.810> market

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
able to do for the production market

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.810 
able to do for the production market
what<00:04:59.530> we<00:04:59.680> have<00:04:59.830> done<00:05:00.009> in<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.310> last<00:05:00.340> few<00:05:00.759> years

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
what we have done in the last few years

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.760 
what we have done in the last few years
in<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.210> broadcast<00:05:01.690> market<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.289> that<00:05:02.620> has

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
in the broadcast market and that has

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.219 
in the broadcast market and that has
become<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.099> dominant<00:05:03.639> supplier<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.990> think

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
become a dominant supplier and I think

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.659 
become a dominant supplier and I think
one<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.560> ways<00:05:05.740> we're<00:05:06.009> going<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.220> get<00:05:06.400> there

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
one of the ways we're going to get there

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.659 
one of the ways we're going to get there
is<00:05:06.849> by<00:05:07.210> leveraging<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.349> 4k<00:05:08.770> technology<00:05:09.009> that

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
is by leveraging the 4k technology that

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.029 
is by leveraging the 4k technology that
we've<00:05:09.849> been<00:05:10.030> able<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.300> develop<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.289> we

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
we've been able to develop so that we

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.320 
we've been able to develop so that we
can<00:05:12.190> offer<00:05:12.340> something<00:05:12.699> that's<00:05:13.030> quite<00:05:13.300> unique

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
can offer something that's quite unique

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.999 
can offer something that's quite unique
and<00:05:13.930> quite<00:05:14.080> different<00:05:14.530> from<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.860> other

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
and quite different from the other

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.330 
and quite different from the other
products<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.610> are<00:05:15.729> on<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.910> market<00:05:16.060> today
