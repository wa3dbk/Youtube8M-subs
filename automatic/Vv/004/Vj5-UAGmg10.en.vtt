00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
wild white that I used and then the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
wild white that I used and then the
sinful<00:00:57.629> colors<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> baking<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> con

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
sinful colors with the baking so I con

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.950 
sinful colors with the baking so I con
starch<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.899> used<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.620> obviously<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
starch that I used and obviously the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
starch that I used and obviously the
konad<00:01:04.350> white<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> definitely<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.339> far<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
konad white is definitely by far the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.109 
konad white is definitely by far the
brightest<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:08.150> um<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.140> wet<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.409> wild<00:01:11.119> one

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
brightest but um the wet and wild one

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.920 
brightest but um the wet and wild one
takes<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> close<00:01:12.990> second<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> would

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
takes a close second and then I would

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.859 
takes a close second and then I would
have<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> say<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.950> sinful<00:01:17.820> colors<00:01:18.000> comes<00:01:18.570> last

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
have to say the sinful colors comes last

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
have to say the sinful colors comes last
the<00:01:19.470> wet<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.740> wild<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> sinful<00:01:20.280> color<00:01:20.490> ones

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the wet and wild and sinful color ones

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.810 
the wet and wild and sinful color ones
with<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.119> cornstarch<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.990> quite<00:01:22.860> are

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
with the cornstarch are quite are

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
with the cornstarch are quite are
similar<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.049> while<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> little

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
similar but the one while is a little

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.600 
similar but the one while is a little
bit<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.490> little<00:01:26.580> bit<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.299> bright<00:01:27.600> but

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
bit a little bit more bright but

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
bit a little bit more bright but
considering<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.420> started<00:01:30.960> off

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
considering where this one started off

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.190 
considering where this one started off
at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.710> sinful<00:01:32.070> colors<00:01:32.240> snow<00:01:33.240> white<00:01:33.420> where<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
at the sinful colors snow white where it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
at the sinful colors snow white where it
started<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> cornstarch<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.939> made

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
started off at I the cornstarch it made

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
started off at I the cornstarch it made
a<00:01:36.479> huge<00:01:36.659> difference<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> way<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a huge difference and the way that I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
a huge difference and the way that I
transferred<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.000> before<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> added<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
transferred because before I added it it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
transferred because before I added it it
didn't<00:01:41.070> transfer<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.329> transferred<00:01:42.869> but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
didn't transfer like it transferred but

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
didn't transfer like it transferred but
it<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:43.829> light<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:45.689> mean

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it was really really light and I mean

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
it was really really light and I mean
you<00:01:45.930> could<00:01:46.049> still<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you could still see it but it it is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.929 
you could still see it but it it is
really<00:01:48.000> needed<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> fact<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> went

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
really needed so the fact that it went

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
really needed so the fact that it went
from<00:01:51.180> barely<00:01:51.689> being<00:01:51.990> able<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
from barely being able to see it to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.969 
from barely being able to see it to
actually<00:01:53.009> visible<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.210> actually<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.710> good

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
actually visible is actually really good

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.389 
actually visible is actually really good
and<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.060> might<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.250> compared<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and you know it might not be compared to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880 
and you know it might not be compared to
the<00:01:59.490> conet<00:01:59.820> next<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> each<00:02:00.689> other<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.590> content

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the conet next to each other the content

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
the conet next to each other the content
is<00:02:01.979> obviously<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.520> brighter<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is obviously a lot brighter but if you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
is obviously a lot brighter but if you
were<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.490> Cano<00:02:05.490> if

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you can see that but this I did with all

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.070 
you can see that but this I did with all
of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> sinful<00:02:09.149> colors<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.629> cornstarch

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
of the sinful colors with the cornstarch

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.500 
of the sinful colors with the cornstarch
and<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.280> comes<00:02:11.489> up<00:02:11.610> perfectly<00:02:11.940> fine<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.239> can

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and it comes up perfectly fine you can

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
and it comes up perfectly fine you can
see<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.959> perfectly<00:02:13.349> clear

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
see it's perfectly clear

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.750 
see it's perfectly clear
um<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:15.380> was<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.560> little<00:02:15.770> bit<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.280> didn't

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
um there was a little bit I didn't

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.630 
um there was a little bit I didn't
really<00:02:16.850> clean<00:02:17.150> off<00:02:17.330> my<00:02:17.890> scraper<00:02:18.890> too<00:02:19.220> well<00:02:19.400> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
really clean off my scraper too well and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.190 
really clean off my scraper too well and
i<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:19.850> using<00:02:19.970> black<00:02:20.270> before<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> kind<00:02:21.110> of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
i was using black before so it kind of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
i was using black before so it kind of
got<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:22.610> kind<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.910> got<00:02:23.090> um<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.250> black<00:02:25.490> kind<00:02:25.730> of

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
got it kind of got um the black kind of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.200 
got it kind of got um the black kind of
leaked<00:02:25.970> into<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.330> white<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.830> i<00:02:28.220> mean<00:02:29.030> it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
leaked into the white but i mean it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.750 
leaked into the white but i mean it
shows<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.660> perfectly<00:02:30.080> fine<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.610> that's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
shows up perfectly fine and so that's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.020 
shows up perfectly fine and so that's
definitely<00:02:32.060> an<00:02:32.510> option<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:32.960> me<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.350> use

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.690 

before<00:02:38.030> i<00:02:38.360> decide<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.140> order<00:02:39.170> my<00:02:40.040> next<00:02:40.370> cone<00:02:40.580> at

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you can't go wrong with the code and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500 
you can't go wrong with the code and
polishes<00:02:55.010> they<00:02:55.190> work<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:56.060> guaranteed<00:02:56.480> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
polishes they work it's guaranteed to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.210 
polishes they work it's guaranteed to
work<00:02:56.810> there's<00:02:57.080> no<00:02:57.230> second<00:02:57.590> guessing<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.190> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
work there's no second guessing so I

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
well with the white but it might work

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.040 
well with the white but it might work
better<00:03:18.680> with<00:03:18.890> other<00:03:19.060> other<00:03:20.060> brands<00:03:20.810> other

definitely post comment let me know how

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.960 
definitely post comment let me know how
it<00:03:29.660> works<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.230> doesn't<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:30.680> all<00:03:30.830> i<00:03:31.190> want<00:03:31.910> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
it works if it doesn't at all i want to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.410 
it works if it doesn't at all i want to
know<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.270> too<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:34.040> some<00:03:34.640> as<00:03:34.970> far<00:03:35.270> as<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
know that too but in some as far as it

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.270 
know that too but in some as far as it
goes<00:03:35.660> i<00:03:36.020> think<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.470> was<00:03:36.530> worth<00:03:36.709> doing<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.190> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
goes i think it was worth doing it to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.880 
goes i think it was worth doing it to
this<00:03:37.400> white<00:03:37.840> because<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.290> made<00:03:39.740> it<00:03:39.860> better

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
this white because it made it better

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.890 
this white because it made it better

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
anyway i might try and i might give it a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.270 
anyway i might try and i might give it a
try<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.380> my<00:03:45.470> other<00:03:45.620> nail<00:03:45.830> polishes<00:03:46.250> that

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
try just of my other nail polishes that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.580 
try just of my other nail polishes that
I<00:03:46.400> don't<00:03:46.580> mean<00:03:46.700> use<00:03:46.850> as<00:03:47.000> often<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.290> are<00:03:48.560> a
