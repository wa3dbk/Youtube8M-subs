underneath it so I've got I had to get

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
underneath it so I've got I had to get
some<00:01:36.060> extra<00:01:36.299> space<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> 160<00:01:37.350> gig<00:01:37.500> hard<00:01:37.680> drive

some extra space as a 160 gig hard drive

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
some extra space as a 160 gig hard drive
isn't<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.670> days<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.939> had<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
isn't really much these days I had to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
isn't really much these days I had to
get<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> bit<00:01:39.540> more<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.110> I'll<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.829> underneath<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
get a bit more and I'll go underneath it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
get a bit more and I'll go underneath it
something<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> look<00:01:42.509> flush<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> extra

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
something that look flush with it extra

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.870 
something that look flush with it extra

minimax hard drive from and Brandi's i
omega<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.070> sits<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:54.210> flush

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
