00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
right up and then you're just finding
it's<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> stable<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> air<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it's so stable up in the air it's like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
it's so stable up in the air it's like
amazing<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.989> looks<00:00:52.370> I've<00:00:53.370> always<00:00:53.640> thought<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
amazing it looks I've always thought it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
amazing it looks I've always thought it
looks<00:00:54.120> pretty<00:00:54.239> easy<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.649> easier

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
looks pretty easy but it is much easier

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.830 
looks pretty easy but it is much easier
than<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.399> looks<00:00:56.430> once<00:00:57.300> you're<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.719> air

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
than it looks once you're up in the air

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
than it looks once you're up in the air
it<00:00:58.140> stabilizes<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.820> simple<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> learn

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it stabilizes a lot it's simple to learn

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
it stabilizes a lot it's simple to learn
but<00:01:01.050> very<00:01:01.260> hard<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.680> master<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.789> doesn't<00:01:03.149> get

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but very hard to master it doesn't get

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.189 
but very hard to master it doesn't get
old<00:01:03.300> there's<00:01:03.690> always<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> new<00:01:04.170> challenge

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
old there's always a new challenge

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.800 
old there's always a new challenge
there's<00:01:04.799> always<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> new<00:01:05.309> wing<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> try<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
there's always a new wing to try the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
there's always a new wing to try the
technology<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.740> keeps<00:01:07.950> improving<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:09.119> call

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
technology just keeps improving we call

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
technology just keeps improving we call
it<00:01:09.330> coloring<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> sky<00:01:10.549> because<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.790> leave

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it coloring in the sky because you leave

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.469 
it coloring in the sky because you leave
your<00:01:12.750> contrail<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.799> where<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:15.030> it's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
your contrail of where you're going it's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.830 
your contrail of where you're going it's
creative<00:01:16.229> its<00:01:16.920> imaginative<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
creative its imaginative you have to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
creative its imaginative you have to
you're<00:01:19.439> dealing<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.240> fourth<00:01:21.240> dimension

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you're dealing with the fourth dimension

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.160 
you're dealing with the fourth dimension
and<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.670> challenging<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.900> when

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and so it's very challenging but when

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
and so it's very challenging but when
done<00:01:25.439> correctly<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.570> incredibly<00:01:27.570> rewarding

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
done correctly it's incredibly rewarding

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.270 
done correctly it's incredibly rewarding
I<00:01:28.380> try<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> emphasize<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> beauty<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
I try to emphasize the beauty of the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
I try to emphasize the beauty of the
mountain<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.240> than<00:01:33.360> anything<00:01:33.450> but

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
mountain really more than anything but

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
mountain really more than anything but
you<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.680> treadle<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.610> try<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> teach

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you do treadle I also try to teach

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
you do treadle I also try to teach
everyone<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> glider

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
everyone a little bit about the glider

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
everyone a little bit about the glider
you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> fly<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.110> they

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you know a little bit how to fly so they

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
you know a little bit how to fly so they
can<00:01:40.409> go<00:01:40.770> away<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.759> feel<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.630> they've

has<00:01:54.149> nothing<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.079> para<00:01:55.770> biting<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
has nothing to do with para biting and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
has nothing to do with para biting and
they<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:56.850> regulate<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.200> real

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
they don't regulate it and so it's real

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.289 
they don't regulate it and so it's real
free<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.189> cannot<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.180> just

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
free to and you cannot but it's just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.200 
free to and you cannot but it's just
flying<00:02:00.570> which<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.439> cool<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.219> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
flying which is really cool it's a it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.840 
flying which is really cool it's a it's
a<00:02:03.360> simplest<00:02:03.719> way<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> fly<00:02:04.079> fpv<00:02:04.250> it's<00:02:05.250> funny<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
a simplest way to fly fpv it's funny the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.330 
a simplest way to fly fpv it's funny the
passengers<00:02:06.390> who<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.630> most<00:02:06.990> bold<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
passengers who are most bold who want a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
passengers who are most bold who want a
big<00:02:08.610> fly<00:02:08.940> too<00:02:09.000> high<00:02:09.179> flight<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.259> want

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
big fly too high flight or really want

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
big fly too high flight or really want
to<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> aerobatic<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.790> they're<00:02:12.090> bold<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
to do the aerobatic if they're bold on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.590 
to do the aerobatic if they're bold on
the<00:02:12.900> ground

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the ground

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.870 
the ground
they're<00:02:13.750> usually<00:02:13.990> wimpy<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> air<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.430> if

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
they're usually wimpy in the air and if

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.730 
they're usually wimpy in the air and if
they're<00:02:16.090> kind<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.420> reserved<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.200> quiet<00:02:17.320> on

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
they're kind of reserved and quiet on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.620 
they're kind of reserved and quiet on
the<00:02:18.070> ground<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.640> think<00:02:19.000> that's<00:02:19.150> common<00:02:19.600> sense

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the ground I think that's common sense

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720 
the ground I think that's common sense
and<00:02:20.110> those<00:02:20.410> people<00:02:20.710> tend<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.160> loosen<00:02:21.490> up<00:02:21.610> in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
and those people tend to loosen up in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.180 
and those people tend to loosen up in
the<00:02:21.790> air<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.300> at<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.050> very<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the air and one at all so it's very the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.700 
the air and one at all so it's very the
psychology<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.880> flying<00:02:25.240> with<00:02:25.810> pilot<00:02:26.530> with

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
psychology of flying with pilot with

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.430 
psychology of flying with pilot with
passengers<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.340> very<00:02:27.640> interesting<00:02:28.440> it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
passengers is very interesting it's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.810 
passengers is very interesting it's
always<00:02:29.770> different<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.430> always<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> challenge

always different it's always a challenge

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.610
