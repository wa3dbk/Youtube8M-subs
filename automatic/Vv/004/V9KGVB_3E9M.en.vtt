00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.160

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 m6 that you know well 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.580
 hi girls so we have plenty of 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.439
 possible strengths issues for example 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.660
 would have said what is it like to be 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.380
 the best pastry chef 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.090
 frankly I still can not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 realize it's a bit ch a little bit 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 in the clouds in the world 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 wonderful of the best etc 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 I did not go down again and I ask 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 the atmosphere between the candidates 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910
 start that's going on it was a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 little summer camp 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 already you put in a room that is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 pastry chef he only talks about cakes 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.449
 all day and we all know very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 well heard 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.350
 it was really a great atmosphere and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.850
 I would not have believed it but arriving 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.930
 precisely I participate in the costs then 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.160
 what are we doing pastries 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 at the end of broadcasts I speak the whole 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.739
 world is asking the question 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.290
 do not panic there is not one left 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 crumbs cake at the end of the end 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.890
 of filming since there is a team of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 filming all around us happening 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 his day filming the cakes and to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.799
 salivating so we put an end to their ordeal 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.350
 after tasting they have the right to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.080
 cut the internet cable this series 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.509
 neymar does they are in syria is not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 really are really very nice cyril 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.920
 it's like you envisioned letter like 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 you see the TV what he is greedy and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.560
 this with the accent and all and copy 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.299
 stick and mercotte frankly I find 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 it's more fun than the image that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.829
 she sometimes when she sees her on the screen 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 a little strict and or so in fact she 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.060
 is really very funny and very simple 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.510
 best pastry chefs together how 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.130
 did it was not a little said 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.900
 it was a little tiring yes because 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.360
 well it was hot these long 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.310
 days when we are standing but good 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.660
 I was very pampered by the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 production and by other candidates 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.710
 who were really too nice to me 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.390
 and faustine bollaert who what can 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.950
 well mandant does not upset women 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 together 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.640
 so here I was it was a super 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 experience 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.740
 whatever happens and it does not have me 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.340
 favor me disabled by the fact that she 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.420
 have evidence that has struck you the most 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 so a test that I really 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.310
 loved it was the biscuit monument at 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.020
 start I thought monument cookies 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.459
 or that's not going at all with my stuff and 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.560
 and finally I'm really amused at 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 do my big pedantic gingerbread and 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.209
 yeah that's it, we really have a test 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.380
 that I'm good you also won the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.090
 right to edit his cookbook 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.570
 would like to know a little bit about 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.720
 is new and before premiere so here it is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.180
 the book so I basically in the book 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.610
 we will not find some key recipes 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.920
 from the show like the big band my 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 cake with the word cake to dress 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.180
 with the pink icing that is there the pie 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.540
 of strawberries 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.930
 Here these cakes that have some marked 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.660
 my course and I also have plenty of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.530
 unpublished recipes that are quite 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.769
 the image of my universe I confess a little 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 feminine a little example 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.220
 so I made perfect cupcakes 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.470
 vanilla a sky cake in gradients of 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 pink 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.420
 I have a very very beautiful chocolate cake 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.840
 cocoon full of ideas to make at home 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.190
 to please everyone how many 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.620
 time you have set to achieve its 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.150
 books I pass you noted that I 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980
 was no longer pregnant so in fact the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.739
 filming is not live 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 ea ended in July so we 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.360
 had two months this summer to finish the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.820
 book and do them 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.470
 what are your projects what I have 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.450
 really loved during the show this is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.040
 to invent recipes is managed blog of 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.170
 kitchen called fashion cooking 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.579
 that I animate for six years he thinks 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.260
 that it's really what I want to 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.480
 to do now is to pass 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920
 maybe a professional stage for 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.519
 everything that is content creation 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.290
 culinary 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.680
 so if I can write other books 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.230
 do a TV show around 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.840
 recipes or maybe make recipes 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.380
 video about our family your cake 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.299
 prefer 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.769
 no it's they higher income 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.470
 on the matter worse the day so much 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.669
 hungry impossible to choose but I have a 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.280
 little preference for all cakes 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.620
 a little bit more fruit than 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.700
 chocolate then we also have them 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.100
 Internet users who asked us 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.190
 questions on facebook there are to pick up at 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.690
 what will the Christmas log look like 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.940
 so for must be thrown a little 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.500
 traumatized by the final event so 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.070
 I will not be a rectangular log 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.330
 would put a visible rod log with I 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.439
 believe she puts a little 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.610
 I have not thought about it yet but I 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.560
 think she will be with small 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.470
 shells of euro macaroons on top 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.470
 and raspberry passion flavors that's it 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.310
 another question when does that 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.979
 it's asked for marriage 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.919
 oh no but wait there there were my 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.680
 queries on the course of writing with siri 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.819
 so I do not want to impose myself 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:17.400
 thank you the canvas sophie for being with 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:25.460

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:28.460
 no no but in fact the diff austin r the 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.460
 road 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:35.520

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.949

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:47.819

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:49.770
 ambient we go there we end of no 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:06:05.930
 let's talk a little bit about 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:06:05.930
 pastries and 10 months of January 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.530

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.270
 is not good at all it's safe and 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.270

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.300
 go go you will take mine back
