00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:10.410
 even though in africa i know little 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.100
 it's summer but it's a tournament where 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.960
 will play a lot of parties and 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.870
 and it's a big tournament 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 special international because it's 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.870
 true that African players evolving 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.820
 in different championships it's 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.670
 often good players so between 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.700
 others facing da good players 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.070
 so here it is a very beautiful 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.210
 competition to play 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 I personally thought that the stadiums 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.820
 would have been pre-filled that and all that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.559
 but it's still a very nice competition 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.559
 to do and we are very happy in state 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 the course of the national team in 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 2010 we did not expect their course 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.780
 may be the reason is surprised by 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.239
 report to the governed by that I kept 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
 a good memory of the match against caen 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 Ivory atmosphere in the stadiums 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.830
 I think it's an atmosphere 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.920
 different europe where it looks a little 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.500
 more atmosphere more music more than 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 field more cheerfulness in the stands 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 and that I think it's a strong sign 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 from the African continent is me 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 remember the one to which 96 here I 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 followed Algeria so here it was 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 advertising the pros but for how 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 say the first the first few 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.550
 that I am no it is a preparation 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.740
 different from a sense where when we know 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.960
 we will participate in the united tan think 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.580
 almost every day 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.710
 the first match for me it'll be 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.220
 the atmosphere with the team with 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.260
 teammates 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 after that it's true that the preparation is 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.830
 seen differently no I think it's 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.510
 based on the physical simply 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.220
 after fo after the fake 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.280
 world no it's not a preparation 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.690
 different it's just based on the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.260
 physical has too much the day of the match on 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.610
 commits socially we got the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.190
 pretty tough preparation with the coach 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.450
 and the whole group 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.240
 we have a lot of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.760
 worked we forget also we have in summer 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.940
 and it was so difficult for us 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 but here you are, everything is going well 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 here 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.120
 we'll say it's the special one two 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.440
 three viva algeria there has always been 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.500
 favorites but I think since 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 a few years the African continent 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.410
 who has more big nations as per 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 example in 2010 everyone 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.640
 expected the Ivory Coast 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 daniel button announced the zambia that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.580
 win so now there is more than 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 small nations 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.300
 it's more favored the Ivory Coast 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.480
 because hiding everyone is at 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.340
 current and also the ghana that is when 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.370
 even a big team hours on the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.420
 African continent 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.110
 maybe Zambia too which is it 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.209
 is title holder 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.300
 in clear the 3 4 teams coming out of the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.300
 lot 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 we mean as much as I think 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.590
 that it's a big tournament with 16 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.490
 teams 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.690
 It is difficult to 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.360
 to find a real favorite apart from 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.290
 will say the Ivory Coast which is one of 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.480
 better if not the best 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.010
 Africa team but we know very well 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 that in a competition where a lot of 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.780
 thing can happen and especially 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.400
 today like yacine he has no 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.250
 small nations so 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.530
 and it's more cvc if we compare the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.550
 african cup of recent years 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 with the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.360
 the others he is ten years fifteen years 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.630
 before you can really start 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.690
 start find the square the final square 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.850
 while today as the year 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.980
 last we did not imagine that the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.380
 Zambia could win especially in the final 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.810
 against the Ivory Coast so no here 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.980
 it's hard to find who will win 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.570
 before the competition 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.240
 really I was the whole team on 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.400
 learned that we see that the middle zone and 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.680
 we have seen that they do not deserve it 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.630
 he told me hopefully that wants 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.640
 really say that there are more small 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.940
 small teams in africa all 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.940
 simply 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.139
 I think motivation plus I think 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.610
 that every year is really a 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.139
 event a different event 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.990
 last year we could not participate 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.860
 this year we are here and we hope we 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.169
 will make a good journey 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.910
 yes because it's because 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.300
 Algeria it was a football people 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.560
 people live through football so 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.150
 to be qualified for this can it is already 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.100
 very important to be there too so 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.230
 so actually for the people 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.550
 Algerian it's for us it's 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.730
 important thing to participate in this 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.730
 range 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.020
 I think personal goals 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.350
 here is that even if it's a sport 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.389
 of equipped here everyone hopes to play the most 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.250
 possible and after good level at the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.949
 collective I think we are all 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.199
 aware that we have a good team 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.660
 and the main goal is two of 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.470
 get out of the group and then I hope to go 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.470
 as far as possible behind
