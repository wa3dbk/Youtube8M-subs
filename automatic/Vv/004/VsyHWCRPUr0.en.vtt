00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and he just has to start thinking about

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.819

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
what he's doing and where the poles are

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
what he's doing and where the poles are
and<00:01:01.829> again<00:01:02.160> after<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.880> pole<00:01:03.120> he<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.690> landed
