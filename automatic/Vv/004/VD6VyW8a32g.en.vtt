00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
really important sounds simple but

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.479 
really important sounds simple but
there's<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.620> lot<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.920> things<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.280> can<00:00:37.460> go

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
there's a lot of things that can go

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.960 
there's a lot of things that can go
funny

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
funny

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.860 
funny
so<00:00:38.960> what's<00:00:39.830> not<00:00:39.949> I'd<00:00:40.129> be<00:00:40.160> everything<00:00:40.519> to<00:00:40.550> say

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
so what's not I'd be everything to say

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.330 
so what's not I'd be everything to say
let<00:00:41.870> three

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.729 

all<00:00:48.340> right<00:00:48.520> so<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.809> got<00:00:49.930> two<00:00:50.110> different<00:00:50.260> kinds

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
all right so we got two different kinds

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.650 
all right so we got two different kinds
of<00:00:50.829> nets<00:00:50.980> here<00:00:51.190> they're<00:00:52.120> kind<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.600> same

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
of nets here they're kind of the same

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.740 
of nets here they're kind of the same
exact<00:00:53.140> shape<00:00:53.350> same<00:00:53.680> exact<00:00:53.950> design<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.750> that's

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
exact shape same exact design and that's

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.090 
exact shape same exact design and that's
that's<00:00:56.020> really<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.470> know<00:00:56.559> what<00:00:56.770> makes<00:00:56.980> the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
that's really you know what makes the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.979 
that's really you know what makes the
point<00:00:57.370> an<00:00:57.489> acquaintance<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.660> there<00:00:58.900> are<00:00:58.960> a

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
point an acquaintance but there are a

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.390 
point an acquaintance but there are a
couple<00:00:59.110> different<00:00:59.470> heights<00:00:59.680> this<00:00:59.980> one's<00:01:00.220> made

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
couple different heights this one's made

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.580 
couple different heights this one's made
out<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:01.180> aluminum<00:01:01.629> this<00:01:01.930> one's<00:01:02.199> made<00:01:02.379> out<00:01:02.410> of

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
out of aluminum this one's made out of

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.060 
out of aluminum this one's made out of
wood<00:01:02.770> Japanese<00:01:03.730> English<00:01:04.210> style<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.890> both

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
wood Japanese English style they both

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.550 
wood Japanese English style they both
float<00:01:06.400> which<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.820> really<00:01:07.090> important<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.440> they

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
float which is really important and they

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.109 
float which is really important and they
glide<00:01:08.830> through<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.130> water<00:01:09.220> really<00:01:09.880> nicely

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
glide through the water really nicely

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.320 
glide through the water really nicely
that's<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.900> really<00:01:11.410> really<00:01:11.680> key<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.820> happening

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
that's a really really key to happening

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
that's a really really key to happening
good<00:01:13.479> meal<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:13.960> notice<00:01:14.770> here<00:01:14.920> they<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.220> this

was telling me you know if you have
really<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.050> big<00:01:41.259> coin<00:01:41.530> you're<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.220> little

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
really really big coin you're a little

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.790 
really really big coin you're a little
bit<00:01:42.880> deeper<00:01:43.210> as<00:01:43.840> opposed<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.440> little<00:01:44.679> more

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
bit deeper as opposed to a little more

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.710 
bit deeper as opposed to a little more
shallow<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.399> as<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.060> tell<00:01:46.119> this<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.630> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
shallow and as you can tell this is a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.200 
shallow and as you can tell this is a
shorter<00:01:47.020> net<00:01:47.170> design<00:01:47.470> for<00:01:47.649> smaller<00:01:47.920> fish

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
shorter net design for smaller fish

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.690 
shorter net design for smaller fish
design<00:01:49.210> for<00:01:49.450> about<00:01:49.600> bigger<00:01:49.840> fish<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:51.640> you

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
design for about bigger fish say you

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.699 
design for about bigger fish say you
have<00:01:51.910> an<00:01:52.000> 18<00:01:52.240> inch<00:01:52.390> fish<00:01:52.630> probably<00:01:53.470> won't<00:01:53.619> like

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
have an 18 inch fish probably won't like

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.370 
have an 18 inch fish probably won't like
a<00:01:53.740> 20<00:01:54.160> inch<00:01:54.369> round<00:01:54.910> net<00:01:55.209> so<00:01:55.810> think<00:01:56.020> about<00:01:56.110> the

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
a 20 inch round net so think about the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.350 
a 20 inch round net so think about the
size<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.770> your<00:01:56.830> fish<00:01:57.069> in<00:01:57.220> your<00:01:57.250> pond<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.910> how

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
size of your fish in your pond and how

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.210 
size of your fish in your pond and how
big<00:01:58.709> potentially<00:01:59.709> they're<00:01:59.860> going<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.039> beat

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
big potentially they're going to beat

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.499 
big potentially they're going to beat
when<00:02:00.369> you're<00:02:00.520> picking<00:02:00.670> up<00:02:00.880> an<00:02:01.060> extra<00:02:01.360> you're

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
when you're picking up an extra you're

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.369 
when you're picking up an extra you're
going

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.070 

all<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.670> our<00:02:11.760> Masato<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.629> top<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.019> my

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
all right so so our Masato on top of my

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.290 
all right so so our Masato on top of my
pond<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.580> figured<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.000> would

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
pond here because I figured that would

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.600 
pond here because I figured that would
that's<00:02:15.810> mimic<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.459> an

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that's mimic like you have going on an

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.750 
that's mimic like you have going on an
airplane<00:02:17.760> pond<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.300> your<00:02:18.330> house<00:02:19.519> these<00:02:20.519> these

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
airplane pond in your house these these

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.280 
airplane pond in your house these these
ponds<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.209> raised<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.870> really<00:02:22.050> really

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
ponds are raised so it's really really

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.009 
ponds are raised so it's really really
easy<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.680> catch<00:02:22.920> fish<00:02:23.629> coming<00:02:24.629> from<00:02:24.750> top<00:02:24.989> a

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
easy to catch fish coming from top a

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.720 
easy to catch fish coming from top a
little<00:02:25.260> different<00:02:25.650> angles<00:02:26.040> more<00:02:26.250> tricky

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
little different angles more tricky

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.949 
little different angles more tricky
so<00:02:27.299> that's<00:02:27.870> Posadas<00:02:28.410> doing<00:02:28.709> up<00:02:28.830> top<00:02:29.959> first

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
so that's Posadas doing up top first

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.839 
so that's Posadas doing up top first
first<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.590> we're<00:02:31.709> going<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.340> take

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
first thing we're going to do is take

first thing we're going to do is take
this<00:02:32.940> bowl<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.480> fill<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.019> up<00:02:34.110> about<00:02:34.319> halfway

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
this bowl and fill it up about halfway

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.370 
this bowl and fill it up about halfway
full<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.310> water<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:39.200> we'll<00:02:40.200> stop

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
full of water like so and we'll stop

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.080 
full of water like so and we'll stop
them<00:02:40.560> pets<00:02:40.799> gonna<00:02:41.130> catch<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.370> ghosty<00:02:41.910> we're

them pets gonna catch that ghosty we're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.809 
them pets gonna catch that ghosty we're
talking<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.510> earlier<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.549> I'll<00:02:44.549> narrate

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
talking about earlier and I'll narrate

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.420 
talking about earlier and I'll narrate
what's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> my<00:02:46.829> sauce<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
what's going on so my sauce is going to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
what's going on so my sauce is going to
move<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> net<00:02:47.819> really<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.540> slowly<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.079> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
move the net really really slowly in the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.380 
move the net really really slowly in the
water<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:50.069> start<00:02:50.130> jerking<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.849> around<00:02:51.120> it's

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
water you start jerking it around it's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.150 
water you start jerking it around it's
going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.630> freak<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.019> fish<00:02:52.230> out<00:02:52.410> they're

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
going to freak the fish out they're

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.449 
going to freak the fish out they're
going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.810> jump<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.079> scroll<00:02:55.890> around<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.370> you

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
going to jump and scroll around so you

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.130 
going to jump and scroll around so you
can<00:02:56.610> see<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:56.790> very<00:02:57.209> slow<00:02:57.780> soft<00:02:58.260> movements

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
can see very very slow soft movements

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.839 
can see very very slow soft movements
next<00:03:01.140> thing<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:02.099> going<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.430> take<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
next thing is going to just take the

ball and you notice the bowl is on the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.309 
ball and you notice the bowl is on the
outside<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> net<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.299> simply<00:03:06.569> turns

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
outside of the net and you simply turns

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.789 
outside of the net and you simply turns
it<00:03:07.440> over<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.680> rolls<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.129> fish<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.430> there<00:03:08.610> and

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
it over a rolls of fish in there and

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.050 
it over a rolls of fish in there and
pull<00:03:10.799> some<00:03:10.980> water<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.549> again<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.000> have

pull some water up so again so you have

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.780 
pull some water up so again so you have
just<00:03:12.329> about<00:03:12.480> halfway<00:03:12.780> through<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.410> water<00:03:13.790> 3/4

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
just about halfway through the water 3/4

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.160 
just about halfway through the water 3/4
full<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.060> water<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.510> too<00:03:15.780> much<00:03:15.930> water

full of water if you have too much water

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.280 
full of water if you have too much water
in<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.530> bowl

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.920 

too<00:03:19.890> much<00:03:20.040> water<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.599> easily

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
too much water like that just can easily

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.899 
too much water like that just can easily
jump<00:03:22.260> out<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.769> actually<00:03:23.430> maybe<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.730> bowl

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
jump out and actually maybe the bowl

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.360 
jump out and actually maybe the bowl
will<00:03:24.060> sink<00:03:24.299> that's<00:03:24.870> no<00:03:25.140> good<00:03:25.349> so<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:25.980> like

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
will sink that's no good so we like like

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.590 
will sink that's no good so we like like
to<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.870> book<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:28.079> half

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
to have this book about half

spins<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:00.940> sits<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.240> water<00:05:01.450> graceful<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.560> got

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
spins and sits the water graceful I got

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.920 
spins and sits the water graceful I got
like<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:02.920> divers<00:05:03.460> with<00:05:03.720> another<00:05:04.720> real

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
important thing is we're not really

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.030 
important thing is we're not really
squeezing<00:05:07.660> anything<00:05:07.900> we're<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.860> holding

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
squeezing anything we're just holding

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.160 
squeezing anything we're just holding
its<00:05:09.340> head<00:05:09.520> like<00:05:09.730> so<00:05:09.940> holding<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.750> back<00:05:10.930> there

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
its head like so holding it back there

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.230 
its head like so holding it back there
you<00:05:11.590> start<00:05:11.830> squeezing<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.580> gills<00:05:12.850> it'll

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
you start squeezing on the gills it'll

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.690 
you start squeezing on the gills it'll
cause<00:05:13.420> no<00:05:13.810> bleeding<00:05:14.080> from<00:05:14.380> stress<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.160> that's
