 just to illustrate 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.480
 Another cool thing about this control is that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 it is also compatible with pc just the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.230
 your pc have an adapter or something like

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.840
 bluetooth so if his box is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.609
 I found it very beautiful here, it has some logos 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 android case 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.950

 there is nothing and back here in some 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.500

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.409
 So come on, let's get it started. 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.960
 the box to show you 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.590
 So I opened the box and it's a little bit 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.990
 complicated the box is a little difficult to 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 work here for you to open nothing 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.540
 it is then impossible is here 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 cool it has a good texture is zinha 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.939
 soft found very interesting that it 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.340
 passes the feeling that is rubbery 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.600
 so here you can pull the put 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.899

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 to decrease the volume increase I believe 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.180

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.060
 ab ways 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.030
 speaking control is very beautiful here 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.860
 You have to reset to become control 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.410

 and here have 125 of the en2 buttons two leds 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.709
 which show things such as that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.720
 shows that you are charging the battery and 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.450
 here he shows that he is looking for 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.400
 some bluetooth device and why 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.090
 I saw it's very easy to set you up. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.040
 active that is the control and rain the port 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.019
 on your smartphone or tablet, and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.820
 automatically the phantom debate 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.220
 which recognizes its control 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.410
 There you plug and play many games. 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.390
 many games even especially 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.459

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.640
 control or with any control made 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.109
 for android and if you have a western 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.389
 remembering that it works with west too 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.370
 With that happening I told you in 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:55.780
 much of the control is not the control 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:58.480
