00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.560
 hello everyone good as well we go 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.710
 to go today with the final part of list of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 djs the rest of in let's go explaining 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.619
 I step by step, we go there 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.750
 for this sign 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.309
 training 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.440
 Now, ristov is asking us for the weapon of 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.839
 the zombies then what are we going to do 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.399
 is to assemble the parts of the catapult and 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.230
 now each with its respective 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.530
 catapult 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.780
 now three players are going to go to the other 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.970
 side where the dragon is and they will go 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.010
 each one to its respective site where 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.199
 are the signs of the zombies in the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.000
 soil that I will now teach and the other 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.370
 player is the one who is going to leave here the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
 catapult is for them to pass to 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.550
 another side will pick it up and it will 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.879
 put up on your site but I will 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.879
 tell 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's worth it now we put the catapult right 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.120
 on top of the zombie brand and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.120
 we listen to what christopher tells us 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.000
 perfect then samuel or the only one 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.870
 he will listen but he will see that all 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.760
 we are doing it correctly 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.460
 then the one that is up here just 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.800
 on the sofa this is always going to have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.690
 closed so that to have more 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.100
 comfort with those with visuals and nothing 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.970
 more that will be pending from here to the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.970
 side of the left 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 another player will be placed in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.799
 this site will then put the catapult 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.130
 perfectly placed on top of the drawing 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.380
 of the zombie and looking towards the tower for 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 to be able to throw them well is worth here it will be 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.670
 the third partner and then he will place 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.070
 the catapult on the site this also the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 zombie just facing the tower 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.350
 then so all the zombies when 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.300
 go to 100 will be launched by the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.130
 catapult towards the tower 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.600
 here would be placed the fourth companion 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.460
 then the only thing that would have to be 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.610
 wait is the zombies came 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.560
 and attract them all to throw it towards 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.180
 the tower and that's all that would be 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 defend ourselves among ourselves so that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.370
 they kill us and defend the catapults like 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.980
 be so that they do not break and you have to go 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.870
 for new catapults then now 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.430
 let's see a little how would be the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.950
 recreation of zombies view 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.010
 throwing himself towards the tower well then 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 once you do this correctly 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.420
 this will take as much as two 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.520
 rounds three as much in turning on 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.340
 tower but the tower will light up 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.170
 half of the blue lights is worth 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.480
 half then once you have 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 turned on halfway now it will have to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.189
 do the next step 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.290
 then once the tower is filled 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.060
 of the souls is going to turn blue 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.489
 and front gig is going to say it's all 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.379
 perfect but what is left to do with the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.879
 fists galvanized then how are we going 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.030
 to do so there is a little note and in the 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.239
 corner that would be north of the tower and 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.280
 making a numbering together with the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.579
 Poles of the North Tower South East and West 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.220
 we would do so with the galvanized with the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.980
 fists we would give 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.760
 and we would have the gentlemen look at what 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.470
 achievement achieved mode ristov in the unique 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
 What remains for me to say is that in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.430
 next video I'll explain step by step 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.290
 how do you do well with the letters of the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.160
 mayon so you do not have any 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.170
 difficulty but what is clear is 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.470
 that people first was the interest of 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 trans and after rice christopher and 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.710
 now we are going to train until the next 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.710
 video
