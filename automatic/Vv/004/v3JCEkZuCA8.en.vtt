once you've got what you want you click
the<00:03:24.669> down<00:03:24.849> arrow<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.269> then<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.569> save<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.199> the

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
the down arrow and then you save to the

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.939 
the down arrow and then you save to the
world<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.280> want<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.549> save<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.680> then

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
world you want to save it to and then

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.759 
world you want to save it to and then
you<00:03:30.639> can<00:03:31.060> wise<00:03:31.479> that<00:03:31.720> go<00:03:32.019> into<00:03:32.139> single-player

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
you can wise that go into single-player

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.720 
you can wise that go into single-player
this<00:03:33.699> is<00:03:33.879> proof<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.479> it<00:03:34.629> works

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.570 

so<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:39.970> as<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:41.530> see<00:03:41.590> at<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> bottom<00:03:42.160> it

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
so now as you can see at the bottom it

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.610 
so now as you can see at the bottom it
says<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:43.210> I<00:03:43.240> have<00:03:44.460> it<00:03:45.460> shows<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.940> have<00:03:45.970> one

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
says that I have it shows I have one

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.410 
says that I have it shows I have one
diamond<00:03:47.620> pickaxe<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.120> wrong

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
diamond pickaxe but that is wrong

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.110 
diamond pickaxe but that is wrong
because<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:53.110> only<00:03:53.890> shows<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.610> number<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:54.970> to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
because it only shows the number up to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.940 
because it only shows the number up to
64<00:03:56.640> but<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.700> actually<00:03:58.570> does<00:03:58.840> have<00:04:00.660> 255

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
64 but this actually does have 255

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.540 
64 but this actually does have 255
because<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.340> will<00:04:03.520> last<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.940> forever<00:04:05.550> but

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
because this will last you forever but

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.120 
because this will last you forever but
even<00:04:06.970> then<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.390> still<00:04:07.600> shows<00:04:08.080> it's<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
even then it still shows it's just the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.860 
even then it still shows it's just the
number<00:04:09.310> they<00:04:10.000> don't<00:04:10.210> put<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.510> number<00:04:10.780> in

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
number they don't put the number in

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.560 
number they don't put the number in
there<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.230> don't<00:04:11.860> know<00:04:11.920> why<00:04:12.130> but<00:04:13.030> once<00:04:13.420> you've

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
there I don't know why but once you've

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.540 
there I don't know why but once you've
got<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:14.050> can<00:04:14.530> go<00:04:14.800> on<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.220> do<00:04:15.370> whatever
