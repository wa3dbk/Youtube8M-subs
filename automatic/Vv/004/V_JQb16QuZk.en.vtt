00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 eat often then today we 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 let's go make a little Christmas tree all 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.550
 just for the little ones 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.010
 still a few small ones can do it 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 so for that it takes a come when 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 are either already towards or you are doing 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.490
 coloring we go by the little cotton or 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 scissors tic small radius 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 glitter if you have small 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.019
 bowls 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.330
 everything we can stick on it for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.090
 discover him especially in maths 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.750
 he folded in half had more or less 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 great 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.890
 depending on the size of the small tree is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.559
 wanted to do next 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.540
 so we drew a triangle on it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.149
 so I'm going to make a small cut 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:56.100
 feeling of having everything going like this and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:01:00.800
 and then I go frankly the middle of doing a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 small corresponding to the middle in water 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:16.140
 these are pay slips in triangle 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 to make the little tree all that again 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.880
 now I repeat it's really 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.369
 something of all that then we 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.310
 discover so we support him for 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.310
 able to do ego triangle actually 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.250
 his camp after we have our two 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:02:01.829
 equal triangles so what can we do 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:01.829
 so it's getting better so the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.540
 high school with scissors until the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.840
 half of the windows 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.000
 this is here we start from the voice and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:31.019
 bet the couple until the death that goes 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.019
 allow us to invent them another 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.100
 and can do all the wall small fir 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.859
 alone 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.660
 here and then obviously he goes 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.540
 to be able to discover it the scenery it leaves 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.139
 so already are in France and small 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.019
 flakes 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:03:00.519
 here is to make small points body of 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:03.000
 Christmas balls everywhere 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.000
 simply 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:21.270
 so to do on all sides 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:23.280
 obviously i'm going to show you that on 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.700
 Phase 1 tonight over 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:32.880
 respite then I have paint 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.480
 metallic to make them brown us 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.480
 it's like a little point a little 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.480
 all over 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:50.490
 again on all the purposes so 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.620
 that's true it's very simple to 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.050
 do it at times with the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.800
 toddlers and then after to make a 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.250
 little more 3d so glued small 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.250
 red balls 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.820
 obviously a lot of anger it takes 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:47.930
 up and then the little white for 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:51.200
 to do a little bit of snow have stopped 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.850
 content you have to use 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 stickers too if you do not want to 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:09.440
 divide pin code on that it's really 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:13.990
 suitable for the little ones spying on the little 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.990
 bioland one in six young 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:26.779
 and here is a little tree we can do 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:29.379
 to do to the little ones that's what Christmas 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.379
 the death
