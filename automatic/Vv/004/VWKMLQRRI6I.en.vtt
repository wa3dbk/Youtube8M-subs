00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.920
 druste i wanted to share my video 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.490
 as we welded the snow dump on a quad bike 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.490
 this model quadro stealth 700 dinli 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 I'll start thinking about it for a long time 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:35.360
 buy a new one or do it yourself 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:39.910
 watched other people's videos after all 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.680
 worth 12 16 thousand 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:53.970
 no bargaining this one thought that and that thought 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:01:01.530
 I bet you went to cook from the frame 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:07.119
 the snow dump itself but from this frame 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.910
 that's little boiled this frame about 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:16.149
 metal bought metal 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:19.420
 everything came out 800 rubles but not all given 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.350
 I had this sheet 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.539
 that is, I bought these 20 to 20 pipes 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.190
 These arcs I bought are ready for metal 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:39.220
 base this one beam bought 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:45.069
 also the beam 100 to 50 came not only 700 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.860
 rubles still tell the thickness of the sheet like 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:51.399
 I would measure two millimeters 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:58.400
 it is clear that it was but we foot in 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:03.940
 bent welded here to the frame 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.910
 Well, in short, we made a frame welded 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.590
 iron sheet made sure 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:19.900
 raskosiny from all sides below the top of them 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:23.410
 bolt middle on bolts secured further 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.669
 I'll tell you now to the diary 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.669
 [music] 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.280
 that's the height of the bucket as far as he 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.890
 raises think high enough for 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.060
 about 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.910
 I wanted to put here or plates 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.830
 8mm dashing 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.990
 still thought put found 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:58.640
 shipping tape set thing 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:01.440
 awesomely tried to clean everything is cool not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:08.960
 jumps over bucket mass to stroke 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.960
 it all rows fine further 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.050
 what we did next cooked means 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.000
 frame further we thought long and hard 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.480
 how do you do 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 mount on the bottom of the quad in the end 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.610
 made 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:38.740
 plate secured to the bottom of the yoke you 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:43.150
 there a couple of clamps and bolts and made 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:48.870
 corners beer see on the beam that is not 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:52.570
 on the beam welded to this sheet corners 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:57.640
 secured the beam with corners so thick 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:01.150
 bolt that was reliable because 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.270
 watched the video still people become on 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.430
 small bolt 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:13.780
 unreliable bolt somewhere around 24 inches it's on 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:20.530
 26 did not know who gave me here we are 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.870
 secured the corner set the beam further 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.210
 we began to strengthen blood 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.330
 [music] 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:33.790
 our easy corner from the channel was 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.500
 that is, we sawed off by the hop and 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.610
 literally drive drive stuck here 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.610
 through these pipes 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.760
 further further what we did drilled 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.010
 put on this bolt on this bolt 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.770
 tightened 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.490
 made the cake turning now again 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.490
 lift up 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:08.290
 swivel bucket to be comfortable 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:15.340
 flint take out that's fine so he 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:18.060
 turns one way to another 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.449
 the side 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.449
 gray brother 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.649
 [music] 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:40.820
 fixed here set as 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:45.170
 winch the whole thing rises so well 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:49.330
 it seems I have told only one 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.370
 minus you know what when once 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.990
 raised once was 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:00.889
 to sit on a fight don't see where 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:04.190
 she climbs the cable pinches her alone 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.940
 once cut short when it came to the very end 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.250
 successfully cut the cable. 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.010
 I think later to remake 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.460
 construction through to put through the roller to 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.850
 top but I still think about it once 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:24.860
 so much used but still gonna know 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:29.229
 as far as raising well, but it would seem 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.229
 all all thanks, goodbye
