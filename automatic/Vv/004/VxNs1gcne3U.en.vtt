00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
you saw on the galaxy s3 so definitely

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
you saw on the galaxy s3 so definitely
design<00:00:30.060> wise<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.599> much<00:00:30.960> improved<00:00:31.140> when

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
design wise it is much improved when

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.889 
design wise it is much improved when
compared<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> original<00:00:32.430> or<00:00:33.000> let's<00:00:33.750> look

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
compared to the original or let's look

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
compared to the original or let's look
at<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> features<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
at some of the features that make this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
at some of the features that make this
galaxy<00:00:36.030> note<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.320> better<00:00:37.500> first

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
galaxy note so a little bit better first

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.049 
galaxy note so a little bit better first
of<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.340> any<00:00:38.430> only<00:00:38.670> designed<00:00:38.910> I

tons of things using the new S Pen and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.760 
tons of things using the new S Pen and
the<00:03:50.200> new<00:03:50.350> S<00:03:50.560> note

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.530 

you<00:03:55.280> can<00:03:55.430> also<00:03:55.550> jump<00:03:55.790> into<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.830> new<00:03:58.790> S<00:03:58.970> mode<00:03:59.240> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
you can also jump into a new S mode and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
you can also jump into a new S mode and
you<00:04:00.140> will<00:04:00.260> see<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.160> same<00:04:01.430> formulas<00:04:01.970> of

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
you will see that the same formulas of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640 
you will see that the same formulas of
the<00:04:02.300> formula<00:04:02.540> structure<00:04:02.990> that<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.260> saw<00:04:03.470> on

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
the formula structure that you saw on

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.520 
the formula structure that you saw on
the<00:04:03.770> galaxy<00:04:04.160> note<00:04:04.190> 10.1<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.870> being<00:04:06.140> brought<00:04:06.350> to

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
the galaxy note 10.1 is being brought to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.040 
the galaxy note 10.1 is being brought to
the<00:04:06.890> Galaxy<00:04:07.280> Note<00:04:07.310> 2<00:04:07.550> as<00:04:07.730> well<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.900> need

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
the Galaxy Note 2 as well so if I need

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.600 
the Galaxy Note 2 as well so if I need
to<00:04:09.170> enter<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> formula<00:04:09.740> all<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.100> need<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.340> do<00:04:10.520> is

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
to enter the formula all I need to do is

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.390 
to enter the formula all I need to do is
just<00:04:10.640> write<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.300> here

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.890 

and<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:17.120> will<00:04:17.209> show<00:04:17.359> up<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.570> formula<00:04:17.810> right

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
and it will show up the formula right

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.330 
and it will show up the formula right
I'm<00:04:19.019> another<00:04:19.350> screen<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.769> can<00:04:19.889> do<00:04:20.009> a<00:04:20.040> google

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
I'm another screen you can do a google

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.460 
I'm another screen you can do a google
search<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.120> even<00:04:21.239> remove<00:04:22.229> certain

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
search and you can even remove certain

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.510 
search and you can even remove certain
fields<00:04:22.949> and<00:04:24.080> enter<00:04:25.080> calculations<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.340> give

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
fields and enter calculations to give

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.719 
fields and enter calculations to give
you<00:04:26.610> answers

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.420 

so<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.419> get<00:04:34.569> Wolfram<00:04:35.080> Alpha<00:04:35.259> searches<00:04:35.889> for

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
so you get Wolfram Alpha searches for

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.930 
so you get Wolfram Alpha searches for
all<00:04:36.550> your<00:04:36.699> questions<00:04:37.029> and<00:04:37.180> answers

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
all your questions and answers

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.100 
all your questions and answers
so<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.630> same<00:04:39.840> kind<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.970> galaxy<00:04:41.970> s<00:04:42.510> note<00:04:42.810> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
so the same kind of galaxy s note the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.260 
so the same kind of galaxy s note the
juice<00:04:43.290> on<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.650> note<00:04:44.220> 10.1<00:04:44.430> has<00:04:44.970> been<00:04:45.120> brought

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
juice on the note 10.1 has been brought

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.340 
juice on the note 10.1 has been brought
to<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.570> Galaxy<00:04:45.900> Note<00:04:45.930> 2

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.250 

fine

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.110 

so<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.010> does<00:04:58.130> have<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> new<00:04:58.490> Exynos<00:04:58.790> quad

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
so it does have the new Exynos quad

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.380 
so it does have the new Exynos quad
processor<00:04:59.510> which<00:04:59.720> running<00:05:00.110> 1.6<00:05:00.530> gigahertz<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
processor which running 1.6 gigahertz it
