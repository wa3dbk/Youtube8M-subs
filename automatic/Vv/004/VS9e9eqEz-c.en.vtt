00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.190
 who counts it is work work work

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 hours if you have to go to bed at 10 pm 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 because ben 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.130
 mourning and urgently need to perform 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.720
 the command 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.160
 in fact the order if you do not have 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.050
 someone who motivates you behind and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.940
 which leads you from the top it's true that 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.860
 it is difficult it is we vary more 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.960
 big big support growing up at the cottage 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.340

 z in all the projects he always has me 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.860
 supported so it's true that 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.330
 we thought we were going to devote ourselves 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.520

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.110

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.250
 well launched for that we said 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.650
 now it's time to move on to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.310
 something else and then we said 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.770
 why not a little baby that would be the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.300
 concretization of 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.380
 of our personal life because he 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.710
 must have a personal life too 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.710
 it is important
