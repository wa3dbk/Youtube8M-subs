00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.400
 hello guys and girls that such but that 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.230
 ok let's see a game that I 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.340
 made yesterday with subscribers and with an angel 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.090
 dark another goal to power 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.400
 and we were playing here in infected 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.949
 when when the good colleague tells me 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.929
 I said I really go to I do not know where to 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.570
 see if we can hold there a little bit 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.379
 and he said no no 2020 here between here 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.420
 I say good we see the other site different 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.579
 to which I said obviously there we are 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.180
 in orange those that we were in in the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.629
 departure 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.030
 We were Carlos Angel Dark Angel Yo 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.399
 and well I said fuck and uncle this one 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.710
 He has been here longer and he has not played 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.440
 a lot but it takes more time than I go 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.840
 to pay attention to it, not me, here I would say 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.300
 let's go down to I do not know where and 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.149
 needs we do not go there and good 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.269
 so come when I was still going for my 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.340
 site here I was still going here I 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.990
 where he said they are left will not be here in 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.810
 these stairs that could not climb us 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 from behind 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.490
 and well here I had endured I had 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.259
 already done a couple of gusts of 15 and 20 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.040
 out there deservedly here look 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.230
 simply here and well then 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.000
 there right where the cement blocks 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.030
 this then I went there says we're going to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.320
 listen to him they were here and they told me 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.900
 look is that if you get behind the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.900
 blocks these nothing you see the team 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.720
 we are here says I cover this part you 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.870
 covers in the other and a little between 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.600
 four since we keep the area safe 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.590
 not so good then we started 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.820
 wait here for colleagues because the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.030
 truth is that this game mode to 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.610
 principle I do not know the truth is that it has 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.270
 his grace not that there is only one and such 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.000
 but then when making a video 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.649
 for example now because this is this piece 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.330
 starting in which we are like this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.880
 practically standing waiting for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.030
 someone appears 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.340
 it's pretty boring because we do not 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.840
 it works when uploading a video not 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.640
 not worth 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.950
 I can not justify in a way 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 effective the minute and a half two minutes 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.420
 I'm going to be here quiet waiting for 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.160
 that people come is that it is absurd 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.160
 it's practically here shooting for 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.840
 see if they saw us and came 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 look there one appears 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.160
 a charge I did not remember that the truth is 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.200
 what do I already tell you that these are 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.269
 minutes well they seem a bit like a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.600
 little bit of a pain in the ass when not 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.280
 no they are not so much because 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.660
 you're here waiting if you're with 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.670
 colleagues, you're talking, you're 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.230
 throwing a laugh I do not know what to do before the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 other but if you're alone or you're watching 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.250
 a video because it does not have not so much 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.400
 grace there is no what I call there is 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.950
 a colleague of ours one of antonio carlos 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.010
 one of the two calluses 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.480
 and good then when playing the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.040
 true that yes that works not 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.260
 because you are there with such tension and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.849
 which I am a restless ass and I like 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.190
 go look for them look here we can not 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.390
 stop does not consist of face standing still 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.540
 I have to go find them 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.760
 but well still I can not stand it and the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.370
 mouths to the colleague and I stay in the area 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.580
 of charge two or three if I step back to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 so I do not go far and well 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.430
 within what can be maintained 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.549
 controlled is this entry 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.530
 and he is here giving chicha zalgiris 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.700
 it has a little easier but the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.579
 truth is that a lot less people are coming 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.640
 over there so it does not make up for having it 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.620
 so easy is a little good they have it more 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.420
 easy but you're going to make fewer casualties 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.370
 so much so that you will have less fun 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.819
 the truth is that I stayed in this 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.620
 side that looks like it's the funniest 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.150
 the one that most stimulates you not at the time of 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.459
 play because more people come to you 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.290
 the two parts of the truck can you 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.300
 come for the two parts of the truck that 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.709
 well, that's two parts, but yes, 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.120
 outposts like you're doing and 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.190
 now you can get caught with the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.230
 back 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.890
 and well, always with a little bit of 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.720
 Good luck not to eat some throwaway 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.940
 because the throwers do not give you ever 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.180
 until they give you because it's like that 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.630
 I do not know a little strip in 70 throws 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.680
 well some of clear wandering obviously 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.020
 thrown in here we were defending the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.539
 zone 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.210
 a subscriber told me one of the two 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.620
 guys who were with us after 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.349
 Carlos, I think it was Carlos, but well, 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.629
 I know if it was exactly what he said is not 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.069
 that when you're here hiding behind 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.449
 the cement blocks I think it was 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.490
 Carlos to all this I do not know 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.469
 says these are behind the outbreaks of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.210
 cement are in the head with 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:03.930
 throwing trunks so you have in the 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.689
 head with thrown behind a block 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.610
 come on you have to know how to subtract a lot and 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.309
 Well, I think he was infected 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.150
 I think he was in the low we had 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:20.589
 in the infected that was our of 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.150
 our group and I think it was 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:26.289
 wishing to hit us in the head with the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.969
 'red' I say but I did not get it and well 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.199
 here you see that love that I do not 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.900
 I expected the truth we were from 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.110
 aquivaldo and the truth is that I like in 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.520
 modern warfare 2 finish a little tired of 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.229
 the fashions the good ones of the fashions in 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.069
 this case of nuclear bombs not 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.080
 I ended up a little tired because I took it 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.060
 practically in all the games 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.039
 it was practically a race for 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.289
 that whoever took it out before 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.699
 between your colleagues and you was a 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.430
 race to see who took it before 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.169
 and of course you were looking for me here 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.249
 I'm finding obviously I'm 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.780
 playing this game mode that is pretty 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.880
 easier than after kick 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.080
 I'm finding without looking for them and maybe 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.150
 be what I am having fun 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.490
 get me out is wrong so nothing that ends 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.230
 the video I hope you liked it 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.540
 listen to your colleagues even more if 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.350
 they know more than you and even the 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.350
 next chau chau
