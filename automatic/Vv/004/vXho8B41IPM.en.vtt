00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.960
 by not doing others about humans that 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.310
 they went to the moon and find a race 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.790
 alien that seeks to destroy the earth 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.310
 and that is another anime but it has a very 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 design of my house or that is to be called vale 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.970
 brave to not make another about human 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 they came to Mars and they found 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.930
 with mutant cockroaches humanity is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.150
 black you are with three legs and that is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 another story but if it's from Mars or 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.070
 yahyá yahyá that there are mecas there at noa 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 tells us about humans being 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.270
 they found in the moon a mystic portal 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.680
 to Mars and the rest is history you know 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.629
 what humans do when they get to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.039
 a new planet now that the series is 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.649
 advanced and already has seven chapters 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.479
 Well they got the clear good conclusion 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.429
 clear and without adding the impressions of 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.079
 tokyo I'm going to change here but in this 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.550
 case we are talking about euros water not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's something that can be taken lightly 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.449
 as saying or is unanimous and great the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.280
 same reason why I have not pulled out 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.829
 no sanction or terror we are 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.659
 talking about ginger watanabe and yoko cando 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.100
 apart from that he keeps trying to find 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.679
 good things to the anime but in short 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.299
 started we got action action and more 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.219
 action giving a good first impression 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.320
 to food but suffered what I call 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.550
 the syndrome demos love will ask 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 what is that then 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 and it works in the following way we 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.340
 they give three super good chapters that only 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 with thinking about them makes me have a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.510
 erection equal if you are a woman and you know it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 three excellent chapters so that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 then do not come with the bullshit that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 the protagonist is the bastard son of 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.020
 miley see and want the press that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.060
 camera john is going to suffer the brother has 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.780
 to die and that there are no other letters in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.430
 Mars 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.350
 in fact the anime does not have much and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.360
 It's hard for me to say it but for people 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 they like it's not because of the plot itself is what 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.810
 same that happened to criticize even what 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.690
 surprise guess who works in the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.550
 music is water no friends do not confuse 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.050
 a good plot when they see they are drag the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.370
 only reason why hit and crown of 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.440
 tone like a prostitute in abstinence 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.020
 it's because the music makes it look like 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.400
 epic think about it well we put music 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.260
 it's water not in a clip of someone 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.300
 eating a sandwich and let's see 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.890
 Jesus Christ riding dinosaur is there 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
 in shitting and we see chabelo in the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 Mexican revolution is someone 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.770
 doing the task that divide we see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.050
 Exactly the children turtles with the power 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.490
 We rangers stay brushing teeth and 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.430
 we see the campaign of special 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.900
 impossible that for me that peak is now 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.660
 here they have the music and I said only the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.810
 plot I do not know what you saw but I 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.270
 I saw my dance when I came out of sixth 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 I'm still traumatized and I do not want me 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.739
 misunderstand the series is good and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
 It entertains a lot but I can not 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.489
 remove from the head that without you 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.959
 water would not have serious problems in the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.270
 good things we can find the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.340
 animation is simply amazing 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.410
 almost ended up convulsing on the floor by 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060
 those effects on the other hand is the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.280
 classic style of euro bus directing 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.560
 with the camera moving away to impact or 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.450
 put every scene and every thing just 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.150
 when it has to be put like every 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.920
 chapter is a game and marvich with a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660
 distinctive hallmark of the chapter name 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.760
 until the end are things that to screen 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.590
 the good thing is that it gives the realism of being 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 inside the anime and not feel like a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.030
 spectator but again I have to 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.830
 say and it's thanks to the music in the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.319
 The negative part is that they look like Alejandro 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.340
 that is resistance 1297 says that that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.959
 plagiarized space battleship yamato called 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.690
 but joaquin instead is defined 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.330
 has says it's a tribute do not notice 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.890
 please the quotes in tribute and that 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.080
 you tell me that Mexicas look like 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.180
 those of mufflers but good yes it is true not 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.739
 it is in bad taste to do that is past in 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.580
 the part of naruto with that loss of 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.470
 live cobo 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.230
 and in hundreds of other animals that I 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.330
 he said act neither to refute his veracity 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.250
 whether or not true what the tribute is 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.440
 refers must go almost unnoticed 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.850
 just so that the followers who 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.850
 I would think that this fight would be a trial 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.990
 bebop but good is defined as land 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.460
 following the animal not steel under 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.440
 quite quality chapter 3 in 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.970
 forward is cool that the son 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.110
 of maribel can defeat them with a 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.940
 robot of practices and a container 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.620
 flying but it's not a good idea about 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.820
 to explode it seems the only carrier 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.290
 food 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.060
 and remember that stream that stays 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.800
 with the chameleon princess it is assumed that 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.090
 it has to be the second prota and what 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.280
 The only thing he gets is that he wants it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.160
 kill the next thing I will say is personal 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.590
 it is predictable knowing the genre buzzi 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.959
 you can identify and with this one matches 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.600
 My friend arthur lover assistance 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.850
 steps to meet the norwich and one 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.620
 nothing is what it seems if you want 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.750
 that something is what you think is wrong is 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.070
 quite the opposite for example is to say 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.410
 the when brad pitt in miniature 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.450
 real machismo of the old man happens that everything 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.880
 it's a plot normally something happened 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.070
 like this something will go wrong can not 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.489
 to be that easy is badly said and 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.650
 fact 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.580
 everything is worth whistle making the second 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 prota have to leave as fart 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.569
 accused of treason and when the 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.729
 encourage that end and with your great intelligence 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.620
 almighty told me that the blonde is 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.210
 had to be against or in favor of 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.189
 son of a macgyver I told him that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.050
 would be against think it well and you 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.000
 together with the prota not only would have the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.159
 princess also to that subject 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.110
 balancing the balance I say that it is 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.520
 He buzzi what he said we have to do 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.740
 that the exploration of humanity without 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.629
 reason but at the same time it looks cool and so 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.090
 will put the protas against so that we 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:55.979
 help and be more epic and this was what 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.110
 said his wife now that he passed the dance his 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.270
 will recognize your prediction at the end 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.490
 several end die in an attempt by 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.229
 stop the enemies and how they failed 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.759
 the attempts of the prota to defeat them 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.800
 with a gosh and pieces of clothing 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.319
 joins with the blonde and after a 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.909
 scene and today they attack if that happens to be 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.460
 from god point number 2 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.900
 his need to protest and that thing that 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 have at the end of the chapter to 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.779
 want to see the next I know he has a 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.669
 name in English but I do not remember 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.189
 anime you always had to tell me who is 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.560
 hard buzzi point number 3 again with 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.360
 the music and I will stop bothering with this 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.400
 Uruguay knows how to like its 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.290
 Address skills with music 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.270
 the music director feels that 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.520
 they make lovers for that moment that's 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.229
 perfect, what does not seem right to me? 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.320
 it's like there's a fucking song every 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.389
 five minutes is unanimous not a mv le 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.449
 it happens the same k lite crowne for 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.039
 finalize this anime is good though 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.900
 look like you're missing out with I know 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.090
 no terror this is not a rival for not doing 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.949
 or yes that the genres are different but 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.660
 we have to admit it by not doing or 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.699
 Wins the boring plot of 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.680
 your rival because there can not be love 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.690
 Between Uruguay and Watanabe nothing would be the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.310
 anime more chingón of the history and in 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.990
 community here I leave the video not what 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.550
 I wanted to be long but I have so many things 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.560
 what to say by not doing what it costs me 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.090
 summarize it in about 8 or 10 minutes I do not know 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.500
 When will the video after it has been 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.210
 liked and my intention is to offend 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.860
 no fan boy just wanted to give my point 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.300
 of opinion so he defended himself and 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.500
 excuse me remember that my networks 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.330

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.220
