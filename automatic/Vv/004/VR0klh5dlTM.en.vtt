00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.060
 When we talk about January, we talk. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.830
 will prioritize views you do not have a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.040
 province of the sea ​​but also has 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.440
 stone you have a type of vegetation 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.380
 very interesting very peculiar 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.380
 food is tropical there next door 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.399
 there he was super well located in 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.399
 island coast 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 only he was very dense it is very 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.950
 down then had a view 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 We went up a house to have a view 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.420
 but the one of this ample and total to the promar 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.760
 and this made the project 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 really something else of a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 great value neither in this nor has 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 Also this house is the kitchen she has to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 close and dinner at the top is a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 office suite bathroom in the bathroom 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.820
 also an important part of this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 volume because he knows to keep sight 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 the privacy of this issue of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.750
 privacy has also generated a 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 house that the person enters through a gallery 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 and do not know very well what to expect 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.680
 We change our right foot when we come in. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 in the room to give this impression has a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.670
 the big arena there, the whole arena 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.799
 front for greater visibility 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.520
 you see every 100 coating it already 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.329
 she had all this lightness and she's strong 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.289
 because only by her own waist is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.530
 reflected in the program 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.299
 in her house a mixed structure she has 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.659
 a part of the other metal structure 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.630
 part is conventional structure of 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.209
 concrete to metallica transparent agent 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 and the investment materials are the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.830
 which is a clear wood that is used in the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.140
 facade on the mech floor and a natural stone 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.510
 you are in the middle of the rainforest 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.940
 side the stone of the gávea chicken brand say 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 Yes, and the ones you try to use 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.260
 materials that in any way with the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.840
 time they mimic themselves a bit with 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.190
 this landscape or the stone is the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:43.720
 Neon wood and the pool blue that I wanted 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.880
 mix with 11 sea ​​with the sky and I think 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.329
 which is a bit of of every thing but 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.130
 always with this idea of ​​not hurting the 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:57.209
 landscape in this house, people 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.639
 Can you do something that we have? 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.519
 that take away that living room and external 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.139
 on the balcony but open the living room and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.359
 you do not as one knows where the 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.930
 banana in the terminal speaks that is you 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.549
 entire user the ports all of them are 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.959
 Has a boss is super light to 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.540
 disappear as closed and when 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.630
 open them then beyond the walls the 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.180
 two sides and we kept the same 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.660
 floor treatment to the same pool 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.359
 in pool in detail against water 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.720
 and has already insisted on maintaining this 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.720
 goal 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.560
 of course 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.390
 placed the whole house a new house 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.819
 but it is clearly use because I have 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.540
 cross motivation he has the breeze 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.690
 of the sea in your event the wind coming out as 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.450
 if you had a balcony and that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.220
 only the best lighting comes from behind 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.040
 in the bedrooms then we think 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.480
 from this opening and in front they have the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.340
 this is not a house she goes to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.260
 know how to age very well 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.090
 I believe that in 10 years she will 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.609
 be much more interested in contracting 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.190
 today committed from the office exactly 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.400
 understand where you are going where 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.230
 you have consumed your homes and 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.680
 improve the lives of those who 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.680
 be in there
