honest it's just one and here as I look
down<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:42.049> iron<00:02:42.200> sights<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.680> going<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.859> try<00:02:42.950> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
down the iron sights I'm going to try to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.039 
down the iron sights I'm going to try to
put<00:02:43.189> it<00:02:43.280> as<00:02:43.400> close<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.970> camera<00:02:44.299> as<00:02:44.480> I

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
put it as close to the camera as I

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.819 
put it as close to the camera as I
possibly<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:48.139> there<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.379> is<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.620> know<00:02:48.739> if

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
possibly can so there it is you know if

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.160 
possibly can so there it is you know if
you've<00:02:48.920> got<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.159> slanted<00:02:49.790> mhk<00:02:50.569> sight
