00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 I bought here in Brazil and abroad. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.640
 I'll put this corner and microphone in the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.640
 Cashier

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.300
 microphone used on the mac can also be 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.940
 used a notebook computer etc. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 So we'll open it and have to open it. 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.410
 here carefully 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:28.570
 I do not know how I'm going to open your 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:28.570
 page over here 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:49.330
 I did not want to just box 00 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.080
 Finally I'm sorry, and if you 're not 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.790
 very focused on the camera because I 'm 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:37.970
 seeing the image that I 'm recording old 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:37.970
 type and is too heavy will even 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:04:04.980
 his tripod's microphone 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:23.539
 so flex as you go 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:26.539
 opening and closing the curls here to 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.539
 you 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:37.280
 so it's just there, it 's just rock 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.540
 that's right 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:57.350
 Raining well, we had beauty there. 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.780
 now it 's just that the usb cable is not 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.930
 who comes here at your door had here 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.780
 Behind him, I think it 's the same and there 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.240
 put pc and started and type like 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.200
 You must be thinking I said that I 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 I bought a business that is very clear. 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.830
 to lose out and I paid for people 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.510
 Do you think that in Brazil I was very lucky? 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.430
 I do not know why this price was too high 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.830
 good for me because I would care 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.440
 He and I needed to have already bought a 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.660
 iphone new as i tape a crooked o 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.340
 Bug is there to do what I do. 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.590
 so sometimes it is not the best option of the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.230
 no matter how much he has a 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.420
 sound quality it's up to 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.850
 So whats a little speck for you to see? 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.200
 now in a and there the quality was kind 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.090
 which, in some respects, for me 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.670
 so I decided to take it with was a little 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.890
 better a little more clear who should 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.330
 to improve the quality of the channel 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.010
 so this is it people I'm really happy 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.100
 to have made this microphone was very 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.660
 rare to even get here in Brazil and 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.530
 specifications and do not know if it's for 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.490
 You see here saying that windows 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.520
 mobile 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.550
 basic things on usb port 1.0 and 2.0 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.650
 so it's a snap to a microphone that 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.900
 runs on all computers 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.860
 practically even as I said in the 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.180
 start of video 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.070
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.080
 had tanned and more in boxing here at 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.850
 view the channel if you likes please 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.320
 I do not like subscribing to networks. 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.200
 social to enjoy the facebook page 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.950
 and also evaluated the video here that is the 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.900
 more important 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.820
 Ok then, a hug to everyone and stay with 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.360
 God and until the next video said 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.360
