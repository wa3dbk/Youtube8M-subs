00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349 
diagram and traffic lights 1 through 6
are<00:00:25.140> shown<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.650> top<00:00:26.130> with<00:00:26.400> distances<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
are shown on top with distances on the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.190 
are shown on top with distances on the
bottom<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:30.240> between<00:00:31.170> lights<00:00:31.619> 2<00:00:32.250> &amp;<00:00:32.809> 6

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
bottom so we know between lights 2 &amp; 6

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.119 
bottom so we know between lights 2 &amp; 6
it<00:00:34.980> takes<00:00:35.489> 35<00:00:36.210> seconds<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.590> between<00:00:37.860> those

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it takes 35 seconds to get between those

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
it takes 35 seconds to get between those
two<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> simply<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> problem<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
two and so this is simply a problem of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.229 
two and so this is simply a problem of
knowing<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.700> lights<00:00:44.969> turn

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
knowing that when these lights turn

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.650 
knowing that when these lights turn
green

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
green

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.380 
green
it<00:00:46.350> takes<00:00:46.620> 35<00:00:47.129> seconds<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> go<00:00:47.850> between<00:00:48.030> lights

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it takes 35 seconds to go between lights

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
it takes 35 seconds to go between lights
2<00:00:48.629> &amp;<00:00:48.930> 6<00:00:49.340> 2<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.640> 6<00:00:51.680> lights<00:00:52.680> between<00:00:53.219> 1<00:00:53.399> &amp;<00:00:53.550> 2<00:00:53.579> is

2 &amp; 6 2 to 6 lights between 1 &amp; 2 is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.240 
2 &amp; 6 2 to 6 lights between 1 &amp; 2 is
just<00:00:54.000> given<00:00:54.660> us<00:00:54.920> confusion<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just given us confusion for you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
just given us confusion for you
hopefully<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:58.260> use<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
hopefully you don't use that then you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.740 
hopefully you don't use that then you
just<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:01.579> equation<00:01:02.579> velocity<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.510> distance

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
just use equation velocity is distance

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.460 
just use equation velocity is distance
over<00:01:04.290> time<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.780> distance<00:01:07.020> between

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
over time so your distance between

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
over time so your distance between
lights<00:01:07.860> 2<00:01:08.250> &amp;<00:01:08.520> 6<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.650> 100<00:01:10.650> feet<00:01:10.860> plus<00:01:11.280> 180<00:01:12.119> feet

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
lights 2 &amp; 6 is 100 feet plus 180 feet

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
lights 2 &amp; 6 is 100 feet plus 180 feet
plus<00:01:12.930> 200<00:01:13.680> feet<00:01:14.070> plus<00:01:15.060> 75<00:01:15.900> feet<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.500> divided

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
plus 200 feet plus 75 feet all divided

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
plus 200 feet plus 75 feet all divided
by<00:01:17.220> 35<00:01:17.759> seconds<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.920> gives<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.350> 555

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
by 35 seconds and that gives you 555

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
by 35 seconds and that gives you 555
feet<00:01:22.770> divided<00:01:23.400> by<00:01:23.549> 35<00:01:24.210> seconds<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:26.250> gives<00:01:26.460> me

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
feet divided by 35 seconds it gives me

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.880 
feet divided by 35 seconds it gives me
fifteen<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:28.080> eight<00:01:28.759> six<00:01:29.780> feet<00:01:30.780> per<00:01:31.320> second

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
fifteen point eight six feet per second

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.390 
fifteen point eight six feet per second
but<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> answer<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.530> miles<00:01:34.860> per

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
but the answer they want is in miles per

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.270 
but the answer they want is in miles per
hour<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> make<00:01:37.229> sure<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.500> screw<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.070> on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
hour so make sure you don't screw up on

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
hour so make sure you don't screw up on
that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.900> guess<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> might<00:01:40.200> choose<00:01:40.470> C<00:01:40.950> that's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that I guess you might choose C that's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.899 
that I guess you might choose C that's
kind<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> close<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:44.670> you're

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
kind of close but not really if you're

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
kind of close but not really if you're
using<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.600> civil<00:01:45.960> engineering<00:01:46.290> reference

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
using the civil engineering reference

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
using the civil engineering reference
manual<00:01:47.070> there's<00:01:47.250> nice<00:01:47.490> conversions<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
manual there's nice conversions of the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.340 
manual there's nice conversions of the
front<00:01:48.540> cover<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> those<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:52.170> can

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
front cover and one of those is you can

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
front cover and one of those is you can
convert<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.520> feet<00:01:53.759> per<00:01:53.909> second<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> miles

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
convert from feet per second to miles

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
convert from feet per second to miles
per<00:01:54.630> hour<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> take<00:01:55.439> fifteen<00:01:55.829> point<00:01:56.130> eight

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
per hour so you take fifteen point eight

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
per hour so you take fifteen point eight
six<00:01:56.610> feet<00:01:57.000> per<00:01:57.270> second<00:01:58.009> multiply<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
six feet per second multiply it by a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.789 
six feet per second multiply it by a
conversion<00:01:59.579> factor<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.479> zero<00:02:00.810> point<00:02:01.140> six

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
conversion factor of zero point six

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.450 
conversion factor of zero point six
eight<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.579> eight<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:04.409> gives<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.070> ten

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
eight one eight and that gives you ten

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.609 
eight one eight and that gives you ten
point<00:02:05.969> eight<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.869> miles<00:02:07.350> per<00:02:08.069> hour

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
point eight one miles per hour

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.490 
point eight one miles per hour
and<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.280> answer<00:02:10.640> B<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.180> guess<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.290> could

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and that is answer B I guess you could

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.390 
and that is answer B I guess you could
screw<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.040> answer<00:02:13.459> up<00:02:13.700> by<00:02:14.349> putting<00:02:15.349> 150<00:02:16.160> in

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
screw this answer up by putting 150 in

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.820 
screw this answer up by putting 150 in
for<00:02:16.670> distance<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:18.200> would<00:02:18.319> give<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.650> wrong

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
for distance that would give you a wrong

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.380 
for distance that would give you a wrong
answer<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.800> we<00:02:22.069> don't<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.209> hope

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
