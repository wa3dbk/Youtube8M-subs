something<00:01:23.180> was<00:01:23.330> different<00:01:23.540> something<00:01:23.930> was

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
something was different something was

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.990 
something was different something was
wrong<00:01:24.380> well<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.860> guess<00:01:28.220> I'm<00:01:28.520> when

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
wrong well not really I guess I'm when

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.640 
wrong well not really I guess I'm when
my<00:01:29.180> mum<00:01:29.420> found<00:01:29.690> out<00:01:29.870> was<00:01:30.020> when<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.260> found<00:01:30.500> out

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
my mum found out was when I found out

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.960 
my mum found out was when I found out
because<00:01:30.770> she<00:01:30.980> never<00:01:31.160> really<00:01:31.400> kept<00:01:31.610> secrets

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
because she never really kept secrets

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.080 
because she never really kept secrets
from<00:01:32.060> me<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.870> when<00:01:33.800> I<00:01:33.860> was<00:01:34.190> growing<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.790> where

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
from me and when I was growing up where

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.110 
from me and when I was growing up where
I<00:01:35.120> lived<00:01:35.540> when<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.320> was<00:01:36.590> younger<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.670> was<00:01:37.820> very

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
I lived when I was younger it was very

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.950 
I lived when I was younger it was very
sort<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:40.060> difficult<00:01:41.060> time<00:01:41.300> because<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.720> was

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
sort of difficult time because I was

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.810 
sort of difficult time because I was
changing<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.560> lot<00:01:42.710> with<00:01:42.860> different<00:01:43.250> people<00:01:43.640> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
changing a lot with different people and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580 
changing a lot with different people and
it<00:01:43.940> was<00:01:44.030> all<00:01:44.150> very<00:01:44.270> hyperactive<00:01:44.750> no<00:01:45.170> rules<00:01:45.410> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
it was all very hyperactive no rules and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.740 
it was all very hyperactive no rules and
boundaries<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.400> guess<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:47.420> narrowly

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
boundaries so I guess that narrowly

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.340 
boundaries so I guess that narrowly
hoped<00:01:48.880> let<00:01:49.880> me<00:01:50.000> ask<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.050> could<00:01:51.230> you

hoped let me ask you this and could you
explain<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.860> us<00:01:51.890> what<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.150> consequence<00:01:53.870> of

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
explain to us what is the consequence of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.800 
explain to us what is the consequence of
this<00:01:54.770> syndrome<00:01:55.190> what<00:01:55.490> what<00:01:56.390> where<00:01:56.540> does<00:01:56.660> it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
this syndrome what what where does it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.700 
this syndrome what what where does it
affect<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:58.910> guess<00:01:59.870> it<00:02:00.080> affects<00:02:00.380> my<00:02:00.650> ability

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
affect you I guess it affects my ability

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.350

I<00:02:06.010> present<00:02:07.010> well<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.670> can<00:02:07.940> obviously<00:02:08.599> right

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I present well and I can obviously right

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.690 
I present well and I can obviously right
well<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.709> creative<00:02:10.160> things

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
well you know I do creative things

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.640 
well you know I do creative things
but<00:02:11.120> other<00:02:11.420> things<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.900> remember<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.320> lock<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
but other things I remember to lock the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.780 
but other things I remember to lock the
door<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> house<00:02:13.520> or

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
door and I go out the house or

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.130 
door and I go out the house or
remembering<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.300> pick<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.600> my<00:02:14.720> keys<00:02:14.900> or

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
remembering to pick up my keys or

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220 
remembering to pick up my keys or
whatever<00:02:15.260> that's<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.480> short<00:02:17.480> short-term

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
whatever that's just a short short-term

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.640 
whatever that's just a short short-term
memory<00:02:18.770> then<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.340> difficult<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:20.390> just

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
memory then it's difficult it's just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.810 
memory then it's difficult it's just
remembering<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.860> common<00:02:22.250> sense<00:02:22.490> things<00:02:22.700> I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
remembering the common sense things I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.950 
remembering the common sense things I
guess<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.180> not<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.510> there

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
guess it's not really there

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.270 
guess it's not really there
and<00:02:24.050> that's<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.380> most<00:02:24.530> frustrating<00:02:24.680> thing

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
and that's the most frustrating thing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.200 
and that's the most frustrating thing
about<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.420> don't<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.560> look<00:02:28.550> right<00:02:28.850> to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
about it is that I don't I look right to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.490 
about it is that I don't I look right to
professionals<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.050> that's<00:02:30.170> where<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
professionals and that's where the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.870 
professionals and that's where the
problem<00:02:30.800> comes<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.190> they<00:02:31.460> can't<00:02:31.730> see

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
problem comes in because they can't see

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.980 
problem comes in because they can't see
that<00:02:32.000> there's<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.240> problem<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.570> go<00:02:32.690> she's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
that there's a problem they go she's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.020 
that there's a problem they go she's
fine<00:02:33.200> she<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.560> hold<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.220> conversation<00:02:34.400> she's

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
fine she can hold a conversation she's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.540 
fine she can hold a conversation she's
great<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:39.770> if<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.370> said
