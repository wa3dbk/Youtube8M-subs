00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.290
 gas adjustment gas gas 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.170
 gearbox 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.690
 atiker second solenoid valve I mean 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 called electronic gear won he 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 Worth to know what is in this gearbox 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.590
 two screws one copper screwdriver 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.719
 the top is standing and the second is plastic 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.480
 jazz show it here she is plump 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:42.620
 plastic in my screw of greed 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.850
 They call it so and 2 regulation on our 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.750
 the page is worth that is the first second 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:55.940
 camera is our principle what when we are all 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:58.170
 set this one screw copper 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.480
 twist all the way unscrew 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:09.350
 literally three four turns 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.570
 so plastic here is this screw 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.420
 unscrew the middle position that is 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 as far as possible and unscrew the maximum 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.210
 middle position back spin in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.159
 average bet 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:31.310
 unscrew these two screws to the maximum 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.310
 for starters, he starts the engine and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.950
 here is this plastic screw slowly 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.569
 the fact that he reacts with and is late he 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 a little bit in store whether that is twisted 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.679
 waited spun waited start 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.829
 catch the maximum momentum 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.289
 engine 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.450
 that is, to turn him there and either he 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.000
 gasping begins to stall either in 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.759
 find another middle ground 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 maximum speed that's when found 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.479
 maximum speed copper screw 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.650
 do the same thing start it 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.810
 spin a little bit 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.900
 that is, how can you say it like 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.180
 idle this screw 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.299
 here twist too twist 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.950
 spin it a little bit 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.840
 catch and cleanliness of the engine so that it is not 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.459
 yanked the thread or the floor that is ideally 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.090
 expose and then regulate 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.040
 the first camera i.e. tighten the screw 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.859
 until she starts choking and by 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.400
 slightly unscrew it while 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:50.169
 you start the engine you have a mistake on 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.099
 press accelerator gas and here's how 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:56.650
 stops choking ie you clicked a 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.690
 small she develops poorly 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.859
 still unscrewed the first camera slightly 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.819
 again and until you reach the ideal 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.190
 plan was equipped she reacted here 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.069
 The second camera is already well, as if to stand on 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.609
 the place and the backwater to tear the motor is not particularly 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:20.410
 I want so go on the road here and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:23.680
 just jackdaw gas push to the floor I mean 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.690
 open the second camera and how it holds 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.819
 someone is the same that is cog by 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.629
 slightly from let go either for 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.910
 twist 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.300
 that's something like you and everything in general 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.840
 adjustment that's when you stand these two 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.200
 screw 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.400
 she goes all well he can 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.440
 arise planets have these screws 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.489
 changed may change the engine 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.019
 idle 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.299
 you again literally plastic screw 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.450
 half turn there 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.450
 half turn back expose again 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.760
 maximum speed 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.530
 Well, and such a cog when you put 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.280
 maximum momentum and maybe a little bit 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.000
 put out the same thing with this cog 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.660
 a little bit like this 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 the secondary screw you have is the jet 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.750
 Chick the main thing is plastic 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.850
 a hog standing here actually 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.660
 all all adjustment 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.680
 there is nothing military in the gearbox 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:46.330
 everything is very simple I collected it all myself 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.910
 maybe unprofessional but for myself 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.570
 did that is to the max 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.289
 less snot all this neatly 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.289
 laid down 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.280
 This moment works like a watch with 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.110
 I do not know the flow rate 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 here in terms of these rifles clamp them 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.570
 there is no sense there to suppress the second camera 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.060
 clamp that is let the best of both 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.020
 it works then you enjoy a little bit 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.389
 just clicked she would easily run away if you 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.229
 want to save so she ate less 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.090
 it will give you nothing 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:31.450
 you just sort of accelerate it longer 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.490
 brisk will not be enough but for so and so 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.889
 further so the best you she will take 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.360
 as much as she needs 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.360
 plan is not to worry 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.989
 that's all
