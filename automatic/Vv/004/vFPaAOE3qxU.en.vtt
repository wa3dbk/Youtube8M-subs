I'm going to take that opacity down to
zero

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
zero

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
zero
and<00:01:32.689> mess<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:33.960> filters<00:01:35.840> which<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and mess with these filters which is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.700 
and mess with these filters which is
really<00:01:37.229> cool<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 

contrast<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.960> ahead<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.229> hit<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
contrast and go ahead and hit the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.060 
contrast and go ahead and hit the
checkmark

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
checkmark

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
can head on over the patterns so you

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.840 
can head on over the patterns so you
open<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:51.990> patterns<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.190> add<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
open up patterns and you can add a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390 
open up patterns and you can add a
pattern<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.200> background<00:01:55.619> map<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.190> it's

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
pattern to your background map and it's

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.330 
pattern to your background map and it's
already<00:01:56.729> automatic<00:01:57.210> cut<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.509> by<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.930> shape

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
already automatic cut out by your shape

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.980 
already automatic cut out by your shape
of<00:01:59.340> course<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.909> increase<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.659> size<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of course you can increase the size of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.290 
of course you can increase the size of
this<00:02:01.140> rotate<00:02:01.830> your<00:02:01.950> pattern<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.580> move<00:02:03.119> your

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
this rotate your pattern and move your

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.010 
this rotate your pattern and move your
