exactly<00:00:08.970> how<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> kill<00:00:09.510> blood<00:00:09.780> builds<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> has

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
exactly how to kill blood builds it has

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.799 
exactly how to kill blood builds it has
not<00:00:10.590> changed<00:00:11.190> much<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.880> most<00:00:12.120> efficient<00:00:12.630> way

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
not changed much the most efficient way

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
not changed much the most efficient way
since<00:00:13.080> before<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.650> evolution<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.130> combat

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
since before the evolution of combat

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
since before the evolution of combat
however<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.570> felt<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> need<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:17.100> show

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
however I just felt the need to to show

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
however I just felt the need to to show
them<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> lot<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> people<00:00:18.600> actually

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
them because a lot of people actually

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
them because a lot of people actually
skip<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> blood<00:00:19.710> Vale<00:00:19.920> task<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.490> don't

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
skip the blood Vale task and they don't

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.689 
skip the blood Vale task and they don't
know<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> good<00:00:22.410> task<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
know what a good task it actually is to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
know what a good task it actually is to
do<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.029> could<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> quite<00:00:24.480> rewarding<00:00:24.750> so

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
coots because the blood votes use a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
combat but you just want to stand

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.970 
combat but you just want to stand
roughly<00:03:09.629> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.900> middle<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.470> area<00:03:10.799> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
roughly in the middle of the area and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.210 
roughly in the middle of the area and
set<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.370> your<00:03:11.400> cannon<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.739> course<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.890> cannon

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
set up your cannon of course the cannon

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.879 
set up your cannon of course the cannon
is<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.640> required<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.049> does<00:03:16.260> help<00:03:16.530> speed

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
is not required but it does help speed

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.069 
is not required but it does help speed
up<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.130> task<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.579> lot<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.269> only<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:19.049> of

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
up the task a lot this is only one of

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.620 
up the task a lot this is only one of
two<00:03:19.230> tasks<00:03:19.919> that<00:03:20.010> actually<00:03:20.489> cannon<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.090> feel

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
two tasks that actually cannon I feel

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
two tasks that actually cannon I feel
like<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.650> most<00:03:22.859> worth<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
like this is one of the most worth it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.789 
like this is one of the most worth it
tasks<00:03:23.730> -<00:03:23.819> cannon<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.260> drops<00:03:25.530> aren't

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
tasks - cannon because the drops aren't

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.890 
tasks - cannon because the drops aren't
great<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> XP<00:03:26.849> isn't<00:03:27.180> amazing<00:03:27.569> without<00:03:27.690> a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
great and the XP isn't amazing without a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.750 
great and the XP isn't amazing without a
cannon<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.530> pretty<00:03:28.739> good<00:03:29.010> with<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.370> and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
cannon but it's pretty good with one and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.319 
cannon but it's pretty good with one and
then<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.720> fire<00:03:31.109> your<00:03:31.380> cannon<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.329> drink

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
then you just fire your cannon and drink

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.140 
then you just fire your cannon and drink
your<00:03:33.480> extreme<00:03:33.870> set<00:03:34.250> pray<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.459> split<00:03:35.760> make<00:03:36.000> sure

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
your extreme set pray so split make sure

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.360 
your extreme set pray so split make sure
your<00:03:36.359> retaliate<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.959> on<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.500> course<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
your retaliate is on and of course you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.180 
your retaliate is on and of course you
can<00:03:38.669> momentum<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.569> but<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.680> momentum

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
can momentum here but if you do momentum

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.309 
can momentum here but if you do momentum
it<00:03:41.370> would<00:03:41.519> be<00:03:41.669> better<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.970> bring<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.569> unicorn<00:03:43.109> or

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
it would be better to bring a unicorn or

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.860 
it would be better to bring a unicorn or
a<00:03:43.380> yak<00:03:43.739> full<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.190> sharks<00:03:44.519> or<00:03:45.030> some<00:03:45.359> other<00:03:45.540> type

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
a yak full of sharks or some other type

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.599 
a yak full of sharks or some other type
of<00:03:45.900> type<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.500> healing<00:03:46.709> because<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.519> to

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
of type of healing because it's going to

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.490 
of type of healing because it's going to
be<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:47.910> hard<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.299> stay<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.750> full<00:03:48.989> health<00:03:49.319> if

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
be really hard to stay at full health if

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.920 
be really hard to stay at full health if
you<00:03:49.709> momentum<00:03:50.250> however<00:03:51.209> that's<00:03:51.450> always<00:03:51.690> an

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you momentum however that's always an

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.780 
you momentum however that's always an
option<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.620> afk<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> little<00:03:53.579> bit<00:03:53.700> as

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
option and you can afk a little bit as

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.270 
option and you can afk a little bit as
well<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.750> just<00:03:55.560> start<00:03:55.769> killing<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.069> blood

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
well and just start killing the blood

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.440 
well and just start killing the blood
votes<00:03:56.489> make<00:03:56.790> sure<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.090> look<00:03:57.299> out<00:03:57.389> for

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
votes make sure you look out for

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
votes make sure you look out for
effigies<00:03:58.049> but<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.799> drops

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
effigies but the drops

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.509 
effigies but the drops
besides<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.090> ancient<00:04:00.419> effigy<00:04:00.810> are<00:04:01.530> not<00:04:02.190> very

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
besides the ancient effigy are not very

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.699 
besides the ancient effigy are not very
good<00:04:02.609> they<00:04:03.060> leave<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.299> lot<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.750> be<00:04:03.870> desired<00:04:04.019> so

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
good they leave a lot to be desired so

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.800 
good they leave a lot to be desired so
don't<00:04:05.069> worry<00:04:05.250> about<00:04:05.400> checking<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.269> drops<00:04:06.540> too

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
don't worry about checking the drops too

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.960 
don't worry about checking the drops too
much<00:04:07.019> you're<00:04:07.889> not<00:04:07.919> going<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.519> miss<00:04:08.699> anything

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
much you're not going to miss anything

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.259 
much you're not going to miss anything
basically<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:11.220> task<00:04:11.459> does<00:04:11.879> not<00:04:12.060> take

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
basically but this task does not take

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.420 
basically but this task does not take
too<00:04:12.449> long<00:04:12.690> at<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.590> cannon<00:04:13.949> just<00:04:14.129> does

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
too long at all the cannon just does

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.759 
too long at all the cannon just does
work<00:04:14.730> hits<00:04:15.359> on<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.629> blood<00:04:15.840> valves<00:04:16.199> and<00:04:16.440> makes

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
work hits on the blood valves and makes

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.469 
work hits on the blood valves and makes
them<00:04:16.919> aggressive<00:04:17.370> T<00:04:17.519> which<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.030> best<00:04:18.209> part

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
them aggressive T which is the best part

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.849 
them aggressive T which is the best part
so<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.720> don't<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.109> run<00:04:19.289> around<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.680> room

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
so you don't have to run around the room

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.279 
so you don't have to run around the room
that<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.390> pretty<00:04:21.750> much<00:04:21.840> stand

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
that much you can just pretty much stand

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.420 
that much you can just pretty much stand
in<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.469> middle<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.860> blood<00:04:23.039> bills<00:04:23.250> will

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
in the middle and the blood bills will

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.100 
in the middle and the blood bills will
come<00:04:23.460> right

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
come right

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.860 
come right
so<00:04:24.740> anyway<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.699> is<00:04:25.759> how<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.060> do<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.509> blood

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so anyway this is how you do the blood

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.689 
so anyway this is how you do the blood
veld<00:04:27.080> task<00:04:27.319> in<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> evolution<00:04:28.099> of<00:04:28.129> combat<00:04:28.370> I

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
veld task in the evolution of combat I

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.850 
veld task in the evolution of combat I
just<00:04:28.939> figured<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.449> would<00:04:29.659> show<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.110> since<00:04:30.650> a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
just figured I would show this since a

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.920 
just figured I would show this since a
lot<00:04:31.099> of<00:04:31.189> people<00:04:31.490> don't<00:04:31.819> seem<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.389> know<00:04:32.689> about

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
lot of people don't seem to know about

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.350 
lot of people don't seem to know about
the<00:04:33.020> mutated<00:04:33.409> blood<00:04:33.620> veld<00:04:33.800> when<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.909> EOC

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
the mutated blood veld when the EOC

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.369 
the mutated blood veld when the EOC
first<00:04:35.659> came<00:04:35.930> out<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.889> these<00:04:37.280> were<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:38.840> weak

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:39.379 
first came out the these were not weak

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.140 
first came out the these were not weak
to<00:04:39.650> melee<00:04:39.979> at<00:04:40.159> all<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.699> was<00:04:40.759> a<00:04:40.849> very

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
to melee at all and it was a very

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.809 
to melee at all and it was a very
difficult<00:04:41.389> task<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:42.110> do<00:04:42.349> in<00:04:42.590> very<00:04:42.889> terrible<00:04:43.340> XP

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
difficult task to do in very terrible XP

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.300 
difficult task to do in very terrible XP
however<00:04:44.270> they<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.719> since<00:04:44.990> been<00:04:45.289> fixed<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.919> few

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
however they have since been fixed a few
