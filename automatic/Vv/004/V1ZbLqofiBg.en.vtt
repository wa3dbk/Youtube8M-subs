00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.719
 why the left because look so 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.609
 we go through there you go up on 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.620
 this platform and well at the very top 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.299

 climb on the roof recover the knife 

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:57.579
 of hunting the hunting knife how much 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.229
 it costs that it costs 3000 points for 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.619
 get it once you're going to be 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.239
 on the roof guys especially put you 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.800
 at the place where it rained space really 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.820
 more spaces like here there you go 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 have this famous hunting knife 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.340
 it will take up this past denied 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.930
 to have the sleeve of the clowns 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.580
 let's go it's gone you see with 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.710
 this method I just had the end 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.810
 I had a fair peace just before 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 crash of notes I already have the double 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.320
 tap and the leather file and there I try 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 to have a new asset always of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.560
 this way 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.600
 the sleeve of the clowns of the pools especially 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.909
 important the buddies never kill the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.080
 nails with the submachine gun with a 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.600
 other weapon than two hunting knives 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.520
 or possibly tip shot 0 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.990
 these are the only two weapons that 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.240
 will allow you to get a drink 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.560
 Free 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.450
 little trick the little technique 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.580
 rather of the technical type it is that it 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 must all the time stay mobile 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.650
 never stay still otherwise saplings 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.360
 where good calves and but in fact of you 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.310
 block in a corner what are they 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.940
 therefore expect to avoid staying in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.800
 corners always stay morizur there I 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.390
 just got the ammo max that's 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.610
 well there we are not blind wesh cousin 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 I doubt I know well but look 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.760
 what's going on I just got the from 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 makes the new drink new 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.720
 bonus 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.230
 and yes it's a new asset that comes 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.150
 to add 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.280
 so I'm gonna have to actually look 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.080
 well at the bottom left of the screen 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.040
 the quick reload then of this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.690
 way you will be able 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.910
 and yes as in ascension at no 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.209
 subsidize the famous cosmic monkey 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.980
 which was very annoying but 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.480
 that in the end if we managed to protect 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.280
 drinks we could get 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 many strengths well it's the same 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 you can get more than 4 to all 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.260
 so if you are brave of course and 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.100
 if you have the strength what is 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.650
 imperative also the buddies is that 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.599
 maybe maybe regime has maybe 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.189
 once you've got all the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.780
 assets like this way maybe 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.400
 you can possibly have the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.049
 looting developers who is well hidden 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.920
 in this map 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.450
 that's all for me for this 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.220
 video I'll see you soon see you 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.810
 well and especially the friends of massacre of 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.810
 zombie thirds boban for stake
