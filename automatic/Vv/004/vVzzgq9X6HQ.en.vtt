have<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.090> cut<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.450> know<00:01:44.600> picture<00:01:45.020> myself

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
have to cut it you know picture myself

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.410 
have to cut it you know picture myself
in<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.560> rubber<00:01:45.710> mask<00:01:45.980> so<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.150> fun<00:01:47.390> to

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
in the rubber mask so it's just fun to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.510 
in the rubber mask so it's just fun to
do<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.680> what<00:01:49.160> one<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
do and it's you know what one of the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.370 
do and it's you know what one of the
things<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.300> was<00:01:50.510> brought<00:01:50.540> up<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> panel

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380

to make sure that when you're doing a
large<00:01:56.750> amount<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.380> characters<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
large amount of characters in the in the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.130 
large amount of characters in the in the
dialogue<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.570> have<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.900> certain

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
dialogue that you have to have certain

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.900 
dialogue that you have to have certain
voices<00:02:00.440> in<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> room<00:02:00.860> how<00:02:01.010> do<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.520> make<00:02:01.730> sure

voices in the room how do you make sure

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.240 
voices in the room how do you make sure
you<00:02:02.030> get<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.270> balance<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:03.010> lot<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.130> that

sure that you know none of the voices

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.290 
sure that you know none of the voices
are<00:02:10.040> sounding<00:02:10.310> too<00:02:10.429> similar<00:02:10.790> especially<00:02:11.000> in

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
are sounding too similar especially in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.010 
are sounding too similar especially in
conversation<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:13.460> there's<00:02:13.640> like<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.600> went<00:02:14.930> to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
conversation and there's like I went to

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.650 
conversation and there's like I went to
this<00:02:15.140> acting<00:02:15.560> school<00:02:15.860> where<00:02:16.070> they<00:02:16.660> talked

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
this acting school where they talked

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.390 
this acting school where they talked
about<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> different<00:02:18.260> resonators<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:19.250> your

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
about the different resonators like your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.330 
about the different resonators like your
chest<00:02:19.880> voice<00:02:20.090> your<00:02:20.600> head<00:02:20.870> voice<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
chest voice your head voice your the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880 
chest voice your head voice your the
mask<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.020> lot<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.170> times<00:02:24.380> I'll<00:02:24.620> try<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
mask and so a lot of times I'll try to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890 
mask and so a lot of times I'll try to
make<00:02:25.070> sure<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.240> see<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.510> certain

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
make sure that if I see that certain

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.330 
make sure that if I see that certain
characters<00:02:27.170> are<00:02:27.470> going<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.710> be<00:02:27.770> interacting<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
characters are going to be interacting a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.220 
characters are going to be interacting a
lot<00:02:28.520> with<00:02:28.700> each<00:02:28.730> other<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.270> try<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.840> make<00:02:30.050> sure

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
lot with each other I try to make sure

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.300 
lot with each other I try to make sure
that<00:02:30.350> I'm<00:02:30.440> placing<00:02:30.680> them<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.160> different

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
that I'm placing them in different

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.700 
that I'm placing them in different
resonators<00:02:32.060> or<00:02:32.360> giving<00:02:33.080> them<00:02:33.200> enough<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.560> a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
resonators or giving them enough of a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.230 
resonators or giving them enough of a
distinction<00:02:34.370> whether<00:02:34.790> it's<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.210> know

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
distinction whether it's you know

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.900 
distinction whether it's you know
accents<00:02:36.080> or<00:02:36.200> vocal<00:02:36.440> qualities<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.340> whether

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
accents or vocal qualities that whether

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.250 
accents or vocal qualities that whether
you<00:02:38.090> all<00:02:38.240> come<00:02:38.480> together<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.140> that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you all come together for that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.570 
you all come together for that
exposition<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.070> not<00:02:40.220> going<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.460> be

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
exposition it's not going to be

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.690 
exposition it's not going to be
confusing<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.390> who<00:02:42.020> same<00:02:42.260> one<00:02:42.530> okay<00:02:43.489> that's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
cartoons and I made a series before you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.229 
cartoons and I made a series before you
came<00:02:55.730> into<00:02:56.920> audio<00:02:57.920> books<00:02:58.220> how<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.150> that

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
came into audio books how is that

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.880 
came into audio books how is that
different<00:02:59.420> what<00:02:59.780> how<00:02:59.989> did<00:03:00.050> would<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.230> compare

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
different what how did would you compare

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.610 
different what how did would you compare
them<00:03:01.390> well<00:03:02.410> with<00:03:03.410> animation<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.410> do<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
them well with animation I get to do the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.370 
them well with animation I get to do the
different<00:03:06.950> voices<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.510> just<00:03:08.840> record<00:03:09.290> that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
different voices and I just record that

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.590 
different voices and I just record that
voice<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.670> can<00:03:10.730> kind<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.180> put<00:03:11.360> everything

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
voice and I can kind of put everything

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.870 
voice and I can kind of put everything
into<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.959> character<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.580> audio

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
into that character and with the audio

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.620 
into that character and with the audio
books<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:15.440> to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
books I have to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.480 
books I have to
obviously<00:03:17.380> has<00:03:17.470> many<00:03:17.620> more<00:03:17.800> characters<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
obviously has many more characters and

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.430 
obviously has many more characters and
they're<00:03:18.580> talking<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.030> each<00:03:19.180> other<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.320> there's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
they're talking to each other so there's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.490 
they're talking to each other so there's
it's<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.910> more<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.500> concentration

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
it's just a it's more of a concentration

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's just a it's more of a concentration
thing<00:03:23.860> or<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> rhythm<00:03:24.370> thing<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.700> know<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
