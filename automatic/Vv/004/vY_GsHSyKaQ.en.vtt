00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.860 

all<00:00:01.050> right<00:00:01.199> if<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.760> starts<00:00:02.760> drawing<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.689> little

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
all right if I starts drawing a little

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.550 
all right if I starts drawing a little
simple<00:00:04.170> sketch<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.770> front<00:00:05.009> trim<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:06.560> you

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
simple sketch of the front trim and you

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.540 
simple sketch of the front trim and you
use<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.400> as<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> base<00:00:09.630> do<00:00:10.040> you<00:00:11.040> know<00:00:11.130> figure

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
use this as a base do you know figure

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.120 
use this as a base do you know figure
out<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> size<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> shape<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:13.559> all<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.889> crud

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
out the size and shape and all that crud

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.900 
out the size and shape and all that crud
but<00:00:15.830> I'll<00:00:16.830> probably<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.460> finish<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
but I'll probably have to finish the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
but I'll probably have to finish the
barrel<00:00:18.240> or<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:18.630> least<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.900> chamber<00:00:19.350> portion<00:00:19.770> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
barrel or at least a chamber portion of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.490 
barrel or at least a chamber portion of
the<00:00:20.010> barrel<00:00:20.250> first<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:21.449> I'll<00:00:21.779> probably<00:00:22.140> end<00:00:22.380> up

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the barrel first as I'll probably end up

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
the barrel first as I'll probably end up
making<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.859> cylinder<00:00:23.220> over<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.840> add

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
making a cylinder over it and just add

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
making a cylinder over it and just add
more<00:00:25.140> layers<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:27.109> maybe<00:00:28.699> square<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.849> off

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
more layers and then maybe square it off

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
more layers and then maybe square it off
once<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.810> enough<00:00:31.260> layers<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.920> have

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
once I get off enough layers so you have

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.850 
once I get off enough layers so you have
like<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.950> big<00:00:34.950> cylinder<00:00:36.380> it's<00:00:37.380> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> small

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
like a a big cylinder it's kind of small

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
like a a big cylinder it's kind of small
but<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> point<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but you get the point but you just you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
but you get the point but you just you
know<00:00:39.870> chunk<00:00:40.410> off<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> sides<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.309> I'll

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
know chunk off the sides and then I'll

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
know chunk off the sides and then I'll
just<00:00:44.579> keep<00:00:44.730> adding<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.149> layers<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just keep adding more layers on the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.709 
just keep adding more layers on the
sides<00:00:46.460> I'm<00:00:47.460> both<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> top<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> bottom<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sides I'm both on the top and bottom to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.330 
sides I'm both on the top and bottom to
get<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.200> dimension<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.100> you'll

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
get the right dimension you know you'll

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
get the right dimension you know you'll
have<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> walking's<00:00:51.239> portions<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.170> all

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
have all the walking's portions and all

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.750 
have all the walking's portions and all
that<00:00:52.440> stuff<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> course<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that stuff me and of course you have to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
that stuff me and of course you have to
drill<00:00:57.000> holes<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> such<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.859> yeah

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
drill holes and such like that yeah

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
drill holes and such like that yeah
that's<00:00:59.039> probably<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.550> I'll<00:01:00.510> probably<00:01:00.750> make

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's probably how I'll probably make

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920 
that's probably how I'll probably make
the<00:01:01.109> turnings<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:03.149> far<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> receiver

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the turnings and as far as the receiver

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.850 
the turnings and as far as the receiver
rows<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.580> let<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> sit<00:01:05.880> under<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.180> wait

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
rows I let it sit under those wait

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.320 
rows I let it sit under those wait
overnight

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
overnight

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
overnight
do<00:01:09.330> let<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> dry<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:12.080> also<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.260> have

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
do let it dry and also you know have

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
do let it dry and also you know have
this<00:01:13.650> cardboard<00:01:14.100> base<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.869> not<00:01:15.869> sure<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
this cardboard base and not sure if I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.219 
this cardboard base and not sure if I
mentioned<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.220> helps<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.600> keep<00:01:18.840> its<00:01:19.110> shape

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
mentioned but it helps it keep its shape

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.730 
mentioned but it helps it keep its shape
and<00:01:19.650> also<00:01:20.869> prevents<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.080> curving<00:01:24.740> either

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and also prevents it from curving either

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.090 
and also prevents it from curving either
direction<00:01:26.210> since<00:01:27.210> uh<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.799> tends<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
direction since uh it kind of tends to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
direction since uh it kind of tends to
contract<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> paper<00:01:33.990> has

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
contract a little bit so as a paper has

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.130 
contract a little bit so as a paper has
a<00:01:34.290> tendency<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.060> contract<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.240> curl<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a tendency to contract and curl in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.190 
a tendency to contract and curl in the
direction<00:01:37.229> where<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> fibre<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.549> running<00:01:39.200> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
direction where to fibre is running so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
direction where to fibre is running so
you'll<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.979> bit<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.310> curve<00:01:41.610> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you'll get that little bit of a curve so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
you'll get that little bit of a curve so
that's<00:01:42.570> why<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> base<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that's why I have it I have the base and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.819 
that's why I have it I have the base and
had<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> sitting<00:01:44.909> under<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> weight<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> I'll

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
had it sitting under the weight so I'll

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.639 
had it sitting under the weight so I'll
keep<00:01:46.979> straight<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.270> also<00:01:48.390> put<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> wax<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
keep straight and also put a wax or to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.319 
keep straight and also put a wax or to
handle<00:01:50.280> wax<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> carboy<00:01:51.420> Seoul<00:01:51.740> station

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
handle wax on the carboy Seoul station

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.859 
handle wax on the carboy Seoul station
and<00:01:54.329> say<00:01:54.540> yeah

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and say yeah

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.080 
and say yeah
the<00:01:55.409> receivers<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:56.700> nice<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the receivers pretty much nice and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.069 
the receivers pretty much nice and
straight<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:58.610> also<00:01:59.610> already<00:01:59.909> super<00:02:00.630> glue<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
straight on also already super glue the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.930 
straight on also already super glue the
seams<00:02:01.290> together<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
seams together so it just

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.520 
seams together so it just
pretty<00:02:04.510> much<00:02:04.600> solid<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.380> be<00:02:07.380> I'll<00:02:08.380> be

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
pretty much solid as it can be I'll be

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.730 
pretty much solid as it can be I'll be
more<00:02:08.760> sturdy<00:02:09.760> as<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.630> put<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> trunnions<00:02:11.590> in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
more sturdy as I put the trunnions in

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.600 
more sturdy as I put the trunnions in
and<00:02:11.920> such<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.590> little<00:02:14.650> bit<00:02:14.890> more<00:02:15.070> minor

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and such so just a little bit more minor

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.520 
and such so just a little bit more minor
work<00:02:15.940> such<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.540> putting<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.990> invitations

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
work such as putting the invitations
