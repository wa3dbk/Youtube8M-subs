00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.290 

in<00:00:00.560> this<00:00:01.560> example<00:00:01.949> we're<00:00:02.250> gonna<00:00:02.370> take<00:00:02.700> five

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
in this example we're gonna take five

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.630 
in this example we're gonna take five
numbers<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.259> are<00:00:04.410> written<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.859> percent<00:00:05.580> form

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
numbers that are written in percent form

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.509 
numbers that are written in percent form
and<00:00:06.180> we're<00:00:06.600> gonna<00:00:06.690> turn<00:00:07.049> those<00:00:07.259> into<00:00:07.519> decimals

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
and we're gonna turn those into decimals

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.129 
and we're gonna turn those into decimals
and<00:00:08.960> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.759> easiest<00:00:11.759> pie<00:00:12.059> if<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.719> remember

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and this is easiest pie if you remember

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.799 
and this is easiest pie if you remember
how<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.389> when

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
how to do it and all we have to do when

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.880 
how to do it and all we have to do when
we<00:00:15.960> rewrite<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.949> number<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.960> we<00:00:18.960> rewrite<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
we rewrite a number as we rewrite a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
we rewrite a number as we rewrite a
percentage<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> decimal<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
percentage as a decimal all you do is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.790 
percentage as a decimal all you do is
just<00:00:22.980> replace<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.820> percent<00:00:24.269> sign<00:00:24.769> with<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
just replace the percent sign with a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410 
just replace the percent sign with a
think<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.460> putting<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.789> decimal<00:00:27.240> there

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
think about putting your decimal there

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.179 
think about putting your decimal there
but<00:00:27.689> oh<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> correct

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
but oh actually it's not in the correct

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.790 
but oh actually it's not in the correct
spot<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.939> always<00:00:30.210> move<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:30.869> places<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
spot we always move it two places to the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
spot we always move it two places to the
left<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.989> 26<00:00:33.989> percent<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.250> gonna<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
left so 26 percent I'm gonna put as the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.910 
left so 26 percent I'm gonna put as the
decimal<00:00:37.860> places<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.640> two<00:00:39.360> six<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.320> I'm

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
decimal places point two six and I'm

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
decimal places point two six and I'm
even<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> zero<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.270> front<00:00:42.629> so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
even just gonna put a zero in front so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.060 
even just gonna put a zero in front so
26<00:00:44.040> percent<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.700> zero<00:00:45.120> point<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:46.050> six<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
26 percent is zero point two six and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
26 percent is zero point two six and
again<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:48.570> why<00:00:48.899> we're<00:00:49.110> doing<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.590> we

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
again the reason why we're doing that we

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.130 
again the reason why we're doing that we
saw<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.120> could<00:00:51.239> write<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> percentage<00:00:52.079> as

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
saw that we could write a percentage as

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.650 
saw that we could write a percentage as
a<00:00:55.140> fraction<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.370> dividing<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.000> 100

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
a fraction by just dividing it by 100

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.080 
a fraction by just dividing it by 100
and<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> divide<00:00:58.590> something<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:59.129> 100<00:00:59.910> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and if you divide something by 100 you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
and if you divide something by 100 you
in<00:01:00.210> effect<00:01:00.329> move<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> decimal<00:01:01.530> place<00:01:01.680> two

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
in effect move the decimal place two

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.210 
in effect move the decimal place two
places<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> shortcut<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.070> all

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
places but as a shortcut that's all

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.480 
places but as a shortcut that's all
we're<00:01:05.400> doing<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> okay

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
we're doing so okay

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
we're doing so okay
125<00:01:08.490> percent<00:01:09.030> let's<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.540> rid<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> percent

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
125 percent let's get rid of the percent

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.060 
125 percent let's get rid of the percent
move<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> decimal<00:01:11.700> place<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:12.540> spots<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
move the decimal place two spots so it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
move the decimal place two spots so it
says<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:15.860> 1.25<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> 125<00:01:19.170> percent<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
says we would get 1.25 so 125 percent is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.020 
says we would get 1.25 so 125 percent is
equivalent<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.330> point<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:22.110> five<00:01:23.030> two

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
equivalent to one point two five two

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
equivalent to one point two five two
percent<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> feels<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> there's<00:01:25.979> only

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
percent well it feels like there's only

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
percent well it feels like there's only
one<00:01:26.820> place<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> move<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> let's<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:27.990> some

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
one place to move it let's put some

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.670 
one place to move it let's put some
zeros<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> front<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:31.290> rid<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
zeros in front so if we get rid of the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
zeros in front so if we get rid of the
percentage<00:01:32.189> move<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.970> two<00:01:33.329> places<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
percentage move it two places to the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.800 
percentage move it two places to the
left<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.950> our<00:01:35.070> decimal<00:01:35.250> sign<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
left put our decimal sign right there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.200 
left put our decimal sign right there
we<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:38.840> 0.02<00:01:43.610> fourteen<00:01:44.610> thirty<00:01:44.939> five

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we would have 0.02 fourteen thirty five

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.639 
we would have 0.02 fourteen thirty five
percent<00:01:46.970> 1435<00:01:47.970> same<00:01:48.810> thing<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.350> rid<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
percent 1435 same thing get rid of the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.179 
percent 1435 same thing get rid of the
percentage<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.030> move<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> two<00:01:51.540> places

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
percentage and move it two places

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
percentage and move it two places
that'll<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> 14<00:01:53.820> point<00:01:54.649> three<00:01:55.649> five<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.600> last

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that'll be 14 point three five and last

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.850 
that'll be 14 point three five and last
but<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.990> least<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.869> 0.34%<00:02:00.869> same

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but not least if we have 0.34% same

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.050 
but not least if we have 0.34% same
thing<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.219> still<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> move<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.909> two

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
thing we still have to move with two

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.899 
thing we still have to move with two
places<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> left<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> let's<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.850> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
places to the left so let's see if we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
places to the left so let's see if we
took<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> decimal<00:02:07.110> place<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.649> moved<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> two

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
took the decimal place and moved it two

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
took the decimal place and moved it two
places<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> left<00:02:09.289> we<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.649> have

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
places to the left we would now have

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
places to the left we would now have
zero<00:02:11.310> point

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
zero point

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.309 
zero point
let's<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.720> still<00:02:13.020> two<00:02:13.200> zero

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
let's see still two zero

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.899 
let's see still two zero
three<00:02:15.319> four<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.950> would<00:02:16.129> be<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.519> equivalent

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
three four that would be the equivalent

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.349 
three four that would be the equivalent
decimal<00:02:17.750> form
