has this established look of the white
field<00:00:59.080> we<00:00:59.350> wanted<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.710> continue<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.580> another

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
field we wanted to continue that another

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.880 
field we wanted to continue that another
thing<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.510> we<00:01:01.660> wanted<00:01:01.990> to<00:01:02.050> try<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.440> do<00:01:02.560> was

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
thing that we wanted to try and do was

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.070 
thing that we wanted to try and do was
expose<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.400> text<00:01:03.970> stream<00:01:04.150> material<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.049> that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
expose that text stream material so that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.139 
expose that text stream material so that
you<00:01:05.290> can<00:01:05.470> actually<00:01:05.590> see<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.070> weave<00:01:06.220> then<00:01:06.939> also

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
you can actually see the weave then also

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.050 
you can actually see the weave then also
by<00:01:07.899> using<00:01:08.280> transparent<00:01:09.280> decals<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.880> can

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
by using transparent decals you can

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.029 
by using transparent decals you can
actually<00:01:10.210> see<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.869> within<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.380> bowel<00:01:11.560> or<00:01:11.590> logo

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
actually see it within the bowel or logo

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.139 
actually see it within the bowel or logo
like<00:01:12.250> sixth<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:15.250> slap<00:01:15.549> shots<00:01:15.880> on

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
like sixth is but on like slap shots on

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.029 
like sixth is but on like slap shots on
the<00:01:16.270> wrist<00:01:16.479> shots<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.079> it's<00:01:17.829> more

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
the wrist shots and it's more

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.130 
the wrist shots and it's more
comfortable<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.700> think<00:01:18.999> and<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.600> mean<00:01:19.990> it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
comfortable I think and I mean it's

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.649 
comfortable I think and I mean it's
getting<00:01:20.409> better<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.939> players<00:01:22.149> I<00:01:22.329> mean<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
getting better on the players I mean the

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.660 
getting better on the players I mean the
stakes<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.990> going<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.350> better<00:01:24.130> environment

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
stakes is going to be better environment

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.179 
stakes is going to be better environment
x6<00:01:25.119> teaser<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.619> good<00:01:26.770> put<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.039> that

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
x6 teaser it's a good put on that

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.179 
x6 teaser it's a good put on that
probably<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.329> most<00:01:28.570> important<00:01:29.350> thing<00:01:29.590> when

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
probably the most important thing when

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.399 
probably the most important thing when
you're<00:01:30.340> talking<00:01:30.789> about<00:01:30.880> wait<00:01:31.600> it's<00:01:32.079> actually

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
you're talking about wait it's actually

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.139 
you're talking about wait it's actually
about<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:32.829> balance<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.579> stick<00:01:33.819> itself

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
about the balance of the stick itself

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.569 
about the balance of the stick itself
because<00:01:34.569> anybody<00:01:35.499> can<00:01:35.590> make<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:36.130> very

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
because anybody can make a very

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.039 
because anybody can make a very
lightweight<00:01:36.850> stick<00:01:37.359> there's<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:37.810> balance

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
lightweight stick there's a balance

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.480 
lightweight stick there's a balance
between<00:01:38.289> how<00:01:38.619> much<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.950> stick<00:01:39.130> actually

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
between how much is stick actually

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.609 
between how much is stick actually
passed<00:01:39.939> away<00:01:40.270> versus<00:01:40.840> what<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.259> can<00:01:41.409> possibly

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
passed away versus what it can possibly

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.550 
passed away versus what it can possibly
way<00:01:42.039> our<00:01:42.819> biggest<00:01:43.390> concern<00:01:43.929> when<00:01:44.380> we're

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
way our biggest concern when we're

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.020 
way our biggest concern when we're
developing<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:45.130> stick<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.429> making<00:01:45.729> sure<00:01:45.850> that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
developing a stick is making sure that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.940 
developing a stick is making sure that
the<00:01:46.149> balance<00:01:46.659> of<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.109> stick<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.469> right<00:01:47.740> I

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the balance of the stick is right I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.440 
the balance of the stick is right I
think<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> lot<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.579> players<00:01:48.819> as<00:01:49.179> soon<00:01:49.359> as

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
think that a lot of players as soon as

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.940 
think that a lot of players as soon as
they've<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.899> know<00:01:49.929> picked<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.590> stick<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
they've you know picked up the stick and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.649 
they've you know picked up the stick and
put<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.249> their<00:01:51.369> hands<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.850> right<00:01:52.420> away

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
put in their hands and right away

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.870 
put in their hands and right away
they're<00:01:52.869> just<00:01:53.049> like<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.770> know<00:01:53.859> I<00:01:53.889> can't<00:01:54.490> can't
