00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
defensive side and I'm going to jump

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.540 
defensive side and I'm going to jump
into<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.020> MBT<00:00:17.530> which<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.920> defenders<00:00:18.370> have

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
into the MBT which the defenders have

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.880 
into the MBT which the defenders have
access<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.210> instantly<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.200> second<00:00:20.530> you<00:00:20.590> spawn

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
access to instantly the second you spawn

access to instantly the second you spawn
in<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.250> bad<00:00:21.430> news<00:00:21.670> is<00:00:21.700> the<00:00:22.660> attackers<00:00:23.080> get<00:00:23.260> two

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
in the bad news is the attackers get two

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.590 
in the bad news is the attackers get two
tanks<00:00:24.400> but<00:00:24.700> there's<00:00:24.850> a<00:00:24.910> 30-second<00:00:25.540> delay

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
tanks but there's a 30-second delay

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.510 
tanks but there's a 30-second delay
before<00:00:25.930> they<00:00:26.230> get<00:00:26.380> into<00:00:26.560> them<00:00:26.860> so<00:00:27.280> it<00:00:27.370> allows

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
before they get into them so it allows

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.280 
before they get into them so it allows
you<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.730> get<00:00:27.820> somewhat<00:00:28.420> set<00:00:28.660> up<00:00:28.810> before<00:00:29.170> you

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
you to get somewhat set up before you

start the pillar there i can eat a shelf
he<00:01:14.830> gave<00:01:15.070> me<00:01:15.250> his<00:01:15.280> side<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:16.480> gonna<00:01:16.690> try<00:01:16.870> to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
my damage of the sable shell if I had to

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.560 
my damage of the sable shell if I had to
do<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.250> again<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.670> when<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.910> play<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.330> round

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
do this again and when I play this round

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.470 
do this again and when I play this round
again<00:01:22.870> i<00:01:23.080> will<00:01:23.380> definitely<00:01:23.890> run<00:01:24.040> 'he<00:01:24.480> simply

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
again i will definitely run 'he simply

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.120 
again i will definitely run 'he simply
because<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:25.990> does<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> ton<00:01:26.530> more<00:01:26.740> damage

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
because it does a ton more damage

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.100 
because it does a ton more damage
compared<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.670> sable<00:01:27.970> shell<00:01:28.180> on<00:01:28.390> heavy

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
bounce against two tanks that can really

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.370 
bounce against two tanks that can really
come<00:01:33.940> into<00:01:34.090> handy<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.660> noticed<00:01:35.020> as<00:01:35.140> i<00:01:35.290> was

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
could see there are ton of hiding spots

shoot through those containers they

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.420 
shoot through those containers they
can't<00:02:04.930> destroy<00:02:05.110> them<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:05.980> I'm<00:02:06.040> going<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.220> try

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430

because<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.700> piece<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.120> armor<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.959> only<00:02:44.260> as

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
because a piece of armor is only as

look<00:02:46.900> at<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.230> mini-map<00:02:47.650> by<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.190> em<00:02:48.370> count<00:02:48.610> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
look at the mini-map by this em count so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.510 
look at the mini-map by this em count so
they<00:02:49.480> collapsed<00:02:50.080> what<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.650> our<00:02:50.980> right<00:02:51.280> flank

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
they collapsed what is our right flank

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.490 
they collapsed what is our right flank
their<00:02:51.970> left<00:02:52.270> flank<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> area<00:02:53.320> I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
their left flank and this is the area I

primarily played in that aggressive
gameplay<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.220> an<00:02:57.400> absolute<00:02:58.120> nightmare

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so do not let them get established back

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.280 
so do not let them get established back
here<00:03:01.330> they<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.750> one<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.020> two<00:03:02.140> things
