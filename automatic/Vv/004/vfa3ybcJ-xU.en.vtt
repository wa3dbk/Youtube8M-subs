00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.919
 but 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.789
 welcome 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.109
 let us approach the subject of techniques 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.109
 passing through that of strategies 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 in which the techniques are inserted 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.759
 I'll show you now 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.800
 a figure 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 givi proposes the articulation of research strategies 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.460
 qualitative research 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.300
 managerial 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.200
 in reality a set of devaluation activities and practices 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.460
 who rent 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.640
 strategies, tools and operational procedures have a whole 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.380
 chemical engineering companies 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.660
 of a substantially logical and causal nature 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.800
 the most famous technique and the logical framework are at the bottom 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.640
 now the 4th type is the best known example but there are several tools 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.010
 always of this nature 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.470
 that move in this context I don't consider myself particularly interesting 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.410
 and then I slide immediately to the wider and more interesting basin of the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.000
 social research 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.310
 as you see the first heinous social research based on the experiment 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 and all the rest 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.900
 this is a fairly canonical subdivision because in the owner experiment 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.550
 vision 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.050
 of the world of research very particular and worries 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.410
 basically to answer the known problem called 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.840
 counterfactuals eng 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.170
 that means 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.870
 what would have happened 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.760
 evenings to do to program now I did another 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.700
 what would have happened in the absence 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.870
 of that program 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.149
 what exactly the effect 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.490
 of the program 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.710
 net 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.070
 of the intervening variables, if not unknown to me 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.189
 that the fratte intervened 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.609
 now the experiment is very well known practiced in many disciplines 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.529
 in many sectors 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:31.009
 also in evaluation some Italian arc authors claim that it is a 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.829
 Prince method 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.389
 in reality, even if his intellect is very interesting and stimulating 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.009
 feasibility and its real effectiveness 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.120
 lum has big ones 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.179
 de nittis 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:49.039
 and therefore 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.730
 much more often 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.140
 sex is used to approach and character search strategies that are not yours 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.609
 experience 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.799
 you believe that in the text I propose a 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.909
 2 smont we say so particular designed arcs in a particular way 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.129
 In short 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.689
 criterium with many non-standard standard critics 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:15.749
 let's start from the latter 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.189
 if standard non-standard is a term 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.769
 more correct more precise 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.909
 to indicate locks 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.699
 commonly in other contexts it is called quantitative qualitative 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.299
 or by using a proposal the alberto marradi matriciale not 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.549
 matrix 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.079
 special day 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.639
 it means 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.219
 techniques whose information and data flow into a data matrix 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.669
 the ancient good and matrix quantity 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:55.999
 here d use standard that ancient qualitative non-matrix help does not 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.269
 standard 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.219
 what a laugh a lot of criteria 15 refers to 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.549
 to a concept of this kind 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.640
 we can have a fully quantitative search strategy for 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.790
 example a so-qualitative howto questionnaire for example from signs of 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.619
 ugly fire 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.479
 this unique criterion 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.529
 but 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.490
 as many authors claim I associate myself with textiles 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.970
 I use qualitative hey quantitative computer research strategies 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.550
 chemicals integrated between them 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.650
 going really better results is the effectiveness of the research 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.219
 evaluative and this is called 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.469
 approach 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.519
 I wrote him multi criterion multiman everything 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:50.400
 someone uses the internet for burnout of triangulation 3 techniques i 

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.680
 Anglo-Saxon. help and also in Italian is often found 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.180
 mixer measures 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.229
 very well these methods of estimating mixed techniques 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.509
 here they are written in the figure which showed in the sudowoodo wardrobe 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.740
 multicriteria boutique club 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.479
 at this point 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.520
 we look out on the tits 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.699
 techniques that we will see in the next game and that place indistinctly 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.199
 to be 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.659
 part of various typical dishes
