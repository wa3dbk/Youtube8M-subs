00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.690 
spend it on GTA 5 online shortcodes but
i<00:03:22.230> guess<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.890> extra<00:03:23.220> microsoft

i guess if you do have extra microsoft

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.640 
i guess if you do have extra microsoft
points<00:03:23.940> go<00:03:24.329> ahead<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.780> spin<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.079> towards<00:03:25.470> this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
points go ahead and spin it towards this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.410 
points go ahead and spin it towards this
that<00:03:25.950> way<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.160> guys<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.340> earn<00:03:26.760> yourself<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
that way you guys can earn yourself a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.539 
that way you guys can earn yourself a
little<00:03:27.630> bit<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.900> cash<00:03:28.049> on<00:03:28.530> GTA<00:03:28.829> 5<00:03:29.010> wine<00:03:29.280> once

again<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.820> is<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> very<00:03:30.329> effective<00:03:30.450> way<00:03:30.780> but

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
again this is a very effective way but

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.840 
again this is a very effective way but
at<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> same<00:03:31.829> time<00:03:32.070> probably<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> most

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
at the same time probably not the most

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.449 
at the same time probably not the most
recommended<00:03:33.360> way<00:03:33.810> as<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.680> coming<00:03:35.070> from<00:03:35.220> me<00:03:35.430> but
