00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello very good everyone here in you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.680
 we are a new video of gta 5 and I am 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 a video a very very important video 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 because it is an informative video 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.700
 that has two parts the first one is that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 there's going to be a maintenance worth of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.730
 server 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.530
 online gta or 7 from June 7 to 11 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.480
 June, so those days 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.490
 and the description will be good but 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.190
 those days at certain hours I'm not going to 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.950
 say all because the server will be in 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.490
 maintenance that will mean this 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 maintenance I really do not know I think 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.660
 that nothing but to cover an error eta 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.030
 so that you throw him out and fix things 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 that go bad in gta online is worth but 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.220
 they can put new things, it's worth 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.050
 now comes the second part of the video 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.610
 so the server is good 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.379
 maintenance partner we can not play 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.800
 those hours that says in the description what 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.920
 you have and now we go with the base of this 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.140
 video that is tipster update and by 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 I do not invent it because it has come out 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 It's worth on the official page of the story 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 of xbox is worth it has filtered 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.390
 In addition to the code it has been filtered 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.670
 this image this image that you are 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.230
 watching there are great i'm online auto 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.900
 not a hipster update 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.780
 was this image in the history of the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.120
 xbox and after a few minutes they deleted it 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 bad but people like people seem 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.430
 that is there with the eye always on 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.190
 to see these things but but good has 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.960
 come out this on the page is worth little 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 they erased it but the people 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.260
 pillo took it from the code and such and here 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.690
 what do you have there is no esther one of 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.150
 they are hipster you already know what a 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.420
 hipster the great love the ipad the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.240
 gafapastas I do not know what then there will be 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 an update is supposed to be from this 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.440
 not according to this information and if it is not 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.540
 invented that I do not believe because I was already 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.640
 in the history of xbox and I do not think it's 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.250
 that has been there by chance and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.200
 I put hipster by chance so 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.910
 there may be an update and that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.520
 is related to maintenance 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.590
 that will have the gta server 5 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.260
 online to enter this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.069
 update 1.14 with this new 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.200
 new fashion of expert and others for gta 5 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.390
 it is true that the word has been 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.909
 named throughout history about 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.030
 all by trevor the word hipster was worth 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:35.079
 and quite hipster on the street and in the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.760
 saints and I do not know what this dlc would include 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.829
 because they have supposed us according to a forum 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.860
 I was reading the assumption some 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.200
 cars that could include vale but 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.390
 our is not this yes it's nothing 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.489
 sure those people assuming things but 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.220
 I find it interesting that they include 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.790
 these cars and that a hipster car 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.700
 the truth is that he is not sad or that 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.629
 it can be a jeep car but and have 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.400

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.840
 enter this update as the blade 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.879

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.370
