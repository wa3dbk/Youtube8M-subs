00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.959 
spring is just stretch it out and
remember<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.170> leave<00:02:06.320> your<00:02:06.469> gun<00:02:06.679> cocked<00:02:07.340> or

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
remember not to leave your gun cocked or

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.089 
remember not to leave your gun cocked or
also<00:02:08.149> will<00:02:08.479> undo<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.920> stretching<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.069> the

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
also will undo the stretching of the

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.530 
also will undo the stretching of the
spring<00:02:10.429> you'll<00:02:10.670> have<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.239> about<00:02:11.390> once

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
spring you'll have to do that about once

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.509 
spring you'll have to do that about once
every<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:13.870> five<00:02:14.870> times<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.440> use<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.739> so

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
every like five times so you use it so

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.670 
every like five times so you use it so
this<00:02:16.700> will<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> lot<00:02:17.239> easier<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:18.379> all<00:02:18.560> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
this will be a lot easier so all you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.820 
this will be a lot easier so all you
have<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.799> do<00:02:19.660> essentially<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:20.989> screwed

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
have to do essentially it's just screwed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.690 
have to do essentially it's just screwed
on<00:02:22.040> here

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
on here

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.680 
on here
you<00:02:23.480> keep<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.230> row<00:02:26.440> now<00:02:27.440> once<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:27.920> on

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you keep it on the row now once it's on

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.030 
you keep it on the row now once it's on
just<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.750> little<00:02:29.780> bit<00:02:30.079> it'll<00:02:30.290> probably<00:02:30.530> pop<00:02:30.829> him

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
just a little bit it'll probably pop him

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.830 
just a little bit it'll probably pop him
a<00:02:31.160> little<00:02:31.400> bit<00:02:31.459> more<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.299> what<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> want<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.690> do

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
a little bit more so what you want to do

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
a little bit more so what you want to do
