00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.309
 we are going to make a turkey together 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.779
 stuffed baked for Christmas then 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.670
 for that we need a good turkey 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.050
 sure and to carry out the farce 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.949
 we will need the ingredients 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.570
 following the offal of the turkey 90 g of 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.339
 currants that we have made 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.220
 to swell in a little cognac 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:30.109
 with warm water 500 g of meat 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.060
 minced so there you see with your 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.130
 mouth and we chose a little bit of 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.350
 ports and a few of your so there you 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.969
 will find the best pieces 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.270
 then we will need 5 centilitres of 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.210
 liquid cream 5 centilitres of port 3 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.980
 centilitres of cognac 1.9 and 3 slices 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 of bread that we have soaked in a little 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.820
 of milk for cooking turkey 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.429
 we will also need pepper 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.719
 salt and butter so let's start 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.699
 to realize our farce 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.649
 if you have already bought the songs h 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.100
 and it's perfect otherwise you chop them 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.899
 chopper 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 so we already have the plane crashed and 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.580
 we go then h and the offal of the turkey 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.009
 m 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.280
 so we have h and offal and we 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 let's add them to the minced meat 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.109
 now we will add the others 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.109
 ingredients raisins 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.930
 the whole egg 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 the soaked bread in the milk that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.000
 just go and know a little 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.200
 cream and alcohol 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.220
 and then the best is to mix everything 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.220
 by hand 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.319
 our farce is ready now 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.069
 are going to garnish the turkey simply to 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.069
 using a tablespoon 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.570
 so according to your desires you can 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 also decorate the stuffing 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.380
 animals that you like for example for 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.050
 a festive side you can add some 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.260
 truffle thief or why not a little 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.260
 foie gras 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.510
 we have furry turkey if you 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.640
 stay a little prank you can everything 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.500
 just cook and serve next 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.540
 turkey and then the last one 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 step is to sew the side that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.000
 was fake to prevent the stuffing from 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.000
 escapes during cooking 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.170
 so normally we use a needle 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.819
 to butcher if you simply 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.019
 a needle and sewing thread at the 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.389
 house it works too 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.469
 little trick so here is even if you 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.180
 are not good at sewing 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:57.040
 do not bother with cross-stitching 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.329
 at the neck at big point that it works it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.760
 just need both sides of the skin 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.749
 touch each other to prevent the prank 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.019
 escapes and this is our one to be 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:09.669
 all sewn is all clean now 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.000
 we just have to install it in the 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.000
 baking dish 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.000
 so we can put it directly in 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.370
 my life fries and so we go 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.060
 season it a bit for cooking salt 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.640
 pepper and butter especially not necessary 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.960
 that it dries 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.910
 so we spread out a generous piece of 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.670
 butter on poultry 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.570
 there is about 60 g of butter 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.300
 easily and actually it's going to serve us 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.490
 for cooking since so everything at 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.740
 long cooking we will water the 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.980
 turkey to prevent your meat 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.980
 dried 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.690
 he 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.700
 so we're dirty and wav 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.370
 and we add water 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.700
 we water the turkey and especially we put 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.140
 the water at the bottom the dripping pan so you have to 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.570
 that it completely covers the bottom 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.430
 of ales taken to ensure that the whole 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.160
 burns for cooking 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.470
 we just programmed the oven at 180 Â° 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.070
 and after that depending on the weight of 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.020
 your turkey 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.220
 it takes 30 minutes of cooking 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.710
 for 500 grams 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.630
 here we have a turkey weighing 3 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.460
 kg 200 so we started well for three 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.830
 half hours since his attention on 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.160
 do not forget to water just about 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.160
 the 20 minutes 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.710
 our india is now cooked it has 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.480
 watered all the way down the thigh have 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.780
 generously now we can 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.780
 cut 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.550
 and so to serve our little india 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.139
 tasting tips recover the 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.940
 cooking juices that have settled 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.010
 bottom of the grill pan you will make a 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.120
 delicious sauce with a little 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.120
 porto and rise to the butter 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.740
 and so you can serve a pieces 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.060
