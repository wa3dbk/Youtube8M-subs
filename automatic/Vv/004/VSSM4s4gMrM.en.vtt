00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
through the chaos altar through the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.950 
through the chaos altar through the
tunnel<00:00:10.940> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.090> also<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.540> go<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
tunnel you can also just go out in the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
tunnel you can also just go out in the
wilderness<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.950> level<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.670> nine<00:00:15.059> or

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
twelve or something like that and then

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.130 
twelve or something like that and then
go<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.609> chaos<00:00:18.000> alter<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> way<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.690> if<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
go the chaos alter that way but if you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
go the chaos alter that way but if you
have<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:19.590> lies<00:00:19.770> below<00:00:20.100> quest<00:00:20.580> done<00:00:20.850> then<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
have what lies below quest done then you

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
have what lies below quest done then you
can<00:00:21.750> access<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.820> convenient

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
can access this which is very convenient

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.269 
can access this which is very convenient
but<00:00:24.990> either<00:00:25.260> way<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.949> kind<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> pain<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.670> go

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
but either way it's kind of a pain to go

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.090 
but either way it's kind of a pain to go
to<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> chaos<00:00:30.179> altar<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.680> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to the chaos altar but you know it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.209 
to the chaos altar but you know it's
worth<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:36.270> training<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.219> but

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
worth it for training you know but

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
worth it for training you know but
unless<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> spend<00:00:39.719> your<00:00:39.899> money<00:00:40.170> on

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
unless you want to spend your money on

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.180 
unless you want to spend your money on
chaos<00:00:40.739> rooms<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:44.899> yep<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.710> through<00:00:46.890> here

chaos rooms but yep you go through here
and<00:00:47.480> basically<00:00:49.160> just<00:00:50.160> follow<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> path<00:00:51.480> out

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
and basically just follow the path out

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
and basically just follow the path out
and<00:00:53.390> then<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:58.020> you're<00:00:58.859> going

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to have to come up this way also once

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.509 
to have to come up this way also once
you're<00:01:01.469> done<00:01:01.620> crafting<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:04.519> i'll

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you're done crafting because i'll

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're done crafting because i'll
teleport<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> wilderness<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.680> if

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
teleport you to the wilderness if you if

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.260 
teleport you to the wilderness if you if
you<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.790> through<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> one

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you just if you just go through the one

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
you just if you just go through the one
of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> other<00:01:12.600> portals<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> go

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of the other portals so you have to go

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
of the other portals so you have to go
through<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.950> portal<00:01:14.340> only<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.360> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
through this portal only just just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.399 
through this portal only just just
saying<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> slider<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
saying and then you go to the slider and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.149 
saying and then you go to the slider and
it's<00:01:26.189> pretty<00:01:26.549> simple<00:01:26.850> compared<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.159> going

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's pretty simple compared to going

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.380 
it's pretty simple compared to going
through<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> wilderness<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.040> foal

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
through the wilderness way the the foal

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
through the wilderness way the the foal
way<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:36.259> yep<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.110> back<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:43.130> do

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
way but yep then you just go back up do

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
way but yep then you just go back up do
not<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.520> through<00:01:44.790> any<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.390> portals

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
not go through any of the other portals

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
not go through any of the other portals
because<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
because it will just take you to the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
because it will just take you to the
wilderness<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.380> you'll<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> go

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
wilderness and then you'll have to go

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.160 
wilderness and then you'll have to go
all<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.390> opening<00:01:54.869> point

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
all the way back to the opening point

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.060 
all the way back to the opening point
which<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.770> pain<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
which is a pain but if you have to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
which is a pain but if you have to
replay<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.640> video<00:01:59.969> many<00:02:00.240> times<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.840> memorize

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
replay this video many times to memorize

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
replay this video many times to memorize
it<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.890> okay<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:03.020> don't<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.200> mind<00:02:08.149> but

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it that's okay I don't really mind but

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.780 
it that's okay I don't really mind but
yeah<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.410> pretty<00:02:10.860> straightforward<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
yeah it's a pretty straightforward I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.449 
yeah it's a pretty straightforward I
mean<00:02:12.319> it'd<00:02:13.319> be<00:02:13.500> nice<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.980> could<00:02:14.099> go<00:02:14.250> from

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
mean it'd be nice if you could go from

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.610 
mean it'd be nice if you could go from
here<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.879> there<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> portal<00:02:16.319> from<00:02:16.440> there

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
here to there to the portal from there

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.100 
here to there to the portal from there
but<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.129> can't<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:19.200> ELC<00:02:20.360> nice<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.480> say<00:02:21.690> current

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
but you can't on ELC nice to say current

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.559 
but you can't on ELC nice to say current
or<00:02:22.260> inscape<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.800> think<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:24.300> I

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
or inscape I think you can because I

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.660 
or inscape I think you can because I
remember<00:02:24.900> runes<00:02:25.410> crafting<00:02:25.890> k<00:02:26.040> essence<00:02:26.459> there

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
remember runes crafting k essence there

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.839 
remember runes crafting k essence there
a<00:02:26.700> long<00:02:26.940> time<00:02:26.970> ago<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> couple<00:02:29.670> years

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
a long time ago and like a couple years

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.820 
a long time ago and like a couple years
ago<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.810> could<00:02:31.080> take<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.379> as<00:02:31.800> a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
ago and I think you could take that as a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.630 
ago and I think you could take that as a
shortcut<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.300> old<00:02:36.569> school<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:38.459> make

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
shortcut but not on old school and make

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.040 
shortcut but not on old school and make
it<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.819> bit<00:02:38.970> harder<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:40.560> course<00:02:41.810> because<00:02:42.810> what

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it a bit harder of course because what

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.460 
it a bit harder of course because what
is<00:02:43.170> old<00:02:43.349> school<00:02:43.530> without<00:02:43.830> hard<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.610> mean

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
is old school without hard I mean
