enough to represent USA two tournaments

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:36.780 
enough to represent USA two tournaments
back<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.250> 2011<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.940> played<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.479> London

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:57.990 

yet

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090 

we've<00:01:59.000> some<00:01:59.179> of<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.329> lads<00:01:59.509> playing<00:01:59.689> 15

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
we've some of the lads playing 15

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.050 
we've some of the lads playing 15
getting<00:02:01.100> used<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> sevens<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> bit

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
getting used to sevens is a bit

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.999 
getting used to sevens is a bit
different<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.229> think<00:02:03.530> we<00:02:03.649> come<00:02:03.829> out<00:02:03.979> a

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
different so I think we come out a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.190 
different so I think we come out a
second<00:02:04.490> half<00:02:04.640> guard<00:02:05.000> kickoff<00:02:05.420> sorted<00:02:05.869> guard

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
second half guard kickoff sorted guard

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.680 
second half guard kickoff sorted guard
offense<00:02:06.500> or<00:02:06.740> attack<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.209> come<00:02:08.599> out

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
offense or attack going and it come out

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.850 
offense or attack going and it come out
from<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.959> end<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.289> we<00:02:09.379> ended<00:02:09.590> up<00:02:09.709> winning

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
from the end and we ended up winning

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.990 
from the end and we ended up winning
about<00:02:10.039> quiet<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.459> pocket<00:02:10.789> amount

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
about quiet in the pocket amount

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
about quiet in the pocket amount
obviously<00:02:11.599> there's<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> lot<00:02:11.959> more<00:02:12.080> space<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.530> I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
obviously there's a lot more space but I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.500 
obviously there's a lot more space but I
think<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.920> need<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.069> lot<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.610> lot<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.150> difference

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
think you need a lot a lot of difference

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.630 
think you need a lot a lot of difference
in<00:02:14.660> player<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.430> obviously<00:02:16.430> with<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
in player and obviously with the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.850 
in player and obviously with the
forwards<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.120> need<00:02:17.299> some<00:02:17.540> lean<00:02:18.230> guys<00:02:18.500> that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
forwards you need some lean guys that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.559 
forwards you need some lean guys that
quick<00:02:19.129> as<00:02:19.310> well<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.700> well<00:02:19.849> as<00:02:19.970> strong<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.480> then

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
quick as well as well as strong and then

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.479 
quick as well as well as strong and then
in<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> backs<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.170> need<00:02:21.319> some<00:02:21.530> vaginal

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
in the backs you need some vaginal

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.069 
in the backs you need some vaginal
people<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.299> about<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> pitch<00:02:23.810> well

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
people that can get about the pitch well

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.380 
people that can get about the pitch well
but<00:02:24.430> fingers<00:02:25.430> well<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.819> lads<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.090> done<00:02:26.209> well

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
but fingers well the lads have done well
adapted<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> obviously<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.500> first<00:02:27.709> game<00:02:27.950> I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980

think everyone's a bit nervous and then

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.839 
think everyone's a bit nervous and then
