are<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.009> same<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.240> measure<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.020> room<00:01:44.320> and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
are the same so measure you room and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.280 
are the same so measure you room and
then<00:01:44.799> add<00:01:45.040> ten<00:01:45.549> percent<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.360> mistakes<00:01:46.900> and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
then add ten percent for mistakes and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.380 
then add ten percent for mistakes and
also<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.680> few<00:01:47.979> extra<00:01:48.100> boards<00:01:48.640> for<00:01:48.759> replacements

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
also a few extra boards for replacements

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.590 
also a few extra boards for replacements
over<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.320> floors<00:01:50.590> lifetime<00:01:51.369> don't<00:01:52.270> worry<00:01:52.420> too

this<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.250> cover<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.700> expansion<00:02:52.540> gap

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
this is to cover the expansion gap

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.320 
this is to cover the expansion gap
you'll<00:02:53.110> need<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> leave<00:02:53.590> all<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.070> way<00:02:54.190> around

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you'll need to leave all the way around

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.940 
you'll need to leave all the way around
because<00:02:55.330> wood<00:02:55.570> will<00:02:55.900> move<00:02:56.170> with<00:02:56.500> different

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
because wood will move with different

because wood will move with different
temperatures<00:02:57.460> as<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.970> expands<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.840> contracts

world a chance to acclimatize one of the
big<00:03:25.060> problems<00:03:25.300> with<00:03:25.720> laying<00:03:25.960> a<00:03:26.140> real<00:03:26.290> wood

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
big problems with laying a real wood

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.530 
big problems with laying a real wood
floor<00:03:26.740> is<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.580> does<00:03:27.730> expand<00:03:28.300> and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
floor is that it does expand and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.420 
floor is that it does expand and
contract<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.230> by<00:03:29.350> doing<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.830> laying<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
contract so by doing this laying the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.850 
contract so by doing this laying the
packs<00:03:30.670> flat<00:03:31.120> lean<00:03:31.660> them<00:03:31.840> in<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.110> room<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.560> have

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
packs flat lean them in the room I have

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.290 
packs flat lean them in the room I have
a<00:03:32.950> chance<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.460> settle<00:03:33.760> down<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.180> that's

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
a chance to really settle down so that's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.240 
a chance to really settle down so that's
a<00:03:34.360> really<00:03:34.570> important<00:03:35.020> point<00:03:37.500> okay<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.860> start

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
a really important point okay so start

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.000 
a really important point okay so start
the<00:03:39.430> job<00:03:39.640> with<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.390> wall<00:03:40.660> furthest<00:03:41.350> away<00:03:41.620> from

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
the job with the wall furthest away from

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.520 
the job with the wall furthest away from
the<00:03:42.550> door<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.330> general<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.870> better<00:03:44.170> to

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the door and in general it's better to

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.160 
the door and in general it's better to
lay<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:45.220> boards<00:03:45.610> lengthways<00:03:46.300> along<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.990> sort

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
lay the boards lengthways along the sort

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.080 
lay the boards lengthways along the sort
of<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.500> longest<00:03:47.860> part<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.310> room<00:03:48.520> rather

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
of the longest part of the room rather

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.450 
of the longest part of the room rather
than<00:03:49.300> sideways<00:03:50.290> across<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.890> room<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> looks

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
than sideways across the room it looks

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.460 
than sideways across the room it looks
better<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.760> way<00:03:51.910> as<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.900> can<00:03:52.990> see<00:03:53.230> we've

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
better that way as you can see we've

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.310 
better that way as you can see we've
started<00:03:53.800> by<00:03:54.400> laying<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.120> under<00:03:55.630> boards<00:03:56.140> or

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
started by laying the under boards or

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.450 
started by laying the under boards or
the<00:03:56.410> felt<00:03:56.650> balls<00:03:56.890> will<00:03:57.010> be<00:03:57.100> bought<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> other

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.110 
it yes just gonna remember to put it at
45<00:04:02.350> degrees<00:04:02.740> so<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.070> joints<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.730> underlay

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
45 degrees so the joints of the underlay

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.640 
45 degrees so the joints of the underlay
and<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.330> joints<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.690> timber<00:04:05.020> floor<00:04:05.290> don't

you can use them for in filling around
the<00:04:12.130> edges<00:04:12.600> okay<00:04:13.600> great<00:04:13.900> well<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.080> guess<00:04:14.320> are<00:04:14.560> we

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the edges okay great well I guess are we

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.349 
the edges okay great well I guess are we
in<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.770> point<00:04:14.950> where<00:04:15.130> we<00:04:15.190> can<00:04:15.340> start<00:04:15.820> laying<00:04:16.120> or

in a point where we can start laying or

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.240 
in a point where we can start laying or
do<00:04:16.450> we<00:04:16.540> do<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> rest<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.200> room<00:04:17.380> no<00:04:17.799> only<00:04:18.070> do

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
do we do the rest of the room no only do

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.229 
do we do the rest of the room no only do
half<00:04:18.460> because<00:04:18.700> you're<00:04:18.910> going<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> end<00:04:19.210> up

half because you're going to end up
tripping<00:04:19.600> over<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.900> bits<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.200> pieces<00:04:20.440> and

tripping over the bits and pieces and
dinging<00:04:20.799> indenting<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:21.670> just<00:04:21.970> do<00:04:22.090> half<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
dinging indenting it so just do half the
