00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.800
 one of the great benefits that they have 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.100
 these china tablets for as much as they are 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.720
 so popular in lately 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.070
 well they are all Chinese but in 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.990
 particular these that bring this cable 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.459
 hbo in this case protects allows 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.619
 connect any device or 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.619
 almost anyone like these adapters 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.850
 and interact with them from the tablet 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.740
 for example this particular a 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.580
 a table marks in quotation marks because a 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.360
 90 and therefore it is an article there will be 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.890
 close every 30 66 I will open a viewer 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.890
 what is connected usb 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.040
 First 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.040
 the first author 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.020
 this is the pl 23 03 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.570
 the Taiwanese company called prolific 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.510
 that copied a bit what the ft does and in 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.220
 the one that I keep came 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.120
 I'm going to try it arduino 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 the student like many other devices 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.480
 what they generated 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.830
 for all current would be as in f 7 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.830
 2 3 2 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.960
 and enter a little more popular than the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.100
 prolific though the cheapest policy 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.500
 with the version that I have at this moment 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.180
 have some problems with the 8's 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.130
 now I'm going to occupy the computer today of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.740
 a similar arduino and de facto environment 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.399
 is to your program about the same thing I'm going to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.940
 upload a writing example here by 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.820
 the serial port 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 stable has command the four shifts and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.230
 put around 200 dollars a little 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.230
 more plays a pillar the example 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.299
 I will not go up in a moment 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.100
 this room is surrounded 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.349
 the model that has 128 even if it's not the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.959
 same plate on the plate of a similar 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.700
 but it came up perfect for a monitor 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.700
 serial to see what I command 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.830
 good as they said I connect 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.830
 receipt 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 what 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:39.460
 fotea because it is the live one in which there is 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.320
 that provide the utility from 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.320
 to do what I leave 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.570
 and good and now I'm going for the last time 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.850
 we work and realize that this 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.180
 greatly increased the capabilities of the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180
 tablet
