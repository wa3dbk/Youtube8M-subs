this<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.180> stitching<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.390> folding<00:00:06.870> machine

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this is stitching and folding machine

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.360 
this is stitching and folding machine
this<00:00:08.280> pattern<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.179> thought<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.860> had<00:00:11.130> this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
this pattern is thought so we had this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.959 
this pattern is thought so we had this
machine<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:13.400> function<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.730> use

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
machine have a a to function in one use

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.840 
machine have a a to function in one use
manual<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.590> other<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.949> automatically

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
manual and the other is automatically

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.179 
manual and the other is automatically
for<00:00:18.150> folding<00:00:18.539> or<00:00:18.690> binding<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
for folding or binding and this is a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.310 
for folding or binding and this is a
site<00:00:21.109> okay

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
site okay

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.599 
site okay
setter<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:24.019> change<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.320> automatic<00:00:26.099> O'War

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
setter to change to automatic O'War

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
setter to change to automatic O'War
manual<00:00:28.460> many<00:00:29.460> okay<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.109> part<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
manual many okay so this part is to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.010 
manual many okay so this part is to
start<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> speed<00:00:34.640> second<00:00:36.020> is

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
start so kind of the speed second is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.580 
start so kind of the speed second is
from<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.890> second<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> nine<00:00:39.899> second<00:00:42.590> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
from one second to up to nine second one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.330 
from one second to up to nine second one
till<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.640> set<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.660> second<00:00:46.230> confirm<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
till we set to second confirm this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
till we set to second confirm this
button<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.309> now<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.510> we<00:00:51.510> started<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.649> put

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
button so we now we we started to put

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.990 
button so we now we we started to put
the<00:00:53.750> stepper<00:00:54.750> here

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.149 

long<00:01:00.000> race

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:39.050 

slow<00:01:12.159> tightly<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.310> other<00:01:15.490> one<00:01:18.240> screw<00:01:19.240> out

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.600

now is that of this side to the the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.140 
now is that of this side to the the
paper<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> full<00:02:53.379> paper<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:54.250> fold<00:02:54.640> half

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
paper this is a full paper to fold half

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.069 
paper this is a full paper to fold half
fold<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.959> bunny<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:56.799> we<00:02:56.950> sit<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> be

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
fold and bunny so we sit here go to be

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.690 
fold and bunny so we sit here go to be
measure<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.680> paper<00:03:01.859> after<00:03:02.859> putting<00:03:03.160> hard

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
measure this paper after putting hard

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.550 
measure this paper after putting hard
folding<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.870> measure<00:03:05.430> size<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:08.459> 147

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
folding is the measure size is the 147

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:20.399 
folding is the measure size is the 147
okay<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:13.420> here<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:14.829> needed<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:20.109> is

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
okay we see here we needed to this is

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.839 
okay we see here we needed to this is
this<00:03:20.590> button<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.250> fixed<00:03:21.970> fix<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.840> condition

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
this button is fixed fix the condition

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.089 
this button is fixed fix the condition
so<00:03:24.849> we<00:03:25.030> can<00:03:25.209> move<00:03:25.420> with<00:03:25.659> this<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:26.049> portal<00:03:26.799> is

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
so we can move with this a portal is

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.020 
so we can move with this a portal is
very<00:03:27.519> easily<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.950> see<00:03:30.340> sit<00:03:31.299> for<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.690> paper

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
very easily to see sit for this paper

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.900 
very easily to see sit for this paper
147<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:35.230> here<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.790> we<00:03:37.000> exploded<00:03:37.959> scattering

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
147 so here so we exploded scattering

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.809 
147 so here so we exploded scattering
pixel<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> position<00:03:40.780> okay<00:03:44.639> see<00:03:45.639> this<00:03:45.700> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
pixel in this position okay see this is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.960 
pixel in this position okay see this is
each<00:03:46.060> insurance<00:03:46.560> cover<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.129> close<00:03:48.790> this

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
each insurance cover so we close this

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.500 
each insurance cover so we close this
car<00:03:49.299> oh<00:03:49.329> this<00:03:50.139> will<00:03:50.379> be<00:03:50.590> work<00:03:50.829> after<00:03:51.579> open<00:03:52.329> this

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
car oh this will be work after open this

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.339 
car oh this will be work after open this
cover<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.230> system<00:03:53.709> oh<00:03:53.799> she's<00:03:53.980> not<00:03:54.280> work<00:03:54.639> okay

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
cover is system oh she's not work okay

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.599 
cover is system oh she's not work okay
we<00:03:56.349> close<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:56.949> cover<00:03:58.260> and<00:04:00.599> now<00:04:01.599> we<00:04:02.109> start

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
we close this cover and now we start

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.970 
we close this cover and now we start
this<00:04:03.609> is<00:04:03.669> Batman<00:04:04.359> you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.740 

that<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.460> is<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.810> banding<00:04:11.820> that's<00:04:12.820> what<00:04:13.120> go

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
that is is is banding that's what go

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:43.150 
that is is is banding that's what go
back<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:14.200> us<00:04:15.329> so<00:04:16.329> we<00:04:16.570> check<00:04:16.870> again

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.670 

so<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.220> can<00:04:44.490> see<00:04:44.700> here<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.680> absolutely

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
so you can see here is a absolutely
