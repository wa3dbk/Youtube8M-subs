you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> seems<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.600> I've<00:01:09.840> been<00:01:10.020> doing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you know it seems like I've been doing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
you know it seems like I've been doing
it<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.500> less<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:11.130> presumably<00:01:11.610> seems<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it for less it presumably seems to the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
it for less it presumably seems to the
outside<00:01:13.020> observer<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.040> I've<00:01:14.220> been<00:01:14.310> doing<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
outside observer like I've been doing it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
outside observer like I've been doing it
for<00:01:14.700> less<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> person<00:01:15.750> has<00:01:15.840> been

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
for less but as the person has been

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
for less but as the person has been
doing<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> also<00:01:16.920> seems<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
doing it also seems like it's going to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
doing it also seems like it's going to
look<00:01:17.850> cookout<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.869> 17<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> quite<00:01:19.680> early

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
look cookout I think 17 is quite early

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
look cookout I think 17 is quite early
and<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> precocious<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.170> lost<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.890> lot<00:01:23.009> of
