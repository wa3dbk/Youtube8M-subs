like we're going to do today alright so
first<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.450> we're<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.900> set<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

first thing we're going to do is set the
camera<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.010> recommend<00:01:08.909> setting<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
camera now I recommend setting the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
camera now I recommend setting the
shutter<00:01:09.450> speed<00:01:09.750> around<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.080> fifth<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> second

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
shutter speed around a fifth of a second

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
shutter speed around a fifth of a second
to<00:01:11.159> start<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.840> far<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> aperture

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to start and then as far as the aperture

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
to start and then as far as the aperture
that<00:01:13.799> could<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.040> anywhere<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that could be anywhere like in the you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
that could be anywhere like in the you
know<00:01:15.960> 2.82<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.920> range<00:01:17.130> somewhere<00:01:17.460> around

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
know 2.82 for range somewhere around

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.640 
know 2.82 for range somewhere around
there<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.540> big<00:01:18.720> determining<00:01:19.170> factor<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.500> all

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there the big determining factor in all

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.609 
there the big determining factor in all
this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.159> ISO<00:01:20.689> if<00:01:21.689> its<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.080> bright<00:01:22.320> window

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this is your ISO if its a bright window

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.740 
this is your ISO if its a bright window
light<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.280> I'll<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:24.060> use<00:01:24.240> ISO

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
light like this I'll probably use ISO

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
light like this I'll probably use ISO
around<00:01:25.049> 100<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.490> later<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
around 100 but if it's later in the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
around 100 but if it's later in the
evening<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
evening and you can do this you know the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
evening and you can do this you know the
shoot<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.799> night<00:01:28.979> i<00:01:29.420> recommend<00:01:30.420> probably

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
shoot at night i recommend probably

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.539 
shoot at night i recommend probably
somewhere<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> 800<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.950> range<00:01:32.250> for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
somewhere in the 800 and up range for
