00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.580
 Welcome to videoblog formalist 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.260
 we often see on a JCE 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.720
 effective product to treat the contour 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.790
 of the eye that is what makes the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.210
 area around the eyes of the rest of the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.230
 rest of the face is an area apoco 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.970
 vascularized with very little irrigation 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.670
 blood drainage is more 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.500
 complicated for that reason and there is a 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.559
 tendency that accumulates in toxins and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.540
 pigments if toxins accumulate and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.820
 pigments we get these dark rings under 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.830
 and in anything for the lack of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.030
 drainage and fluid accumulation goes 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.890
 to appear bags is an area besides that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.949
 where the epithelium is very thin and very 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.720
 fragile has very little muscle support and 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.850
 very little fatty tissue that I would give 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.500
 filling that is why it is necessary to treat it 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.049
 with a product like the eye contour 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.320
 from laboratories fridda dorsch we like 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:04.089
 in a special way because on the one hand 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.840
 reduces the bags its popular in addition 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.240
 eliminates severe dark circles 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.829
 has a firming action on the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 eyelid skin that also does not have to be 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.280
 neglect it since the eyelid 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.740
 We use constantly to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.369
 gesticulate and the epithelium is equally 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.109
 fine and hypoallergenic plus a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.299
 advantage that we have fallen in love with 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.929
 list is that it comes in a container 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 smart not get oxygen to 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.469
 do not enter the light and by not inserting the finger 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.219
 the product has not is not necessary 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.989
 formulate it with preservatives 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.329
 antibacterial antioxidants with what 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:44.489
 which by eliminating antioxidants and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.530
 all the rest of preservatives everything 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:48.750
 what we get produces a benefit 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.759
 direct on our skin I encourage you to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.739
 that you try an eye contour with 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
 high concentrations of principles 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.939
 assets of great purity and quality we 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.939
 see you soon in the next video
