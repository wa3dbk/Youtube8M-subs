00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
video for updating to ten points from

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.179 
video for updating to ten points from
way<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.910> online<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> PC<00:00:07.410> or<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> virtual

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
way to online on a PC or in a virtual

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.839 
way to online on a PC or in a virtual
machine<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.860> basically<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.219> lot<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.519> people

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
machine and basically a lot of people

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.339 
machine and basically a lot of people
after<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.179> video<00:00:12.420> mentioned<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.139> there

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
after that video mentioned that there

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.390 
after that video mentioned that there
was<00:00:13.530> some<00:00:13.860> luck<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.580> mouse<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.340> I<00:00:17.340> know

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
was some luck on the mouse and I know

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.490 
was some luck on the mouse and I know
this<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.820> well<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.300> I've<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:18.990> found<00:00:19.289> out

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
this as well and I've actually found out

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.070 
this as well and I've actually found out
that<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.090> down<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.330> case<00:00:21.539> right<00:00:21.779> here

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that it's down to this case right here

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.700 
that it's down to this case right here
IOH<00:00:22.590> ID<00:00:22.800> family<00:00:23.220> text<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.410> video<00:00:25.619> is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
IOH ID family text and so this video is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
IOH ID family text and so this video is
going<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> show<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.220> fix<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.880> problem

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
going to show you how to fix the problem

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.320 
going to show you how to fix the problem
and<00:00:28.519> basically<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
and basically to do it all you have to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
and basically to do it all you have to
do<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.510> replace<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.439> text<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.040> ten<00:00:32.250> points<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
do is replace the text in ten points I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
do is replace the text in ten points I
point<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.450> ten<00:00:33.660> points<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
point to with the one in ten points and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.160 
point to with the one in ten points and
put<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.649> ten<00:00:34.980> point<00:00:35.160> seven<00:00:35.280> point<00:00:35.790> zero<00:00:36.170> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
put one of ten point seven point zero so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
put one of ten point seven point zero so
if<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> already<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.460> as

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
if you already know how to do that as

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.670 
if you already know how to do that as
some<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.600> probably<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.230> ahead<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.559> do

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
some of you probably do go ahead and do

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.619 
some of you probably do go ahead and do
it<00:00:40.850> I'm<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> run<00:00:42.270> through<00:00:42.450> real

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it I'm just going to run through real

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.670 
it I'm just going to run through real
quickly<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.050> those<00:00:43.230> people<00:00:43.469> who've<00:00:43.559> done

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
quickly for those people who've done

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
quickly for those people who've done
that<00:00:43.890> how<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> make<00:00:46.620> sure<00:00:46.649> you

that how to so you want to make sure you
have<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.430> text<00:00:47.760> 110<00:00:48.059> points<00:00:48.180> number<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.539> are

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
have the text 110 points number one are

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.260 
have the text 110 points number one are
ten<00:00:48.840> point<00:00:49.020> seven<00:00:49.170> point<00:00:49.530> zero<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> grab

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
ten point seven point zero you can grab

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
ten point seven point zero you can grab
this<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.440> finding<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:54.270> system

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this just by finding it from system

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
this just by finding it from system
library<00:00:55.140> extensions<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.129> copying

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
library extensions and you know copying

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
library extensions and you know copying
it<00:00:56.640> across<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> yeah<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> then

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it across so yeah go to go and then

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
it across so yeah go to go and then
computer<00:01:02.059> I'm<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.420> hard<00:01:03.600> drive

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
computer I'm going to your hard drive

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
computer I'm going to your hard drive
and<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> system<00:01:05.930> library<00:01:09.229> extensions<00:01:11.030> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and go to system library extensions and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.530 
and go to system library extensions and
these<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.650> correct<00:01:13.920> text

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
these want to find the correct text

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.850 
these want to find the correct text
which<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> where<00:01:19.770> you

this<00:01:24.150> point<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.810> sanity<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this point on to my sanity you want to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310 
this point on to my sanity you want to
remove<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.220> version<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> you'll<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.229> asked

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
for a password and then you want to copy

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.520 
for a password and then you want to copy
your<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.689> ten<00:01:33.840> points<00:01:34.049> upon<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.350> back

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
your one from ten points upon one back

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.330 
your one from ten points upon one back
in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
okay so at this point it's not actually

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
okay so at this point it's not actually
installed<00:01:44.130> properly<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.479> to
