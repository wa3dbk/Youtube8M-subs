I<00:00:00.060> wasn't<00:00:00.539> able<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.900> videotape<00:00:01.260> anyone<00:00:02.010> taking

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I wasn't able to videotape anyone taking

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.740 
I wasn't able to videotape anyone taking
the<00:00:02.550> cpat<00:00:02.970> so<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.659> took<00:00:03.810> it<00:00:04.140> myself<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.950> am<00:00:05.750> 120

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
the cpat so I took it myself I am 120

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.499 
the cpat so I took it myself I am 120
pounds<00:00:07.309> 52<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.809> I<00:00:09.809> don't<00:00:10.590> work<00:00:10.800> out<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.040> much

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
pounds 52 and I don't work out that much

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.940 
pounds 52 and I don't work out that much
so<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> haven't<00:00:12.929> been<00:00:12.990> training<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.559> test

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
so I haven't been training for this test

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.340 
so I haven't been training for this test
which<00:00:14.580> was<00:00:14.759> quite<00:00:15.030> obvious<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> CPAP

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
which was quite obvious to the CPAP

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.080 
which was quite obvious to the CPAP
Proctor's<00:00:16.890> think<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> prediction<00:00:17.880> will<00:00:17.970> be

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
Proctor's think the prediction will be

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
Proctor's think the prediction will be
fatigue<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.260> stair<00:00:19.439> stepper<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> hardest

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
fatigue on the stair stepper the hardest

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.010 
fatigue on the stair stepper the hardest
part<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.520> her<00:00:20.820> getting<00:00:21.449> through<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> ladder

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
part for her getting through the ladder

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.950

without<00:00:22.680> slipping<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> higher<00:00:23.630> if<00:00:24.630> she<00:00:24.779> gets

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
without slipping the higher if she gets

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
without slipping the higher if she gets
to<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.519> that'll<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.609> great<00:00:26.640> looking<00:00:27.300> at<00:00:27.420> her

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to that that'll be great looking at her

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300
