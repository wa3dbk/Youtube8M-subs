okay<00:00:00.840> here<00:00:01.020> we<00:00:01.050> are<00:00:01.530> all<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.669> wiring<00:00:02.939> here

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
okay here we are all this wiring here

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.050 
okay here we are all this wiring here
they<00:00:04.680> actually<00:00:04.740> goes<00:00:05.040> inside<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.580> cab<00:00:05.759> so

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
they actually goes inside the cab so

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.020 
they actually goes inside the cab so
just<00:00:06.509> sitting<00:00:06.660> there<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.080> moment<00:00:08.030> what

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
just sitting there for the moment what

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480 
just sitting there for the moment what
I've<00:00:09.179> done<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.660> put<00:00:10.200> everything<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.370> place

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I've done is put everything in place

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.770 
I've done is put everything in place
about<00:00:11.880> all<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> sensors<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:13.160> orbit<00:00:14.160> one

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
about all the sensors in orbit one

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
about all the sensors in orbit one
throttle<00:00:15.780> bodies<00:00:15.960> mounted<00:00:16.850> now<00:00:17.850> I've<00:00:17.910> just

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
throttle bodies mounted now I've just

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.429 
throttle bodies mounted now I've just
made<00:00:18.210> sure<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.690> there's<00:00:18.960> enough<00:00:19.080> length

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
made sure that there's enough length

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.689 
made sure that there's enough length
through<00:00:19.619> everything<00:00:19.890> there<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.400> wire

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
through everything there is one wire

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.160 
through everything there is one wire
that<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.570> happy<00:00:21.810> where<00:00:21.930> they're<00:00:22.020> going

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
that I'm not happy where they're going

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.679 
that I'm not happy where they're going
to<00:00:22.230> extend<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> length<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.180> I<00:00:24.180> think<00:00:24.600> it's

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to extend the length of it I think it's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779 
to extend the length of it I think it's
more<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.410> extractors<00:00:26.400> rather<00:00:26.609> than<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
more because of extractors rather than a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.130 
more because of extractors rather than a
manifold<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:29.660> everything<00:00:30.660> sort<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.929> sitting

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
manifold so everything sort of sitting

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740 
manifold so everything sort of sitting
in<00:00:31.230> place<00:00:31.410> where<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> live<00:00:32.510> not<00:00:33.510> screw

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
in place where it's and live not screw

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
in place where it's and live not screw
down<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.290> sitting<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.530> close<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.579> we

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
down it's just sitting there close so we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.709 
down it's just sitting there close so we
know<00:00:36.120> we've<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> length<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> yeah<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.719> we

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
know we've got the length so yeah so we

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
know we've got the length so yeah so we
go<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:41.809> look<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:49.739> shiny<00:00:50.070> new

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
go on down here look that shiny new

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.439 
go on down here look that shiny new
thing<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.850> section<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.300> knock

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
thing up there that section there knock

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
thing up there that section there knock
sensor<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> basically<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.280> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
sensor so you basically put that in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
sensor so you basically put that in
between<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> funniest<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> emotive<00:00:54.870> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
between in funniest and emotive so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
between in funniest and emotive so
that's<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> there<00:01:01.399> come<00:01:02.399> around<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> other

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that's in there come around the other

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.080 
that's in there come around the other
side<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:04.979> everything's<00:01:05.909> pretty

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
side so basically everything's pretty

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.490 
side so basically everything's pretty
much<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.659> plate<00:01:07.500> ready<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.330> my<00:01:09.500> water

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
much there plate ready to go my water

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.010 
much there plate ready to go my water
set<00:01:10.770> temperature<00:01:11.460> sensor<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.060> am<00:01:12.869> actually

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
set temperature sensor I am actually

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.960 
set temperature sensor I am actually
going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> mount<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to mount it in there I'm just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
going to mount it in there I'm just
having<00:01:15.299> troubles<00:01:15.689> getting<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.330> I'm

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
dropped a few wires in the back there

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
dropped a few wires in the back there
you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.009> speedo<00:01:29.369> sensor<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.030> other

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you know the speedo sensor and one other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.880 
you know the speedo sensor and one other
why<00:01:33.360> either<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> fuel<00:01:34.259> pump<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.740> run

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
why either down to the fuel pump so run

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
why either down to the fuel pump so run
that<00:01:34.920> wire<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> pretty<00:01:36.479> much<00:01:36.659> next

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that wire down there so pretty much next

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
that wire down there so pretty much next
left<00:01:37.170> knee<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> used<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> mount<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> fuel<00:01:38.310> pump

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
left knee I used to mount the fuel pump

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
left knee I used to mount the fuel pump
mount<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> fuel<00:01:39.299> line's<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.110> return<00:01:40.409> line

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
mount the fuel line's in the return line

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
mount the fuel line's in the return line
to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> tank<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.140> going

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to the tank and what I'm actually going

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
to the tank and what I'm actually going
to<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.880> take<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:45.180> dash<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> my<00:01:45.840> car<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to do is take my dash out of my car so I

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
to do is take my dash out of my car so I
can<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:47.850> meet<00:01:48.630> mount<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> computer<00:01:49.439> up

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
can actually meet mount the computer up

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
can actually meet mount the computer up
