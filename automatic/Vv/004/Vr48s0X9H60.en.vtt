 I wanted a tutorial on how to increase the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.110

 of wifi booster the wifi booster is a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.379
 cydia tweet which has the function

 to customize the list of networks 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.530
 wifi in settings 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.320
 once we install the following

 more features but above all we 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.659
 will allow us to improve our wifi signal 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 of our device and I hope it's 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.100
 of your liking the following tutorial 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.170
 ok let's start with the tutorial what 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.300
 first thing we're going to do is open 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.400
 silvia the tweet that we are going to occupy in 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.710
 this tutorial is called wifi booster 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.390
 has a commercial cost of 2 dollars 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.940
 but in this tutorial we're going to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.369
 download totally free for this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.380
 we have to add a repo we 're going to 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.950
 go in fountains 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.530
 and we are going to edit and then we give 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.640
 in adding and we write the following repo 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.640
 to add it 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.230
 once we have written it down we are going 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.650
 to give in adding source and wait for 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.650
 update 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.390
 We wait for the url to be verified 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.660
 now here we see this notice due 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.119
 that in this network we find tweets from 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.800
 pay attention but here they are totally 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.660
 free so there's no problem 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.660
 we just add in anyway 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.890
 ok and now we have to wait for it to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 update the data 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.359
 This process does not take long, they are just 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.379
 a few seconds in what the 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.379
 source update 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.250
 let's wait 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 ok once it's over we give in 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.630
 return to libya 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.870
 and we give in ready now as we can see 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.160
 we have installed the following challenge 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 Now what we have to do is what 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.770
 next and it's the ones to look for and here we go 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.770

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.700
 they will appear several options of 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.530
 installation but which we are going to occupy 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.990
 in this case it is the first one that has a 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 blue icon since it is the one of the repo 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.940
 that we just installed and it's totally 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.980
 free since a yellow one has 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.740
 a cost of 2 dollars but the first one is 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.900

 once this box appears 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.069
 we just have to give in confirming the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.290

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.629
