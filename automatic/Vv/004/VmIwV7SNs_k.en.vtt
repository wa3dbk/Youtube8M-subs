going to have all of these these chain

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.950 
going to have all of these these chain
tens<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:57.379> just<00:00:58.379> hanging<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.960> one

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
tens here just hanging out here and one

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of them is in the back and you just pull

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
of them is in the back and you just pull
it<00:01:02.910> forward<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> probably

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it forward and that is going to probably

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.539 
it forward and that is going to probably
look<00:01:08.220> pretty<00:01:08.790> funny<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.340> I've<00:01:11.340> done

look pretty funny to you and I've done
just<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.970> small<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.960> swatch<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.040> show

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just a small little swatch here to show

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.480 
just a small little swatch here to show
you<00:01:14.720> what<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> looks<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.220> all

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.560 
you what it looks like see they're all
these<00:01:17.850> chain<00:01:18.330> tens<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> pattern

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
these chain tens and the pattern

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
these chain tens and the pattern
actually<00:01:21.750> has<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.270> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
actually has more of these but I'm just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
actually has more of these but I'm just
showing<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> small<00:01:26.400> swatch<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
showing you on a small swatch so that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
showing you on a small swatch so that
you<00:01:27.450> understand<00:01:28.140> what's<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

take<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> first<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.140> just

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
take the first one and you just

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.109 
take the first one and you just
interlock<00:01:48.180> them

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
interlock them

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
interlock them
and<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.380> go<00:01:50.649> up<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.520> line

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and you just go up the line

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.090 
and you just go up the line
interlocking<00:01:53.740> them<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.500> way<00:01:56.619> up<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
interlocking them all the way up to the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.170 
interlocking them all the way up to the
top<00:01:58.829> just<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:02.439> all<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.920> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
top just do that that's all you do and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.339 
top just do that that's all you do and
it<00:02:04.180> makes<00:02:04.390> this<00:02:04.630> big<00:02:04.930> textured<00:02:06.750> part<00:02:07.750> here<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
it makes this big textured part here and

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.250 
it makes this big textured part here and
because<00:02:08.800> I'm<00:02:08.950> using<00:02:09.160> homespun<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.360> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
because I'm using homespun here it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
because I'm using homespun here it
almost<00:02:11.500> looks<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.160> cable<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.630> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
almost looks like a cable it's it's a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
almost looks like a cable it's it's a
faux<00:02:14.500> cable<00:02:15.040> very<00:02:15.340> much<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> fake<00:02:15.970> cable<00:02:16.830> but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
faux cable very much a fake cable but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.259 
faux cable very much a fake cable but
still<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.760> almost<00:02:19.450> looks<00:02:19.720> like<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:21.269> now

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
still it just almost looks like one now

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.500 
still it just almost looks like one now
once<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.660> get<00:02:22.840> them<00:02:23.049> all<00:02:24.060> interlocked<00:02:25.060> then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
once you get them all interlocked then

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.920 
once you get them all interlocked then
you'll<00:02:25.750> go<00:02:25.870> ahead<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.380> do<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> next<00:02:26.680> row<00:02:27.340> or

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you'll go ahead and do the next row or

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.539 
you'll go ahead and do the next row or
round<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.410> pattern<00:02:29.739> because<00:02:30.100> it's<00:02:30.280> worked

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
round in the pattern because it's worked

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.570 
round in the pattern because it's worked
in<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> round<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> worked<00:02:32.110> flat

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
in the round and this is worked flat

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.210 
in the round and this is worked flat
this<00:02:33.580> little<00:02:33.970> swatch<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.739> I've<00:02:35.739> already

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
this little swatch so I've already

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.490 
this little swatch so I've already
started<00:02:36.549> this<00:02:37.830> row<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.810> all<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.019> do<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
started this row here and all you do is

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.229 
started this row here and all you do is
just<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.220> chain<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.640> work<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
just a chain one and then you work a

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.610 
just a chain one and then you work a
single<00:02:46.900> crochet<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:49.390> top<00:02:49.420> loop<00:02:52.620> that's

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
single crochet into the top loop that's

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.090 
single crochet into the top loop that's
all<00:02:53.890> very<00:02:54.370> simple<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.380> binds<00:02:56.380> all<00:02:56.890> of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
all very simple and that binds all of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.750 
all very simple and that binds all of
the<00:02:57.280> interlocking<00:02:58.950> chain<00:02:59.950> spaces<00:03:00.340> together

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the interlocking chain spaces together

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.440 
the interlocking chain spaces together
and<00:03:01.359> another<00:03:01.630> chain<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.739> then<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.420> just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
and another chain one and then you just

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.840 
and another chain one and then you just
follow<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.200> pattern<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.030> remainder<00:03:08.850> and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
follow the pattern for the remainder and

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.020 
follow the pattern for the remainder and
I'll<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.329> go<00:03:10.540> across<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.140> fast

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
I'll just go across really fast

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
I'll just go across really fast
just<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.829> can<00:03:15.040> show<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.340> another<00:03:15.579> one

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
just so that I can show you another one

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.090 
just so that I can show you another one
and<00:03:18.359> this<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.600> mini<00:03:19.959> swatch<00:03:20.590> it's<00:03:20.889> not

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
and this is a mini swatch it's not

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.970 
and this is a mini swatch it's not
exactly<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.730> way<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.470> pattern<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.100> written

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
exactly the way the pattern is written

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.740 
exactly the way the pattern is written
it's<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.400> mini<00:03:27.579> swatch<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.480> can

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
it's just a mini swatch so that you can

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.970 
it's just a mini swatch so that you can

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
crochets here in between them but that

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.539 
crochets here in between them but that
was<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.549> purpose<00:03:38.010> I've<00:03:39.010> already<00:03:39.280> done<00:03:39.430> the
