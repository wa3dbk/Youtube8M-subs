00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 the caffè latte 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.219
 you put it in a glass this is a small one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 caffè latte and then a shot goes 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 espresso in for the rest milk and one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.890
 small layer of foam that I am already 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 lubricate a flush 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.300
 cuckoo ticking and you do a lot 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 cleaning to bake 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.490
 just a whole cloth with a dry cloth 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 have stubborn coffee leftovers 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 kamal of the centuries just under the warm 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 keep a tap but then you have to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.640
 dry well as well because you can 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.879
 in advance can not be wet- 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.739
 because then it burns again for you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.329
 making espresso as typing 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 and then go carefully until it's a nice one 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.420
 is equally distributed 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.949
 well we temper him put a lock 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.510
 once whole heart busy from 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.140
 my shoulder with my arm in the corner 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 of 90 degrees 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 weigh well with your flat hand 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 along the sides at the out 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 runs 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
 then you can always order the latter 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 smooth out leftovers and just a little 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.409
 polishing to we finished and cleaning lady 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.200
 put prime rib 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.960
 press the button inside the fire and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.250
 to convert 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.119
 the coffee is ready 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.520
 but then of course we go the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 milk frother I've got my can that again 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.740
 filled up to this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.539
 I steam steam belly what is allowed 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 that really just blow steam differently 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.920
 then blow water into your brand that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.720
 continues you mark again 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 put a right angle and you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.429
 is that current with border and sound 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 there on the menu with month that he is hot 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.670
 answers and that they are the moment 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.739
 I a deeper in the sky 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.970
 I create a scenario to you up to three 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.800
 counting if I now turn with my 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.810
 can use my wrist for that hot 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.849
 then you see the milk 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 gradually glimmer and that there 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.020
 actually no bubbles in it 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.580
 if i put all this milk in this you can 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.590
 let me have it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.540
 or just foam or just 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.500
 milk and of course I want a bit of it 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.750
 both 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 I donate so that most 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.610
 Foam in this can make you sit and for it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.340
 least foam my other can is needed 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.570
 which is also good on the move 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.400
 my glass with it 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.320
 very little bit obliquely making it 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 surface of milk chromed 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.390
 I start high by pouring through the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.660
 crema layer a bit no white spots 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.570
 and then I draw 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.340
 and if I put it down well then you see 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.800
 that you have a head of foam about 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 half an inch so nice and thin 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.340
 foam comes with a lot of milk and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.340
 that's coffee wrong
