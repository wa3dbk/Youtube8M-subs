into<00:00:32.610> amino<00:00:32.880> acids<00:00:33.270> well<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
into amino acids well you know you can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
into amino acids well you know you can
do<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> other<00:00:35.700> things<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
so and the biggest thing that changed me

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.490 
so and the biggest thing that changed me
it<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> something<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.570> the
