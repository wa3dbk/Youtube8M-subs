100 this red is 100 okay arcs are
generally<00:02:05.579> used<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.409> freeways<00:02:07.409> highways<00:02:08.450> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
generally used on freeways highways and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.430 
generally used on freeways highways and
and<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.410> problem<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.370> know

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and if a problem you know

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.860 
and if a problem you know
asks<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.580> figure<00:02:13.940> out<00:02:14.120> what<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.600> degree

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
asks you to figure out what the degree

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.500 
asks you to figure out what the degree
of<00:02:14.990> curvature<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:15.950> now<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.270> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
of curvature is for now you know this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.710 
of curvature is for now you know this
this<00:02:17.900> curve<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.560> they<00:02:18.650> don't<00:02:19.180> tell<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
this curve and they don't tell you you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.440 
this curve and they don't tell you you
know<00:02:21.350> if<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.800> an<00:02:22.040> arc<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.580> cord<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.090> just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
know if it's an arc or cord you just

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.360 
know if it's an arc or cord you just
assume<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.230> art<00:02:24.500> arcs<00:02:24.920> always<00:02:25.220> the

assume that it's art arcs always the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
assume that it's art arcs always the
default<00:02:25.580> okay<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.310> quartz<00:02:28.310> are<00:02:28.490> usually<00:02:29.000> used

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
default okay and quartz are usually used

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.830

for you know train tracks railways and
that<00:02:33.500> sort<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.860> stuff<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:37.030> let's<00:02:38.030> let's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
that sort of stuff so let's let's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.700 
that sort of stuff so let's let's
actually<00:02:38.540> work<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:39.080> arcs<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:41.680> degree<00:02:42.680> of

going<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> call<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.770> D<00:02:46.070> D<00:02:46.550> as<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.700> dog<00:02:47.470> degree

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
going to call it D D as in dog degree

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.510 
going to call it D D as in dog degree
with<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:49.010> degree<00:02:49.790> sign<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.630> okay<00:02:50.960> and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
with a little degree sign on it okay and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.940 
with a little degree sign on it okay and
degree<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.640> curvatures<00:02:53.260> only<00:02:54.260> apply<00:02:54.590> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
degree of curvatures only apply to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.520 
degree of curvatures only apply to
curves<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.640> are<00:02:55.700> lengths<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.330> 100<00:02:57.020> feet<00:02:57.230> or

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
curves that are lengths of 100 feet or

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.220 
curves that are lengths of 100 feet or
cords<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.490> are<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.640> length<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.150> 100<00:02:59.660> feet<00:02:59.810> okay

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
cords that are a length of 100 feet okay

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.820 
cords that are a length of 100 feet okay
so<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.490> our<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:02.660> our<00:03:05.350> degree<00:03:06.350> of

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
so this is our this is our degree of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.660 
so this is our this is our degree of
curvature<00:03:07.760> okay<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> figure<00:03:10.310> out<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
curvature okay so to figure out the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.820 
curvature okay so to figure out the
degree<00:03:10.820> of<00:03:11.120> curvature<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.960> can<00:03:12.140> actually<00:03:12.350> use

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
degree of curvature we can actually use

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.120 
degree of curvature we can actually use
the<00:03:13.160> formulas<00:03:13.670> we've<00:03:13.880> been<00:03:14.660> using<00:03:14.960> or<00:03:15.350> we<00:03:15.830> have

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
the formulas we've been using or we have

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.130 
the formulas we've been using or we have
derived<00:03:16.820> from<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:18.230> other<00:03:18.470> other<00:03:18.950> videos<00:03:19.430> okay

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
derived from the other other videos okay

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.990 
derived from the other other videos okay
so<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.200> order<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.500> figure<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.820> what<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
so in order to figure out what the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.360 
so in order to figure out what the
degree<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.690> here<00:03:24.350> or<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.950> degree<00:03:25.190> of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
degree is here or the degree of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.160 
degree is here or the degree of
curvature<00:03:25.700> for<00:03:26.120> an<00:03:26.210> arc<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.920> simply<00:03:28.340> do

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
curvature for an arc is you simply do

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.750 
curvature for an arc is you simply do
let's<00:03:30.170> let's<00:03:30.470> relate<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> circumference<00:03:31.520> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
let's let's relate the circumference and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.820 
let's let's relate the circumference and
the<00:03:31.940> length<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.630> interior<00:03:33.110> angle<00:03:33.470> or<00:03:33.710> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
the length and the interior angle or the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.060 
the length and the interior angle or the
degree<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.130> curvature<00:03:34.460> and<00:03:35.410> 360<00:03:36.410> degrees<00:03:36.740> of<00:03:36.950> a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
degree of curvature and 360 degrees of a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.670 
degree of curvature and 360 degrees of a
circle<00:03:37.460> so<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.690> say<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.020> 2<00:03:39.200> pi<00:03:39.470> R<00:03:40.600> is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
circle so we can say that 2 pi R is

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.370 
circle so we can say that 2 pi R is
equal<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.920> or<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.780> 100<00:03:45.020> as<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:48.070> 360<00:03:49.070> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
equal to or is is to 100 as this 360 is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.570 
equal to or is is to 100 as this 360 is
to<00:03:51.380> degree<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.670> Arc<00:03:53.260> okay<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.560> using<00:03:55.459> this

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
to degree of Arc okay and using this

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.710 
to degree of Arc okay and using this
formula<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:57.160> can<00:03:58.160> figure<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:59.120> radius<00:03:59.300> or

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
formula we can figure out the radius or

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.120 
formula we can figure out the radius or
we<00:03:59.840> can<00:04:00.020> figure<00:04:00.200> out<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.560> degree<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.860> Arc

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
we can figure out the degree of Arc

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.030 
we can figure out the degree of Arc
given<00:04:01.580> one<00:04:01.790> or<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.090> other<00:04:02.800> okay

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
given one or the other okay

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.210 
given one or the other okay
and<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:05.240> chords<00:04:05.930> well<00:04:06.620> it's<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.950> same<00:04:07.160> thing

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and for chords well it's the same thing

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.699 
and for chords well it's the same thing
we<00:04:07.700> actually<00:04:08.360> derived<00:04:08.720> an<00:04:08.930> equation<00:04:09.140> I

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
we actually derived an equation I

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.390 
we actually derived an equation I
believe<00:04:10.570> in<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.780> last<00:04:11.959> video<00:04:12.380> for<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.190> view

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
believe in the last video for the view

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.780 
believe in the last video for the view
before<00:04:13.580> not<00:04:14.540> sure<00:04:14.750> but<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:15.740> said<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.160> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
before not sure but we said that the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.360 
before not sure but we said that the
long<00:04:17.060> cord<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:19.220> equal<00:04:19.670> to<00:04:19.820> 2r<00:04:20.419> sine<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.859> Delta

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
long cord is equal to 2r sine of Delta

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.030 
long cord is equal to 2r sine of Delta
over<00:04:23.240> 2

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
over 2

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.970 
over 2
okay<00:04:24.730> in<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.750> case<00:04:25.990> our<00:04:26.230> long<00:04:26.470> cord<00:04:26.770> is

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
okay in this case our long cord is

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.000 
okay in this case our long cord is
always<00:04:27.400> 100<00:04:28.000> feet<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:30.070> our<00:04:30.100> sign<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:32.010> instead

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
always 100 feet to our sign and instead

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.090 
always 100 feet to our sign and instead
of<00:04:33.160> Delta<00:04:33.370> now<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.270> degree<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.430> cord

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
of Delta now it's a degree of cord

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.400 
of Delta now it's a degree of cord
/<00:04:39.100> -<00:04:40.200> okay

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
/ - okay

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.940 
/ - okay
so<00:04:42.370> degree<00:04:42.550> of<00:04:42.730> curvatures<00:04:43.360> are<00:04:43.510> only<00:04:43.660> used<00:04:43.990> to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
so degree of curvatures are only used to

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.930 
so degree of curvatures are only used to
figure<00:04:45.520> out<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.030> radius<00:04:46.410> for<00:04:47.410> curves<00:04:48.040> for<00:04:48.880> an

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
figure out the radius for curves for an

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.120 
figure out the radius for curves for an
arc<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.420> has<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> curved<00:04:49.930> length<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.440> 100<00:04:50.920> or

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
arc that has a curved length of 100 or

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.950 
arc that has a curved length of 100 or
four<00:04:51.400> cords<00:04:51.790> that<00:04:52.000> have<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.180> cord<00:04:52.570> length<00:04:52.780> of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
four cords that have a cord length of

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.120 
four cords that have a cord length of
100<00:04:53.500> okay<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.930> these<00:04:56.230> are<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.530> two<00:04:56.680> formulas

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
100 okay and these are the two formulas

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.300 
100 okay and these are the two formulas
we<00:04:57.280> can<00:04:57.430> use<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:58.570> one<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.290> arc<00:04:59.470> and<00:04:59.770> this

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
we can use this one for the arc and this

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.660 
we can use this one for the arc and this
one<00:05:00.580> for<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.390> cord
