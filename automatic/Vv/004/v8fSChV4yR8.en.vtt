00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.529
 and this is the 59th edition heading master for all 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.779
 tanks heading in which i get a mark 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.869
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 today on the menu we have in over 120 chinese 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 medium tank level 9 which is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 not quite normal stitch i probably would 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.230
 compared it with the t-34 these three tanks are very 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 similar and stand out from their 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 classmates 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 The distinguishing feature of Chinese is very 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.390
 powerful instrument which even envy 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 some heavy tanks but at the same time 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 it's a double-edged sword which will 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 set fire to not only opponents but also your 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 a chair about how to keep warm with 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 this tool cold rainy 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 in the evenings I will tell you later 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.109
 let's find out what it is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.120
 the dynamics of our medium tank 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 of course after pokatushek on amx 30 b 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.650
 Chinese dynamics may not seem 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.350
 very impressive but nonetheless she 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.260
 quite suitable top speed forward 56 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 kilometers per hour ago 20 120 is capable 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 operatively occupy key positions 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.470
 change direction or return to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 base protection therefore not worth it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.950
 neglect 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.380
 with all this, the vase has some 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 armor for example in ld 100 millimeters under 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.570
 very good slope and hull sides 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.009
 has an armor thickness of 80 millimeters 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.750
 true given the fact that practically 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 always have to fight with tanks 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 ninth and tenth level such armor 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 corps is unlikely to save although sometimes 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.450
 ricochet and no penetration but 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
 still i recommend don't hope for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 armor anyway corps here with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.630
 towers and things are better 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.509
 it has a round ricochet shape 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.149
 noodle 220 millimeters + gun mask 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.430
 which breaks very rarely on 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.590
 practice if you managed to take a position 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
 for the game from the tower then you are quite good 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.210
 You can tank the same from the point 9 10 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 level heavy tanks and sometimes even 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 rhymes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 but of course as long as any of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.649
 they will be charged with premium shells or 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.500
 will start shooting in the handle and the roof of the tower 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.540
 By the way before I forget it is necessary 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.440
 say about the fire and it is not now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.600
 about my 100 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.140
 about it a little later but the fire for 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.510
 this tank is the norm 120 burns perfectly 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.790
 and head on because there are fuel tanks and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 in the stern because there is also the engine 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.470
 so I highly recommend even with 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 Bleed extinguishing carry a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.910
 fire extinguisher otherwise second 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.920
 the fire will not survive not your tank is not yours 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.240
 chair now it's time 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.460
 talk about the gun 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320
 if I were asked to describe the gun in and 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 behind one word it would be a word 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.740
 extreme tool extreme what is in it 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.630
 such a great breakthrough 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.080
 armor-piercing projectile 250 millimeters and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.670
 it would noggin they sabot u 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.640
 cumulative breaking even more to him 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.230
 virtually any armor 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 one-time damage from our medium gun 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.730
 the tank is just a huge 440 units not 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 each weight can boast such 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.330
 an indicator 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.250
 breakthrough and one-time damage is one side 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.140
 medals the other side is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.970
 firing rate without rammer 5 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.520
 shots per minute i.e. recharge 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 already 12 seconds is not the best accuracy 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.910
 038 spread over 100 meters and very long 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.830
 data time in three and a half seconds 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.020
 these dry numbers make it clear why 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.880
 I said that this is an extreme tool with 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.450
 one hand high penetration and one-time 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.760
 damage 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.890
 us another very long recharge not 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.500
 the best accuracy and gigantic time 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 information and it would seem to be normal 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.550
 use this weapon and deal damage 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.070
 enough to shoot on middle and near 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.040
 distances and at the same time be reduced to the end 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.220
 distribute until depot 440 and everything will be 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.750
 fine but no it's not that easy 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 still extreme number two 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.489
 namely inconsistency or how it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.709
 called us tankers FBG 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.200
 which for some reason is on this tank 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.170
 manifested much more often and caused me 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.890
 constantly and burning imagine such 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.140
 the situation 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.450
 you have an opponent in it 400 points 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.790
 strength and he shot out that is 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.010
 nothing prevents you from going down 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.880
 shoot and send him to the hangar 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.970
 great you are doing that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.239
 converge aim the vulnerable area 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.870
 are shooting 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.109
 and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.919
 and 380 damage allies caps 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.050
 finish off 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.479
 and everything seems to be fine but somehow it is not very 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.860
 comfortable a little lower back temperature 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.410
 the stage rises a little 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.300
 but oh well who does not happen all the cases EBE 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.220
 think alpha flew less than 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.250
 par over there is still a little red with 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.860
 400 hp will go kill him drive up 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.870
 do all the same manipulations are reduced 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.690
 we aim we shoot and 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.139
 399 how much do you speak average 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.830
 Damage 440 Yes, well, thanks at least 380 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.320
 399 well already already pleases more but the smell on 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.570
 harry feels absolutely the same 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.000
 situation and with accuracy you can up 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.490
 the end come down to wait was still a second 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.110
 but for sure shoot it get into 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.229
 land in the house in stone in the caterpillar but 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.120
 just donâ€™t damage truth in defense 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.310
 choice should be said that often 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.110
 there are absolutely opposite 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.110
 situations that is when you crashes 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.180
 480 500 damage and when you are with the guard as 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.000
 the real Soviet so get 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.370
 at 400 meters but you know why guys 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.080
 then they set the negative situations 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.930
 significantly better than positive 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.289
 stew and so while I rode on the tower 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.940
 I burned very well and also 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.190
 there are wonderful chinese corners 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.520
 vertical guidance 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.990
 Oh, these are -3 degrees and this is after minus 8 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.570
 on amx 30 b 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.520
 how did I miss you so much 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.639
 fun guys you just don't 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.740
 imagine perhaps the only thing 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.900
 I was saved from the final explosion is 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.919
 very fast master managed to get 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.050
 him in the third battle 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.349
 but in general to earn profit on you 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.229
 120 need about 1250 in the net 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.210
 experience get so much experience real 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.669
 only when you try to play enough 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.770
 actively and moderately aggressively vases for 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.470
 This is all a good speaker. 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.539
 strong enough tower high single 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.300
 damage and review in 390 meters 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.550
 all this allows 120 to occupy the necessary 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.370
 positions shoot back and highlight 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.340
 for its allies it is also very important 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.560
 if you want to get a master this 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.840
 Chinese is no ordinary medium tank with him 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.169
 There are advantages and disadvantages from 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.569
 which I have a little chair from 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.419
 but nevertheless I am sure that there are players 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:37.090
 who really like this age 20 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.749
 We say big love to Chinese 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.639
 technique and may the master be with you 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:44.889
 that's all for today thanks for all 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.520
 attention with you was tiberian participate 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.289
 in the survey 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.449
 and choose a tank for the next release 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.699
 and also don't forget to subscribe to 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.949
 channel here's a fan and look into my channel 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.490
 there are also many different masters up 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.490
 new meetings
