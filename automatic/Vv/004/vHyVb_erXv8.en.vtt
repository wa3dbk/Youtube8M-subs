00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.410
 no no 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.529
 welcome to a map that both 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.720
 subscribers - a map called parkour 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.189
 is able to titanic the edge of the boat 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500
 of the titan and so that he knows that I 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.279
 I had people who do not know him but hey 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.539
 The truth is that I was surprised 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.650
 quite because he told me that he has 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.840
 thrown away like a couple of months is 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.730
 making the map and as always if you 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.519
 you have made this map advised the ship 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 Well, you have, it's amazing, because 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.629
 the map until really real is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.339
 the titanic as a medium dump to value 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.140
 realistic more can not and good then 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.579
 first let's start reading the the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.339
 booklets like now left here but 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.199
 wrong and this story and we're going to 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.970
 see if this map lazio the whole if not 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.229
 well well I still appreciate it and if not 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.420
 that we will give you credits even though you have created 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.519
 what is the ship we are going to read without more 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.229
 subscribed to who tells us history are you 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.570
 in the titanic you are a guest you must climb 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.369
 or if you will not die you must escape the titanic 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.170
 doing parkour and they came to speedboat 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.640
 salvation 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.350
 Today is something realistic and right now I am 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.159
 how is this leonardo dicaprio 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.840
 trying to be able to save us with you are in 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.119
 the kit animals already read me and the other 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.830
 it was day night games as you want is 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.370
 recommended at night to see the pixel 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.260
 would burn like how is the subject 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.220
 Ah, although the night game does 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.540
 truth is that the put of much more 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 face because it was very cool the subject of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.980
 to be able to see the titanic in the dark 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 like how the movie really happens 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.610
 happens if you're in the night and everything is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.320
 apart and well here we have a t 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.640
 inverted and you already know that you can 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 send any map at an arroba 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 yahoo.es and as I always say though 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.730
 these maps look if it's there says brito 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.190
 there that football although these maps do not 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.290
 has created the all or equal yes that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.610
 I like them equally, that is to say 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.980
 if you have any map for the pool that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.330
 is not fair because it is interesting and that 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.950
 I can enjoy when you know that I 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.480
 you can send kobe ​​of knowledge that better 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.700
 sets and if not a message above 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.230
 youtube there you are seeing what you have 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.590
 the god ship trip is beautiful saints 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.490
 of 4 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 I did this parkour without roads 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 and well surely you are seeing this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.790
 videos and so on is because I'll already be 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.830

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.190

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.240
 bring another lifeboat to be 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.240
 more solid quieter 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.500
 perfect perfect a little bit of parkour 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.770
 I think there's in the free pixela we 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.390
 can explain the system to talk about 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.310
 as wide as expected by the person 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.680
 but well let's see the final 'pixel 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.460
 postscript and youtube and let's start with 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.890

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.000
 pixel of stepping to see if you liked it and not 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.580

 of gamer beings like those he gives from 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.270
 maps because they see that your map has been 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.520
 valued they liked it and this would motivate 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.380
 to be leaving behind other types of maps 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.630

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.720
 of we are 307,000 when I'm recording 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.000
 this and I am very happy because it makes 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.890
 nothing was going up 300,000 special and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.210
 that increase in how fast it grows 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.869
 of variety with new series and with a 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:54.249
