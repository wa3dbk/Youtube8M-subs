00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.299
 since he bought his campsite because he 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.460
 six years ago yves kiberlain use it to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.019
 every vacancy on the small roads the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 rolling house sneaks everywhere 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.219
 for him camping because it's freedom 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.509
 compared to what we live all year 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 we have jobs that are still 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.990
 taking enough there is a lot of stress 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 etc. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.539
 it's a way of having a space for 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.160
 freedom 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.269
 a moment of the year that really helps 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 of what in the kimberlain family we 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 likes to ride while driving the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 camping car 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 maÃ«l florian isabelle take advantage of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.160
 bike paths we like to go to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.140
 thread over landscapes over 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.399
 cravings 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 and then take the time to land there 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.309
 where we want to ask when they are 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.050
 post to the campsites 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.920
 that exceptionally and navigates to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.690
 the old but camping is not 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.000
 their thing is rather to sleep in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 wilderness 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.690
 it's going to be pretty good there 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.930
 after the camping holidays because it's 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.869
 become a habit 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.560
 result the family is well established in 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.000
 five minutes 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 the township is settled and the meal and in 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.390
 could have listened to the sound the frame is 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.710
 ideal for a single meal in the world at 17 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.659
 and 20 years old both boys do live 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.369
 more at their parents so choose to 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.560
 spend three weeks alone with your family 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.880
 it may sound strange but not so much 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.020
 that always friends and all that to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.820
 Paris and then here 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 the family to change 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.280
 to relax a little but it seems 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.410
 did the same things we wake up 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.820
 globally even away at about the same 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.320
 they have an interest in having the same rhythm 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 because their housing and technique 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 I beg you after long in the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.640
 twelve square meters of the camping car 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.100
 find the kitchen the bathroom and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.830
 storage and of course beds for 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.840
 4 people so very little privacy ya 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.670
 dad who's snoring and apparently me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.600
 I speak 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.070
 but other than that he goes anyway 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.130
 the vast majority of their time outside 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.140
 by bike or visit for the camping car 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.140
 it's almost castle life
