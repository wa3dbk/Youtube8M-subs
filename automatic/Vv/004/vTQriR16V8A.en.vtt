fun enjoy doing this this would be the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.160 
fun enjoy doing this this would be the
second<00:00:37.590> time<00:00:37.680> last<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.460> person<00:00:38.640> won

second time last time the person won

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.280 
second time last time the person won
both<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.520> poet<00:00:41.879> were<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
