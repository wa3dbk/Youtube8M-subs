00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
inside that barrel we have a green brick

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.360 
inside that barrel we have a green brick
and<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.740> green<00:02:24.190> gem<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.380> tree<00:02:26.590> has<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> rotating

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and a green gem the tree has a rotating

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
and a green gem the tree has a rotating
feature<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.140> can<00:02:29.350> rotate<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.920> tree

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
feature on it so you can rotate the tree

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.900 
feature on it so you can rotate the tree
all<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.440> way<00:02:32.530> around<00:02:32.850> 360<00:02:33.850> degrees<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:35.910> then

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
all the way around 360 degrees and then

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.290 
all the way around 360 degrees and then
there's<00:02:37.120> also<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.830> launch<00:02:39.130> feature<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.060> here

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
there's also the launch feature on here

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.250 
there's also the launch feature on here
which<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.230> right<00:02:41.710> here<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.020> do<00:02:44.140> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
which is right here and all you do is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.190 
which is right here and all you do is
tap<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.240> launches<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.990> also

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
tap that and it launches that and also

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.850 
tap that and it launches that and also
what<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.650> does<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:49.050> kind<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.110> separates<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
what it does is it kind of separates the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
what it does is it kind of separates the
trees<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.310> kind<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.670> hidden<00:02:52.590> launch<00:02:54.330> so

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
trees so it's kind of a hidden launch so

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.050 
trees so it's kind of a hidden launch so
we'll<00:02:57.180> take<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:59.280> stick<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> minifigure<00:03:00.850> in

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
we'll take this stick the minifigure in

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.880 
we'll take this stick the minifigure in
there<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.540> launch<00:03:01.900> them<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:05.020> wall<00:03:05.200> also<00:03:05.500> has

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
there and launch them the wall also has

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.220 
there and launch them the wall also has
places<00:03:06.190> where<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.760> fold<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.180> there's<00:03:07.960> two

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
places where you can fold it there's two

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.930 
places where you can fold it there's two
sections<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.010> can<00:03:09.250> kind<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.610> bend<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.880> like

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
sections so you can kind of bend it like

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.810 
sections so you can kind of bend it like
that<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.310> shape<00:03:12.580> if<00:03:12.790> you

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
that and have it in that shape if you

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.910 
that and have it in that shape if you
like<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.770> then<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.030> detachable<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.710> if<00:03:17.830> you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
like and then it is detachable so if you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.560 
like and then it is detachable so if you
wanted<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.280> pull<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> wall<00:03:18.850> off<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.270> just<00:03:19.420> use

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
wanted to pull the wall off and just use

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.200 
wanted to pull the wall off and just use
that<00:03:19.720> little<00:03:19.780> section<00:03:20.200> itself<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.880> could<00:03:22.060> do

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
that little section itself you could do

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.390 
that little section itself you could do
that<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:22.960> separate<00:03:23.560> from<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.950> tree<00:03:24.220> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
that you know separate from the tree and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.210 
that you know separate from the tree and
then<00:03:25.390> also<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.320> said<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.740> can<00:03:26.890> pull<00:03:27.070> off

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
then also like I said you can pull off

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.460 
then also like I said you can pull off
the<00:03:27.400> weapons<00:03:27.730> rack<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.050> separate

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the weapons rack and have that separate

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.190 
the weapons rack and have that separate
so<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.680> got<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> few<00:03:30.490> pieces<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:32.110> can

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
so you got a few pieces that you can

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.430 
so you got a few pieces that you can
actually<00:03:32.520> move<00:03:33.520> around<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:35.020> do<00:03:35.200> different

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
actually move around and do different

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.520 
actually move around and do different
things<00:03:35.650> with<00:03:36.390> okay<00:03:37.390> so<00:03:37.450> let's<00:03:37.870> take<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> look<00:03:38.350> at

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
things with okay so let's take a look at

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.930 
things with okay so let's take a look at
the<00:03:38.620> minifigures<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.310> come<00:03:39.490> in<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:39.730> set

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the minifigures that come in this set

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.140 
the minifigures that come in this set
this<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.920> Thranduil

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
this is Thranduil

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.240 
this is Thranduil
he<00:03:43.390> does<00:03:43.600> come<00:03:43.780> with<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.140> really<00:03:44.410> cool<00:03:44.740> crown

here is a look at him with the cape
removed<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.770> then<00:04:02.770> we'll<00:04:02.980> take<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.250> look<00:04:03.370> at

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
removed and then we'll take a look at

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.690 
removed and then we'll take a look at
the<00:04:03.970> graphics<00:04:04.420> underneath<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.230> he<00:04:06.070> does<00:04:06.400> come

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
the graphics underneath and he does come

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.310 
the graphics underneath and he does come
with<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.120> double-sided<00:04:07.630> face

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.070 

here's<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.560> Mirkwood<00:04:14.920> elf<00:04:15.600> he<00:04:16.600> does<00:04:16.810> come

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
here's the Mirkwood elf he does come

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.390 
here's the Mirkwood elf he does come
with<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:18.070> long<00:04:18.280> hair<00:04:18.550> piece<00:04:18.790> there<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:21.120> then

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
with the long hair piece there and then

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.880 
with the long hair piece there and then
he<00:04:24.400> does<00:04:24.640> have<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.690> double-sided<00:04:26.200> face<00:04:26.530> and

he does have the double-sided face and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.620 
he does have the double-sided face and
then<00:04:27.430> there's<00:04:27.640> kind<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.060> better<00:04:28.210> look<00:04:28.450> at

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
then there's kind of a better look at

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.110 
then there's kind of a better look at
the<00:04:28.660> graphics<00:04:29.230> with<00:04:29.920> his<00:04:30.070> hairpiece<00:04:30.340> removed

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.140 

and<00:04:34.120> he<00:04:34.600> also<00:04:34.750> does<00:04:35.050> come<00:04:35.320> with<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.610> elven

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
and he also does come with the elven

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.220 
and he also does come with the elven
blade<00:04:38.340> here<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.670> Mirkwood<00:04:40.000> archer<00:04:40.810> we

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
blade here is the Mirkwood archer we

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.030 
blade here is the Mirkwood archer we
actually<00:04:41.650> get<00:04:41.800> two<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.190> these<00:04:42.670> in<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.150> set<00:04:44.040> he

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
actually get two of these in the set he

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.070 
actually get two of these in the set he
does<00:04:45.250> come<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:46.000> quiver<00:04:46.420> both<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.960> them

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
does come with a quiver both of them

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.670 
does come with a quiver both of them
come<00:04:47.260> with<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.410> quiver<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:51.420> then<00:04:52.440> they<00:04:53.440> both

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
come with a quiver and then they both

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.920 
come with a quiver and then they both
have<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:55.060> double-sided<00:04:55.510> face<00:04:59.100> and<00:05:00.720> then<00:05:01.720> both

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
have the double-sided face and then both

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.670 
have the double-sided face and then both
do<00:05:02.290> come<00:05:02.530> with<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.980> longbow<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.620> there's<00:05:05.620> a
