00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 is a girl when I went to the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.220
 cosmoprof I had shown some 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.250
 enamels of a line called ibi 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.889
 impression beauty international here it is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.279
 here is not a brand that I think is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 sells in Italy so I'm not going to get me 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 advertising let's say because I don't think so 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.369
 may find evening in the united states 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.310
 therefore at most it may be of interest if a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.779
 some of you go to the states and see 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 this brand may be condemned but 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.160
 cinema spoke wings and was it will be 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 bit still because if they don't ruin me too 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 and it was practically this enamel here 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 that when I hadn't shown I have 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.840
 made videos in which I had worn it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 in so many you have asked but how nice 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 that nail polish is that it can polish these 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.010
 enamels therefore seeing that today is the day of 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.920
 Easter still a half hour before 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 go I thought about putting on the nail polish 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.859
 to show you the three steps and to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 talk to you about this line because though 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.219
 here you do not find precisely and I am 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 I found the overhang very good for me 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.560
 very little because the first 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 bad habit to nibble if not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 nail the corners of the nails and then 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.750
 then jump quickly enough and then between 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 cat wash hair dishwasher not me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 never lasts so here then there is also from 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 to say that I am very very much 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 lazy I never put the basics in top coats 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 so you can understand those chanel the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.799
 the next day they skip this me 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 it had lasted almost a perfect week 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 for me it is already a success 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 but I won my laziness and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.540
 used both the base and the top coat 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.579
 so I'll show you all three 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.079
 friendly products and rights are found 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.750
 well so it's a video more than anything else of 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.280
 this is the top coat chat 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 here it is pictures for ultragrip bail out 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.780
 then I put this enamel here whose 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 color e 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:02.220
 bronze here it is and this is it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.180
 nail polish and then I also put a big party 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.819
 the top coat shine'm already yesterday 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.350
 using all three products first 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 because precisely I was curious to see if 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 the enamel lasted me a little longer 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.580
 and then why the girl at the stand where 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.760
 we had seen these enamels had us 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.250
 having said that base and touch are then theirs 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.519
 leading products is that their customers 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.310
 regulars call you super bass and super 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.220
 top then if the Americans call it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.800
 super those on touch you do work 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.660
 and I put both the house and my touch enough 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.209
 this is the enamel given that the watts e 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.950
 curious less you see which and I have to tell you 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.410
 the truth this hand that omitted it first 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.470
 and the omitted five minutes that is 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.510
 really already dry because one thing 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.920
 hateful of the smart that afterwards you do 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.150
 so and the whole course of the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.530
 fingertip 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.720
 here on this I don't do it because I was 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.329
 really finished a second ago but of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.160
 which I can really say is already 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.489
 dry so it works very much 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.170
 well 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.880
 here I do not do it 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.769
 because the enamel I just put it not 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.610
 the three minutes have gone by 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:15.420
 had said that three minutes and dry 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:18.420
 enough to rosi spot obviously I do not have 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.709
 nor taken medicine in nothingness because I 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.180
 they are miss laziness we start with the base 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.940
 it's called the grip and yoox group bay scott 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:37.590
 it has a milky consistency, let's say 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.920
 and that is what the base I do not have 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.410
 particularly this leveled nails 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.660
 let us say however with the fact that 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.600
 nibbles are not either 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.580
 super hyper homogeneous then this base 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.100
 milky that also pretty crafted by 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.340
 alone in my opinion if one of the beautiful 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:02.800
 nails is not my case it will make us for 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.290
 point from base for the enamel we say that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.110
 I should of course remove the skin 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.860
 things but I never face are here from 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.860
 lazy lazy tiger waiting for a minute 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.030
 ok now we're going to apply the color 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:27.100
 real the big in black the color 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:32.500
 that I have and in bronze you do not see it 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.230
 but here there is written bronze we go with the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.020
 first pass that if you don't have too much 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.220
 weather is already pretty enough even from 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.220
 let's just say 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.320
 however the base seems to me already dry 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.320
 after a nanosecond 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.320
 we continue with the second pass 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.060
 the color is really very nice 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.610
 this point I wait for another minute e 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.170
 then I'll go to put the top coat already yen 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.290
 shine fast trade show you won't stop 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.180
 coutts and I expect a minutino that is created 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.280
 a nonsense because this will help me 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.230
 to make the enamel dry more 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.760
 in a hurry, however, I am afraid it will be stained 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.090
 the small brush inside then I wait 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:54.140
 just a moment before passing it on 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.960
 ok at this point I'm going to put the top 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.290
 coat 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.290
 here it is 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.360
 three minutes and it's dry bye
