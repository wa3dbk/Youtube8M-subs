00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello people here max keizer 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 today find themselves for a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 new video for episodes 12 of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.949
 guide of gta 5 days we will 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 find are only for you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.470
 shows where is the helicos of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.599
 help so for the hospital etc etc etc 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.670
 potting soil and after just show you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 the different ambulance that has the same 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.719
 hospital where there are the helicopters so much 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 take advantage of it wholesale for the position of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.860
 the helicopter and ambulances but more 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 mainly helicopter and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.719
 two-way helicopters see her on 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 the map m then it's very simple 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.120
 you have going back to scale 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.420
 for half an hour because that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 do not move forward so the helicopters are pretty 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 friendly - are hostile and I believe that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.840
 this font tonight but it's not the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.039
 armed helicopters what is it for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.289
 carry people I do not confuse the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.820
 4 in I think it's small 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.409
 the advantage when we will see come night 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.489
 I do not know why when I came to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.930
 every time we get in the way and the day we 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 visited in late service they were 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.040
 busy just flying in the city 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.479
 because at night I found them at 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 every time we say the day j 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 did not come from where was the night from 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.670
 preference for having entered for the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.189
 ambulances and very simple unlike 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.990
 to the firefighters who when you get back into 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.250
 the ambulance finally as soon as you break the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.750
 window of the 15th time country they come 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 you type did not know how to take it 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.259
 here the ambulances and very simple the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 genius so the three different aligned 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.829
 in addition there are yellows anyway 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.360
 I took one and that's it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.579
 shows that here guys who drive 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 atmosphere they do not care that you 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.130
 leave with the ambulance saved 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 belonged to the wheel drive ahead so 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880
 it's a little too late for erdf 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.890
 now there they have bad 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.509
 it's a bit late guys so it's a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.590
 a little easier it's nice to have a 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.469
 ambulance because I think we can 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.080
 put the light needed and all that 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.030
 and make the noise 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.770
 and that's nice as with the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 police cars going on this month 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.040
 I hope it will be safer for you 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.610
 the diapers an often student idiot 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.410
 My facebook

 machaie do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.870

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.870
 rugby
