00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
with a normal server jar when it just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.679 
with a normal server jar when it just
extracts<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> actually<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.689> accessible

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
extracts this is actually not accessible

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.060 
extracts this is actually not accessible
by<00:01:06.960> bucket<00:01:07.350> yet<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> guys<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.979> what

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
by bucket yet if you guys know what

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
by bucket yet if you guys know what
bucket<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.560> minecraft<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bucket is it's the minecraft more the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.649 
bucket is it's the minecraft more the
modded<00:01:11.520> minecraft<00:01:11.700> servers<00:01:13.670> basically<00:01:14.670> what

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
modded minecraft servers basically what

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.179 
modded minecraft servers basically what
most<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> servers<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.500> put<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> bucket

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
most of the servers have put on bucket

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
most of the servers have put on bucket
just<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.000> stall<00:01:18.270> plugins<00:01:18.810> like

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
just so they can stall plugins like

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.469 
just so they can stall plugins like
single<00:01:19.380> player<00:01:19.560> commands<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.369> those<00:01:20.549> put

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
single player commands and all those put

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
single player commands and all those put
them<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> multiplayer<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.619> definitely

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
them to multiplayer but this definitely

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.609 
them to multiplayer but this definitely
doesn't<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.930> bad

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doesn't do it like that what one bad

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
doesn't do it like that what one bad
thing<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> have

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
thing about this is you're going to have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
thing about this is you're going to have
to<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.350> self<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.189> everyone<00:01:29.549> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to up your self and up everyone that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
to up your self and up everyone that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
join so they can actually destroy blocks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
join so they can actually destroy blocks
and<00:01:32.150> start<00:01:33.150> building<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> can't

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and start building because you can't

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
and start building because you can't
actually<00:01:34.229> destroy<00:01:34.619> boxes<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> might<00:01:35.340> see

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

thing about this new servers out jar is
that<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.619> makes<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> RAM<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that it actually makes the RAM in the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.530 
that it actually makes the RAM in the
server<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:47.070> certain<00:01:47.700> size<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.149> I'll<00:01:48.299> show<00:01:48.329> you

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.250 
here we'll have the four or however far
you<00:03:27.489> are<00:03:27.760> from<00:03:27.790> away<00:03:28.030> from<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.269> server<00:03:28.480> I'm<00:03:28.780> 16

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you are from away from the server I'm 16

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.140 
you are from away from the server I'm 16
milliseconds<00:03:29.560> which<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.130> extremely<00:03:30.700> fast

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
milliseconds which is extremely fast

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.930 
milliseconds which is extremely fast
because<00:03:31.420> i'm<00:03:31.540> actually<00:03:32.049> on<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.440> server<00:03:32.940> on

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
because i'm actually on this server on

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.060 
because i'm actually on this server on
my<00:03:34.120> computer<00:03:34.630> what<00:03:35.620> we're<00:03:35.739> going<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:35.920> want<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
my computer what we're going to want to

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.039 
my computer what we're going to want to
do<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.310> double<00:03:36.549> click<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.870> will

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
do is double click on that and that will

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.840 
do is double click on that and that will
actually<00:03:38.290> log<00:03:38.680> us<00:03:38.860> into<00:03:39.160> our<00:03:39.190> server<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.730> as

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
actually log us into our server and as

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.750 
actually log us into our server and as
you<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.150> see<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.829> will<00:03:41.890> take<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.280> bit<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.489> load

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
you can see this will take a bit to load

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.180 
you can see this will take a bit to load
because<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:43.570> buggy<00:03:44.140> development<00:03:44.920> and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
because this is in buggy development and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.289 
because this is in buggy development and
this<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.180> actually<00:03:46.390> lying<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.530> bit<00:03:47.739> but<00:03:48.730> don't

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
this is actually lying a bit but don't

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.229 
this is actually lying a bit but don't
worry<00:03:49.600> about<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.790> basically<00:03:52.120> just

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
worry about that this is basically just

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.729 
worry about that this is basically just
a<00:03:52.450> test<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.780> show<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.019> guys<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.380> does<00:03:53.560> actually

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
a test to show you guys it does actually

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.599 
a test to show you guys it does actually
work<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.579> can<00:03:55.570> type<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.079> text<00:03:56.430> blah<00:03:57.430> blah<00:03:57.579> blah

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
work I can type in text blah blah blah

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.440 
work I can type in text blah blah blah
so<00:03:58.480> um<00:03:58.780> right<00:03:59.590> now<00:03:59.769> we'll<00:04:00.549> see<00:04:00.700> okay<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.120> is

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
so um right now we'll see okay this is

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.750 
so um right now we'll see okay this is
where<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> part<00:04:01.900> becomes<00:04:02.530> annoying<00:04:02.829> we<00:04:03.549> can't

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
where the part becomes annoying we can't

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.780 
where the part becomes annoying we can't
actually<00:04:04.060> break<00:04:04.540> blocks<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.829> if<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.459> go<00:04:06.489> back

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
actually break blocks but if I go back

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.199 
actually break blocks but if I go back
and<00:04:07.000> edit<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.570> go<00:04:07.989> into<00:04:08.140> heal<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.829> in<00:04:09.579> here<00:04:09.970> I

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
and edit and go into heal and in here I

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.120 
and edit and go into heal and in here I
can<00:04:10.540> go<00:04:10.750> up<00:04:11.850> x5<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:14.620> will<00:04:14.799> actually<00:04:14.890> make

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
can go up x5 and this will actually make

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.580 
can go up x5 and this will actually make
me<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> opposite<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:15.970> see<00:04:16.239> from<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.200> console

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
me the opposite can see from the console

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.430 
me the opposite can see from the console
arm<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:19.359> will<00:04:19.510> make<00:04:19.630> me<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.019> now<00:04:20.169> I<00:04:20.200> can

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
arm it will make me and now I can

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.930 
arm it will make me and now I can
actually<00:04:20.530> break<00:04:20.859> blocks<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.519> have<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.820> do

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
actually break blocks and you have to do

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.839 
actually break blocks and you have to do
is<00:04:22.030> for<00:04:22.150> every<00:04:22.390> one<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.570> your<00:04:22.690> friends<00:04:23.849> that

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
they can actually break blocks this

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.150 
they can actually break blocks this
cannot<00:04:31.900> be<00:04:31.960> changed<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.680> it's<00:04:32.860> not<00:04:33.040> like

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.990 
microwave it on point it and that will
be<00:05:06.280> run<00:05:06.729> server<00:05:07.860> dot<00:05:08.860> dat<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.260> then<00:05:11.260> all<00:05:11.620> files

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
be run server dot dat and then all files

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.820 
be run server dot dat and then all files
so<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:15.240> that's<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.479> there<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:17.470> will<00:05:17.620> actually

so so that's it there that will actually

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.420 
so so that's it there that will actually
run<00:05:18.190> your<00:05:18.430> server<00:05:18.729> much<00:05:19.330> faster<00:05:19.900> um<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:21.340> will

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
run your server much faster um that will

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.770 
run your server much faster um that will
see<00:05:21.580> all<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.760> actually<00:05:21.910> pull<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.450> up<00:05:22.479> and

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
see all that actually pull that up and

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.230 
see all that actually pull that up and
that<00:05:23.740> will<00:05:23.830> be<00:05:24.039> able<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.250> run<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.580> if<00:05:24.910> you

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
that will be able to run that if you

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.629 
that will be able to run that if you
do--if<00:05:25.389> you<00:05:25.539> don't<00:05:25.930> have<00:05:26.229> that<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.800> don't

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
do--if you don't have that you don't

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.310 
do--if you don't have that you don't
need<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:27.940> anymore<00:05:28.000> because<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:29.139> will<00:05:29.260> just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
need that anymore because that will just

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.570 
need that anymore because that will just
be<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:29.889> I'm<00:05:29.949> just<00:05:29.979> going<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.220> stop<00:05:30.430> the

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
be this so I'm just going to stop the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.690 
be this so I'm just going to stop the
server<00:05:30.900> now<00:05:31.900> I'm<00:05:32.050> type<00:05:32.289> install<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.889> this<00:05:33.430> run

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
server now I'm type install and this run

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.340 
server now I'm type install and this run
serve<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.090> up<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.450> is<00:05:34.660> going<00:05:34.720> to<00:05:34.900> start<00:05:35.169> the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
serve it up that is going to start the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.469 
serve it up that is going to start the
server<00:05:35.560> all<00:05:35.770> up<00:05:35.889> again<00:05:36.010> much<00:05:36.490> easier<00:05:36.520> as<00:05:37.030> you

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
server all up again much easier as you

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.210 
server all up again much easier as you
can<00:05:37.660> see<00:05:37.870> it's<00:05:38.169> just<00:05:38.320> rolling<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:38.860> all<00:05:39.010> up

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
can see it's just rolling it all up

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.300 
can see it's just rolling it all up
again<00:05:39.570> if<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.660> go<00:05:40.810> back<00:05:40.840> allow<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.740> access<00:05:42.190> to

again if I go back allow the access to
the<00:05:42.430> Java<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.940> definitely<00:05:43.510> need<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.870> do<00:05:43.960> that

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
the Java you definitely need to do that

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.760 
the Java you definitely need to do that
on<00:05:44.320> Windows<00:05:44.620> 7<00:05:44.979> it's<00:05:45.610> going<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:45.880> help<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.360> Java

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
on Windows 7 it's going to help the Java

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.010 
on Windows 7 it's going to help the Java
access<00:05:47.770> all<00:05:47.919> your<00:05:47.950> files<00:05:48.220> easier<00:05:48.669> and<00:05:48.880> it<00:05:49.870> will

access all your files easier and it will

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.250 
access all your files easier and it will

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
be much easier to connect three a while

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.740 
be much easier to connect three a while
through<00:05:53.740> your<00:05:53.860> internet<00:05:54.280> which<00:05:54.970> is<00:05:55.000> not<00:05:55.720> a

through your internet which is not a
problem<00:05:56.110> at<00:05:56.200> all<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.530> we're<00:05:56.620> just<00:05:56.650> going<00:05:56.830> to

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
problem at all so we're just going to

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.440 
problem at all so we're just going to
prepare<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.490> spawn<00:05:57.760> area<00:05:58.030> or<00:05:58.389> again<00:05:59.430> as<00:06:00.450> you

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
prepare the spawn area or again as you

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.110

can<00:06:01.539> see<00:06:01.720> i'm<00:06:01.840> disconnected<00:06:02.320> from<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.560> server

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
can see i'm disconnected from the server

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.969 
can see i'm disconnected from the server
so<00:06:04.120> it's<00:06:04.360> done<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:04.900> only<00:06:05.620> go<00:06:05.740> back

this<00:06:43.479> game<00:06:43.870> mode<00:06:44.140> this<00:06:44.890> it<00:06:45.159> will<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.900> that<00:06:46.930> will

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
this game mode this it will so that will

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.040 
this game mode this it will so that will
actually<00:06:47.440> save<00:06:47.890> as<00:06:48.450> 0<00:06:49.450> which<00:06:49.750> is<00:06:49.870> actually

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
actually save as 0 which is actually

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.450 
actually save as 0 which is actually
survival<00:06:50.710> mode<00:06:50.860> and<00:06:51.130> you<00:06:51.219> know<00:06:51.310> their

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
survival mode and you know their

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.469 
survival mode and you know their
