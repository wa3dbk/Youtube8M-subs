00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that's what it looks like so without

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.929 
that's what it looks like so without
further<00:00:22.769> ado<00:00:23.160> let's<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.519> ahead<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.789> into

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
further ado let's go ahead and get into

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:34.669 
further ado let's go ahead and get into
it<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.439> show<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> bad<00:00:25.859> boy

so where can you find this you can
pretty<00:00:37.149> much<00:00:37.239> find<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.930> hollow<00:00:38.140> sites

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
pretty much find the hollow sites

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.729 
pretty much find the hollow sites
wherever<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.309> believe<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:40.510> know<00:00:41.079> it's<00:00:41.289> not<00:00:41.440> that

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
wherever I believe I know it's not that

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
rare to find it I mean why would it be

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.270 
rare to find it I mean why would it be

holographic<00:01:14.979> sight<00:01:15.190> with<00:01:15.899> zeroing<00:01:17.700> suitable

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
holographic sight with zeroing suitable

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.359 
holographic sight with zeroing suitable
for<00:01:18.970> crossbows<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:19.960> yes<00:01:20.289> it<00:01:20.560> does<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.920> 0<00:01:21.159> ring

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
for crossbows so yes it does have 0 ring

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.279 
for crossbows so yes it does have 0 ring
which<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:21.700> pretty<00:01:21.880> awesome<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:23.110> one

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
which is pretty awesome and that's one

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.480 
which is pretty awesome and that's one
of<00:01:23.319> the<00:01:23.409> best<00:01:23.560> things<00:01:23.770> about<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.159> which<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.369> will

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
of the best things about it which I will

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.570 
of the best things about it which I will
show<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.700> later<00:01:24.959> but<00:01:25.959> to<00:01:26.619> get<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.920> ziering<00:01:27.399> I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
show you later but to get that ziering I

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.270 
show you later but to get that ziering I
believe<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.149> do<00:01:28.360> need<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.630> battery<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:29.590> go

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
believe you do need a battery so go

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.219 
believe you do need a battery so go
ahead<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.520> attach<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.479> battery<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.110> I

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
ahead and attach a battery to it I

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.990 
ahead and attach a battery to it I
happen<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.799> have<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.310> battery<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:33.789> actually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
happen to have a battery I actually

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.359 
happen to have a battery I actually
saved<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.600> when<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.780> first<00:01:34.990> spawn<00:01:35.319> so<00:01:35.679> for<00:01:36.280> this

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369

there and same for the 50 and 70 so it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.979 
there and same for the 50 and 70 so it's
actually<00:02:12.340> very<00:02:12.370> very<00:02:12.640> helpful<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.540> long<00:02:13.959> as

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
actually very very helpful as long as

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.990 
actually very very helpful as long as
you<00:02:14.200> know<00:02:14.379> how<00:02:14.410> far<00:02:15.010> away<00:02:15.099> your<00:02:15.519> target<00:02:15.879> is

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you know how far away your target is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.820 
you know how far away your target is
which<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.659> sometimes<00:02:16.959> hard<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> do

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
which is sometimes hard to do

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
which is sometimes hard to do
unfortunately<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.569> makes<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> lot

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
unfortunately but it makes it a lot

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.660 
unfortunately but it makes it a lot
easier<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.920> instead<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
easier with this instead of just the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.820 
easier with this instead of just the
regular<00:02:22.000> iron<00:02:22.180> sights<00:02:22.540> which<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.470> kind<00:02:23.739> of

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
regular iron sights which it kind of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.589 
regular iron sights which it kind of
makes<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.159> enjoyable<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.849> use<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> crossbow

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
makes it enjoyable to use the crossbow

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.690 
makes it enjoyable to use the crossbow
with<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.959> way<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.409> this<00:02:26.560> holo<00:02:27.159> sight<00:02:27.459> even

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
with this way with this holo sight even

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.729 
with this way with this holo sight even
though<00:02:27.909> it's<00:02:28.090> still<00:02:28.300> weak<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.840> still<00:02:29.349> takes<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
though it's still weak it still takes a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.710 
though it's still weak it still takes a
couple<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.040> bows<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.459> kill<00:02:30.640> somebody<00:02:30.879> unless

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
couple of bows to kill somebody unless

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.970 
couple of bows to kill somebody unless
you<00:02:31.900> shoot<00:02:32.080> them<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.290> head<00:02:32.349> actually<00:02:32.920> I'm

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.380 
you shoot them in the head actually I'm
not<00:02:33.069> sure<00:02:33.129> about<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.730> if<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.060> shoot<00:02:34.180> them<00:02:34.330> in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
not sure about that if you shoot them in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.119 
not sure about that if you shoot them in
the<00:02:34.420> head<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.870> one<00:02:35.019> shot<00:02:35.319> let<00:02:35.830> me<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.010> in

but now let's go ahead and get to some

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.630 
but now let's go ahead and get to some
target<00:02:40.770> practice<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.250> shoot<00:02:41.430> some<00:02:41.610> zombies

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
target practice and shoot some zombies

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.420 
target practice and shoot some zombies
and<00:02:42.390> show<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.290> how<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> zeroing<00:02:44.010> actually

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and show you how to zeroing actually

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
and show you how to zeroing actually
works<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> went<00:02:45.990> up<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> chernaya<00:02:46.950> polana

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
works so I went up to chernaya polana

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.070 
works so I went up to chernaya polana
and<00:02:47.730> i<00:02:47.790> found<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.180> zombie<00:02:48.540> i<00:02:48.570> was<00:02:48.750> trying<00:02:49.020> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and i found a zombie i was trying to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.870 
and i found a zombie i was trying to
juke<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> make<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.160> stop<00:02:50.340> chasing<00:02:50.790> me

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
juke it out to make it stop chasing me

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880 
juke it out to make it stop chasing me
but<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.210> didn't<00:02:51.420> work<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:52.200> eventually

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
but that didn't work so I eventually

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
but that didn't work so I eventually
just<00:02:53.100> turned<00:02:53.760> around<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.180> ended<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.840> shooting

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
just turned around and ended up shooting

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.960 
just turned around and ended up shooting
it<00:02:55.350> which<00:02:55.500> kind<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.070> sucks<00:02:56.340> because<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.670> wanted

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
it which kind of sucks because I wanted

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.630 
it which kind of sucks because I wanted
it<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.330> stay<00:02:57.630> still<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.310> back<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.520> a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it to stay still so I can back up a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
it to stay still so I can back up a
little<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.120> test<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> different<00:03:00.690> meter

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
little bit and test the different meter

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.870 
little bit and test the different meter
ranges<00:03:01.740> one<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.910> zeroing<00:03:03.810> scope<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:05.190> just

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
ranges one the zeroing scope but I just

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.790 
ranges one the zeroing scope but I just
eventually<00:03:06.270> had<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.420> turn<00:03:06.630> around<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.290> kill

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
eventually had to turn around and kill

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.490 
eventually had to turn around and kill
it<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.520> did<00:03:08.670> take<00:03:08.880> two<00:03:09.030> shots

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
it and it did take two shots

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.960 
it and it did take two shots
unfortunately<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.680> wish<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.400> did<00:03:11.520> take<00:03:11.730> one

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
unfortunately I wish it did take one

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.610
