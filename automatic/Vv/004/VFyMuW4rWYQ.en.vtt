00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.070 
too late the scales at 260 pounds and
the<00:01:00.339> doc<00:01:00.519> told<00:01:00.760> me<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.210> if<00:01:01.330> I<00:01:01.510> wasn't<00:01:01.720> careful

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.590 
i'd need the knee joint surgery and that
was<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.620> bit<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.920> shock<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.760> really<00:01:10.390> thought

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
was a bit of a shock so I really thought

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.120 
was a bit of a shock so I really thought
I<00:01:10.780> better<00:01:11.080> do<00:01:11.260> something<00:01:11.620> about<00:01:11.740> this

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
I better do something about this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.859 
I better do something about this
and<00:01:13.399> I<00:01:14.240> spend<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.110> long<00:01:15.320> time<00:01:16.509> really<00:01:17.509> looking

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
and I spend a long time really looking

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.779 
and I spend a long time really looking
for<00:01:18.079> something<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:18.530> would<00:01:18.619> work<00:01:18.860> not<00:01:19.430> just<00:01:19.460> a

pounds pretty bad news huh and here's a
picture<00:02:05.539> later<00:02:06.159> after<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.250> put<00:02:07.610> myself<00:02:08.619> through

picture later after I put myself through

picture later after I put myself through
the<00:02:10.670> program<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.920> adopted<00:02:12.920> because<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:14.030> life

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the program and adopted because the life

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.330 
the program and adopted because the life
felt<00:02:14.510> was<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.019> right<00:02:15.260> way<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:16.130> go<00:02:16.160> about

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
felt was the right way to go about

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.309 
felt was the right way to go about
things<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.299> something<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.870> lasted

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
things and this is something that lasted

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.259 
things and this is something that lasted
because<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.680> picture<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.160> taken<00:02:22.370> two<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.239> a

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
because this picture is taken two and a

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.930 
because this picture is taken two and a
half<00:02:23.420> years<00:02:23.750> later

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
half years later

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.690 
half years later
so<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.750> goes<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.170> show<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.980> not<00:02:27.130> only<00:02:27.250> did<00:02:27.550> I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
so it goes to show and not only did I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.350 
so it goes to show and not only did I
lose<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.120> weight<00:02:28.320> but<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.350> kept<00:02:29.710> it<00:02:29.890> off<00:02:30.360> that's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
lose the weight but I kept it off that's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390 
lose the weight but I kept it off that's
something<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:31.990> thirty<00:02:32.410> percent<00:02:32.890> loss<00:02:33.100> of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
something like a thirty percent loss of

worked<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:54.140> also<00:03:54.980> built<00:03:55.400> myself<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.850> website

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
worked and I also built myself a website

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.300 
worked and I also built myself a website
so<00:03:57.770> i<00:03:57.800> could<00:03:58.130> show<00:03:58.430> other<00:03:58.970> people<00:03:59.270> how<00:03:59.980> i<00:04:00.980> had

so i could show other people how i had
achieved<00:04:01.460> it<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.810> maybe<00:04:03.050> they<00:04:03.440> could<00:04:03.650> follow

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
achieved it so maybe they could follow

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.090 
achieved it so maybe they could follow
in<00:04:04.070> my<00:04:04.220> footsteps<00:04:04.430> i<00:04:05.230> also<00:04:06.230> put<00:04:06.590> together<00:04:06.980> a

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
about the transformation remember i went

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.050 
about the transformation remember i went
from<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:23.320> i<00:05:23.760> managed<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:24.820> keep

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
from that to that and i managed to keep

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.720 
from that to that and i managed to keep
that<00:05:25.270> weight<00:05:25.480> off<00:05:25.950> thirty<00:05:26.950> percent<00:05:27.370> weight

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
that weight off thirty percent weight

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.560 
that weight off thirty percent weight
loss<00:05:28.000> don't<00:05:28.390> need<00:05:28.480> percent<00:05:28.840> body<00:05:29.320> weight<00:05:29.680> drop

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
loss don't need percent body weight drop

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.590 
loss don't need percent body weight drop
and<00:05:31.570> i've<00:05:32.350> maintained<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.730> it's<00:05:34.330> really

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
and i've maintained it and it's really

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.410 
and i've maintained it and it's really
because<00:05:35.320> i<00:05:35.650> took<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.190> time<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.030> trouble

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
because i took the time and the trouble

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.400 
because i took the time and the trouble
to<00:05:38.110> find<00:05:38.320> out<00:05:38.620> what<00:05:39.520> really<00:05:39.790> made<00:05:40.150> my<00:05:41.140> body

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
tick and how to scientifically go about

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.160 
tick and how to scientifically go about
losing<00:05:47.500> weight<00:05:47.680> for<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.040> long<00:05:48.190> term<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.750> if

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
because it's not rocket science but you

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.370 
because it's not rocket science but you
do<00:06:06.250> need<00:06:06.460> to<00:06:07.060> sift<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:08.470> myths<00:06:08.770> from<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.640> facts
