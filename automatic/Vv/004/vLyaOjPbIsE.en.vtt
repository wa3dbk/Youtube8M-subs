absolute cavity in this so that it's
easier<00:01:08.560> for<00:01:08.590> us<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:08.950> stuff<00:01:09.430> anything<00:01:09.729> inside

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
easier for us to stuff anything inside

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.990 
easier for us to stuff anything inside
today<00:01:10.869> we<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.079> stuffing<00:01:11.320> this<00:01:11.650> with<00:01:11.799> eggs<00:01:12.040> so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
today we are stuffing this with eggs so

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.599 
today we are stuffing this with eggs so
here<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.450> go<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:14.320> tomato<00:01:14.710> cavity<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:15.369> ready

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
here you go the tomato cavity is ready

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.489 
here you go the tomato cavity is ready
but<00:01:15.939> if<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.270> have<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.539> make<00:01:16.719> this<00:01:16.929> stand<00:01:17.289> on

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
but if you have to make this stand on

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.149 
but if you have to make this stand on
something<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.520> also<00:01:18.729> have<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.359> trim<00:01:19.840> your<00:01:20.350> so

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
something you also have to trim your so

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.679 
something you also have to trim your so
again<00:01:21.490> use<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.819> knife<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:24.149> so<00:01:25.149> when<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.420> slice

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
again use a knife and so when you slice

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.489 
again use a knife and so when you slice
off<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.139> bottom<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.909> tomato<00:01:28.270> stands<00:01:28.840> easily

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
off the bottom the tomato stands easily

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.679 
off the bottom the tomato stands easily
onto<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.799> plate<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.579> that's<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:31.030> we'll<00:01:31.299> set<00:01:31.539> this

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
onto a plate so that's it we'll set this

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
onto a plate so that's it we'll set this
aside<00:01:31.749> we<00:01:32.469> need<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.859> use<00:01:33.009> some<00:01:33.369> ramekin<00:01:33.880> molds

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
aside we need to use some ramekin molds

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520 
aside we need to use some ramekin molds
these<00:01:36.130> molds<00:01:36.759> are<00:01:36.909> big<00:01:37.299> proofs<00:01:37.689> so<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.229> can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
these molds are big proofs so you can

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.219 
these molds are big proofs so you can
put<00:01:39.039> this<00:01:39.189> in<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.459> oven<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.990> also

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
put this in the oven and it also

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.980 
put this in the oven and it also
sustains<00:01:41.859> very<00:01:42.280> high<00:01:42.490> temperatures<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.689> this

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
sustains very high temperatures so this

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.959 
sustains very high temperatures so this
is<00:01:44.139> your<00:01:44.289> ramekin<00:01:44.709> mold<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.490> we'll<00:01:45.729> do

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
is your ramekin mold so what we'll do

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.929 
is your ramekin mold so what we'll do
first<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.659> we'll<00:01:46.869> put<00:01:47.170> some<00:01:47.499> capsicum<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
first is we'll put some capsicum in the

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.870 
first is we'll put some capsicum in the
ramekin<00:01:49.240> mold<00:01:49.569> okay<00:01:50.350> after<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.700> done

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
ramekin mold okay after we have done

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.249 
ramekin mold okay after we have done
this<00:01:52.149> we'll<00:01:53.049> sprinkle<00:01:53.350> some<00:01:53.829> salt<00:01:54.130> over<00:01:55.090> this

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.120 

and<00:01:59.259> we'll<00:01:59.649> sprinkle<00:02:00.100> some<00:02:00.520> pepper<00:02:00.759> as<00:02:01.090> well

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:15.190 

now<00:02:06.090> olive<00:02:07.049> oil

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.809 

after<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.420> take<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.780> tomato<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.650> place<00:02:19.520> it

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
after this take one tomato and place it

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.420 
after this take one tomato and place it
over<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.300> capsicum<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.530> begin<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.190> we

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
over the capsicum now to begin with we

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.730 
over the capsicum now to begin with we
have<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.700> first<00:02:22.970> separate<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.870> egg<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.530> for

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
have to first separate the egg so for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.270 
have to first separate the egg so for
that<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:26.330> break<00:02:26.569> an<00:02:26.750> egg<00:02:29.590> all<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.100> need

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
that you break an egg all that we need

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.690 
that you break an egg all that we need
is<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.520> egg<00:02:31.760> white<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.860> yolk<00:02:34.010> goes<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
is the egg white so the yolk goes in the

egg whites in the tomato cavity it's

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.130 
egg whites in the tomato cavity it's
time<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.930> bake<00:03:33.140> this<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:34.630> what<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.019> do

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
time to bake this and what we need to do

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.319 
time to bake this and what we need to do
now<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:36.769> put<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.459> oven<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
now is just put this in the oven the

oven is preheated at 180 degree Celsius

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.960 
oven is preheated at 180 degree Celsius
and<00:03:41.299> this<00:03:41.810> needs<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.320> bake<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:42.860> at<00:03:43.100> least<00:03:43.310> 15

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and this needs to bake for at least 15

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.680 
and this needs to bake for at least 15
minutes<00:03:45.220> ok<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.489> been<00:03:46.549> about<00:03:46.790> 15-20

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
minutes ok so it's been about 15-20

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.149
