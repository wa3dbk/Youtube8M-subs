00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.520 
to thinking are like there's a song
called<00:01:49.200> gno<00:01:50.160> with<00:01:51.000> stands<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.020> girls<00:01:52.410> night

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
called gno with stands for girls night

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
called gno with stands for girls night
out<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.150> really<00:01:54.360> fun

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
out and I think that's really fun

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.170 
out and I think that's really fun
because<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.520> know

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
because if you put it on when you know

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.520 
because if you put it on when you know
you<00:01:57.240> might<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.780> having<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.290> such<00:01:58.470> a

you might not be having you know such a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
you might not be having you know such a
