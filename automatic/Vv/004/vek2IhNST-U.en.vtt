00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
white meet it'll give the illusion that

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.109 
white meet it'll give the illusion that
the<00:01:17.900> angulation<00:01:18.380> isn't<00:01:18.890> correct<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:19.909> you

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
the angulation isn't correct but you

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.580 
the angulation isn't correct but you
always<00:01:20.299> want<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.630> cut<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.140> if<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.470> were

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
always want to cut it as if it were

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.819 
always want to cut it as if it were
correct<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.299> guy<00:01:23.540> he<00:01:24.200> doesn't<00:01:24.590> have<00:01:24.799> a

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
correct so this guy he doesn't have a

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.289 
correct so this guy he doesn't have a
lot<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.040> problem<00:01:25.400> with<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.090> give

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
lot of problem with that but if you give

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.480 
lot of problem with that but if you give
till<00:01:26.750> we<00:01:26.869> have<00:01:27.079> more<00:01:27.290> white<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:27.860> area<00:01:28.280> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
till we have more white in this area and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.340 
till we have more white in this area and
then<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.000> all<00:01:29.119> sudden<00:01:29.479> goes<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.810> black<00:01:29.990> your

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
then it all sudden goes to black your

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.800 
then it all sudden goes to black your
dogs<00:01:30.560> may<00:01:30.860> wound<00:01:31.159> up<00:01:31.310> looking<00:01:31.579> longer<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.150> body

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
dogs may wound up looking longer in body

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:46.560 
dogs may wound up looking longer in body
than<00:01:33.079> they<00:01:33.200> should<00:01:33.439> be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.330 

okay<00:01:47.570> now<00:01:47.750> my<00:01:47.990> under<00:01:48.320> line<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.500> actually<00:01:48.799> switch

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
okay now my under line I actually switch

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.300 
okay now my under line I actually switch
and<00:01:49.520> use<00:01:49.670> my<00:01:49.850> straight<00:01:50.720> shears<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:54.070> now<00:01:55.070> they

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and use my straight shears and now they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.520 
and use my straight shears and now they
have<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> lot<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.790> wave<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.299> their<00:01:56.420> coat<00:01:56.690> this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
have a lot of wave to their coat this

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.889 
have a lot of wave to their coat this
part<00:01:57.799> can<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:57.979> tricky<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> kind<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.330> wet<00:01:59.780> it

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
part can be tricky so I kind of I wet it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.539 
part can be tricky so I kind of I wet it
down<00:02:00.049> pretty<00:02:00.350> good<00:02:00.470> because<00:02:00.920> every<00:02:01.130> swipe<00:02:01.369> of

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
down pretty good because every swipe of

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.029 
down pretty good because every swipe of
the<00:02:01.610> comb<00:02:02.049> brings<00:02:03.049> your<00:02:03.229> static<00:02:03.590> right<00:02:03.770> back

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
the comb brings your static right back

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.999 
the comb brings your static right back
but<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:04.759> want<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.060> get<00:02:05.119> this<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.509> lie<00:02:05.689> as<00:02:06.020> nice

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
but I want to get this to lie as nice

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.520 
but I want to get this to lie as nice
and<00:02:07.189> straight<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:07.640> possible<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:09.050> also<00:02:09.200> want

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
I heavily conditioned this area just to

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770 
I heavily conditioned this area just to
kind<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.579> help<00:03:07.700> prevent<00:03:08.209> any<00:03:08.390> kind<00:03:08.720> of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
kind of help prevent any kind of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
kind of help prevent any kind of
breakage<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.320> maybe<00:03:09.530> coat<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.950> coat<00:03:10.100> a

breakage and maybe coat the coat a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.009 
breakage and maybe coat the coat a
little<00:03:10.340> bit<00:03:10.609> so<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.000> don't<00:03:11.180> urinate<00:03:11.870> all

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
little bit so they don't urinate all

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.289 
little bit so they don't urinate all
over<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.440> another<00:03:13.340> thing<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.730> don't<00:03:14.060> do

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299
