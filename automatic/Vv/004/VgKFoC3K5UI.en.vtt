this<00:01:36.060> means<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.930> air<00:01:37.110> pushes<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> cylinder

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
this means that air pushes the cylinder

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880 
this means that air pushes the cylinder
out<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.939> using<00:01:39.540> air<00:01:39.900> from<00:01:40.200> both<00:01:40.380> sides<00:01:40.710> of

the cylinder when air comes into this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.520 
the cylinder when air comes into this
side<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:44.220> forces<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.140> when<00:01:46.140> air<00:01:46.290> comes

side it forces it out when air comes
into<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.890> side<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.579> forces<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
into this side it forces it back in a
