00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
you do by contraction sets you'll still

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.020 
you do by contraction sets you'll still
have<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.890> pay<00:02:51.069> around<00:02:51.160> ten<00:02:51.430> fifteen<00:02:51.819> dollars

all<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.620> them<00:03:08.739> are<00:03:08.890> $35<00:03:09.549> or<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
all of them are $35 or more so this is a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
all of them are $35 or more so this is a
cheapest<00:03:10.930> way<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.049> get<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.440> as<00:03:11.680> well

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
cheapest way to get that as well

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220 
cheapest way to get that as well
and<00:03:12.940> one<00:03:13.090> last<00:03:13.239> look<00:03:13.450> at<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.690> vehicle<00:03:13.989> itself

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and one last look at the vehicle itself

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.990 
and one last look at the vehicle itself
kind<00:03:14.829> of<00:03:14.920> weird<00:03:15.099> how<00:03:15.250> they<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.579> these<00:03:15.730> little

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
kind of weird how they have these little

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
kind of weird how they have these little
wood<00:03:16.239> pieces<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.110> engines<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.769> doesn't

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
wood pieces as the engines that doesn't

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.470 
wood pieces as the engines that doesn't
make<00:03:18.340> too<00:03:18.489> much<00:03:18.609> sense<00:03:18.670> but<00:03:19.060> other<00:03:19.239> than<00:03:19.420> that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
make too much sense but other than that

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.270 
make too much sense but other than that
I<00:03:19.630> mean<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> very<00:03:20.049> cool-looking<00:03:20.590> vehicle

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
I mean it's a very cool-looking vehicle

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.009 
I mean it's a very cool-looking vehicle

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
especially for a polybag build and of

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.599 
especially for a polybag build and of

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
course you could just fit Sitecore on

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.710 
course you could just fit Sitecore on
there<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.569> wheel<00:03:25.690> it

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
there like that and you can wheel it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.710 
there like that and you can wheel it
around<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.850> nice<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.420> that's<00:03:28.569> it

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
build itself is not bad whatsoever it's

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.180 
build itself is not bad whatsoever it's
a<00:04:25.030> little<00:04:25.240> ice<00:04:25.419> cruiser<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.050> it<00:04:26.770> serves<00:04:27.010> its

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
a little ice cruiser and it serves its

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.670 
a little ice cruiser and it serves its
purpose

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
purpose

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.159 
purpose
polybag<00:04:28.070> build<00:04:28.340> quite<00:04:28.850> well<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.990> little

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
polybag build quite well it's a little

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.070 
polybag build quite well it's a little
bit<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.530> more<00:04:30.710> unconventional<00:04:30.889> build<00:04:32.080> but

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
bit of a more unconventional build but

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.510 
bit of a more unconventional build but
it's<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.590> guess<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.979> makes<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.250> little<00:04:34.430> bit

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
it's I guess that makes it a little bit

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.800 
it's I guess that makes it a little bit
more<00:04:34.699> unique<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.330> still<00:04:35.479> looks<00:04:35.509> pretty

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
more unique and it still looks pretty

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.689 
more unique and it still looks pretty
cool<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.919> can't<00:04:37.280> really<00:04:37.460> give<00:04:37.580> this

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699
