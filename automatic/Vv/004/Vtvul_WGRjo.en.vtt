owner number 7 yo mama hook and as you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
owner number 7 yo mama hook and as you
can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.920> there's<00:00:20.220> no<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.270> little

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
can see there's no I it's just a little

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
can see there's no I it's just a little
kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> flat<00:00:22.260> piece<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.740> end<00:00:22.949> there<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
kind of flat piece at the end there and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400 
kind of flat piece at the end there and
a<00:00:23.220> lot<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> people<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:24.300> questions<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.140> how

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a lot of people have questions about how

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
a lot of people have questions about how
exactly<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.279> attach<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.820> loop<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> that's

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
exactly to attach the loop and that's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.339 
exactly to attach the loop and that's
one<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> things<00:00:27.930> I'm<00:00:28.019> gonna<00:00:28.109> show<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
today in this video ok the first step is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.440 
today in this video ok the first step is
to<00:00:31.560> start<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.219> thread<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.210> start

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to start your thread and I like to start

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
to start your thread and I like to start
right<00:00:33.600> where<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> eye<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> wrap

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
right where the eye would be and wrap

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
right where the eye would be and wrap
back<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.899> bit<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.270> wrap

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
back just a little bit and then wrap

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.030 
back just a little bit and then wrap
forward<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> stop<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> thread<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
forward and stop the thread right at the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.959 
forward and stop the thread right at the
front<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> hook<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> next<00:00:50.520> step<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
front of the hook the next step is to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.130 
front of the hook the next step is to
make<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> loop<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> front<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> hook

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
make a loop on the front of the hook

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
make a loop on the front of the hook
that<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> attach<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.980> tip<00:00:53.129> Atun<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that you can attach your tip Atun and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
that you can attach your tip Atun and
for<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.850> I'll<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> using<00:00:54.239> silk<00:00:55.050> bead<00:00:55.350> cord

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
for that I'll be using silk bead cord

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
for that I'll be using silk bead cord

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
best size I've found for most Tim car

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
best size I've found for most Tim car
flies<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.890> first<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.270> loop

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
flies so first just make a little loop

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.380 
flies so first just make a little loop
like<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> pinch<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.670> put<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
like that and pinch it put it right on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
like that and pinch it put it right on
top<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> flat<00:01:16.140> piece<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.159> front<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
top of that flat piece on the front of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.969 
top of that flat piece on the front of
the<00:01:17.790> hook<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.189> just<00:01:20.189> start<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> tie<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.090> down

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
the hook and just start to tie it down

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.539 
the hook and just start to tie it down
and<00:01:22.979> slowly<00:01:23.549> wrap<00:01:23.909> backward<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.100> size<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and slowly wrap backward now the size of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
and slowly wrap backward now the size of
loop<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.630> anglers<00:01:28.049> tie<00:01:28.439> them

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
loop is up to you some anglers tie them

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
loop is up to you some anglers tie them
really<00:01:28.950> long<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.049> keep<00:01:31.170> them

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
really long and some kind of keep them

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
really long and some kind of keep them
short<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.670> mine

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
short go like that I kind of like mine

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
short go like that I kind of like mine
short<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.159> gonna<00:01:35.280> leave<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
short so I'm just gonna leave it like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.140 
short so I'm just gonna leave it like
that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
that
clip<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> excess<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.220> give

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
clip off the excess and then just give

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
clip off the excess and then just give
it<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> few<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:38.850> wraps<00:01:39.180> over<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> for

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it a few more wraps over that for

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
it a few more wraps over that for
strength<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> lot<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> people<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
strength now a lot of people have a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
strength now a lot of people have a
question<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:42.990> strong<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.920> will

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
question about how strong is this will

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
question about how strong is this will
it<00:01:44.399> pull<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.649> you're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it pull out and if you want if you're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
it pull out and if you want if you're
paranoid<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.700> always<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
paranoid about that you can always put a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
paranoid about that you can always put a
little<00:01:48.090> drop<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.570> superglue<00:01:48.960> or<00:01:49.380> cement<00:01:49.740> there

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
little drop of superglue or cement there

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
form a tapered body with the thread

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
form a tapered body with the thread
again<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.390> could<00:03:06.540> make<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> fur<00:03:07.440> body<00:03:07.769> or<00:03:08.750> use

again you could make a fur body or use

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.130 
again you could make a fur body or use
other<00:03:09.930> materials<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.799> body<00:03:11.900> it's<00:03:12.900> really

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
body like this you could add copper wire

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.180 
body like this you could add copper wire
as<00:03:17.850> ribbing<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.380> here<00:03:19.709> I'm<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:19.890> gonna<00:03:20.010> make

as ribbing but here I'm just gonna make
a<00:03:20.250> very<00:03:20.489> simple<00:03:20.940> thread<00:03:21.950> body<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.500> when<00:03:25.590> you

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
a very simple thread body and when you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.860 
a very simple thread body and when you
get<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.799> taper<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:27.750> go
