00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.350 

yeah<00:00:53.160> i'm<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.490> fast<00:00:53.700> forward<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.210> little

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
yeah i'm going to fast forward a little

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
yeah i'm going to fast forward a little
bit<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:58.080> fast<00:00:58.290> forwarding<00:00:58.650> is<00:00:58.800> quite

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
bit and see fast forwarding is quite

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:14.080 
bit and see fast forwarding is quite
quick<00:01:01.250> buffering<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> fast<00:01:03.210> too

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.400 

what<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> decent<00:01:15.600> I've<00:01:15.690> actually<00:01:15.870> scaled<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
what is decent I've actually scaled the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.650 
what is decent I've actually scaled the
screen<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.800> this<00:01:16.950> point<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:18.120> make<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> small<00:01:18.540> as

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
screen at this point to make it small as

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.420 
screen at this point to make it small as
possible<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> guess<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.370> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
possible it's about it I guess about a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
possible it's about it I guess about a
quarter<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.910> my<00:01:21.030> screen<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> purposes<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
quarter of my screen for the purposes of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
quarter of my screen for the purposes of
showing<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> player<00:01:23.550> but<00:01:24.180> he<00:01:24.330> also<00:01:24.600> has

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
showing you the player but he also has

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.700 
showing you the player but he also has
full<00:01:25.110> screen<00:01:25.380> support<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:25.950> well<00:01:30.530> I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.620> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
full screen support as well I'm going to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.290 
full screen support as well I'm going to
fast<00:01:32.100> forward<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.550> here<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> another<00:01:33.060> scene

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
fast forward a bit here to another scene

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.430 
fast forward a bit here to another scene
in<00:01:33.780> another<00:01:34.050> field<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
in another field for it and this is
