somebody who's trying to get into your

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.660 
somebody who's trying to get into your
gun<00:02:04.350> vaults<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:04.920> didn't<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> code

gun vaults and they didn't know the code

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.740 
gun vaults and they didn't know the code
after<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.630> 24<00:02:07.079> different<00:02:07.310> tries<00:02:08.750> it'll

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
after I think 24 different tries it'll

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
after I think 24 different tries it'll
automatically<00:02:10.170> lock<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> system<00:02:11.190> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
automatically lock out the system so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
automatically lock out the system so
then<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> go<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.120> reset<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
then you have to go in to reset it this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.199 
then you have to go in to reset it this
