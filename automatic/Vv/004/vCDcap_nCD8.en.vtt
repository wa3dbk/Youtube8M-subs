00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.400
 the participation of team coaches met 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.290

 she reacting your comment gender 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.770
 final match regular 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.690
 championship 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.880
 turn off Lena turned out to conclude not 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.060
 very much all our matches with salavat in 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.020
 this season and passed such an interesting 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.060
 the fight against heat who did not want to give 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.850
 so hate that by and large 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.260
 say and not say that much to me 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.910
 liked all those extra grams 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.390
 previous two games in the trip that we 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.450
 also lost but let's say there that 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.680
 the team there saw much more interesting but 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.890
 it is first of all exactly the same 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.900
 connected with the game of salavat which 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.700
 health moved and almost never 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.410
 oh and not allowed to do while 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.079
 made us wrong in defense and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.809
 deserved cite thank you separate 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.420
 throw today a good game was up game 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.460
 so close to the playoff match 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.430
 that only the team itself plays 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.320
 answer all 60 minutes 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 you scored further successful head 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 Generally it is good to work the whole match 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 I think it's very good for us even 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 before the last match there to choose 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.479
 won dates for us I have to him up 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 give a good dispensation positive 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.630
 emotions and yourself in general then we will now 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 prepare for a match fight 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.770
 thank you coaches please if your 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 Mentor questions do not forget 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.630
 submit a match question 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.509
 shores or sectors in newspaper bonus in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.070
 In general, today a lot of words of struggle were 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.950
 in the first period and now after the first 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.240
 translation somehow the heat has gone down all the same 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.840
 sharply installation was that more 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.470
 surrender to the game and less on emotions or 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.360
 they themselves have already realized that it is not 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 a colleague said what they started the attacks 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 held that all matches were held in 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.789
 the fight has always and always had a high heat 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.840
 corner of the screen consists of different moments 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.510
 good fun playing still question 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.380
 Timur Hilman sports in 11 readings easier 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.239
 played Siberia than on the road 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.049
 Well, yes, of course, and in this in this 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.880
 year of course 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.530
 The specificity of the calendar is very collecting 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.060
 we carry out the home team 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 brilliant home match and we have time 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.560
 got after Khabarovsk after 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.150
 I expect Vladivostok to eat of course 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.859
 no doubt these are the distortions of the calendar and 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
 certainly not affect all commands on 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.830
 different general this whole charmed all 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.950
 matches the same 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.300
 this we do not look at these things my need 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.460
 play then so that we have a coach 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.800
 treated either people sleep and where is Vladimir 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.870
 today in the composition was not to have in Groshev 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.060
 system this is what was known breathing whether 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.390
 what injuries 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.040
 pear we have at home make up something not 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.550
 recovered from injuries received 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.470
 composition of the team ultram this damage 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:18.560
 we did not use Vasiliev Russo 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:18.560
 so as not to aggravate another question 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.050
 and the evening for bashkortostan vladimir 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.980
 Vladimir became known that 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.840
 reigning champion you will have 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.230
 play repainting for no big 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:36.860
 comment became tired already known 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.270
 but eight this year teach high 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.190
 championship level is very high 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.960
 its in the eight is not generally weak 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.400
 I see therefore it was important to us 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.560
 spend well these last two 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 home games and who will be the opponent 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 as if you will be a secret to lunch hour 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.030

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.280

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.100
 she cities rivals are serving to this already 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.370
 ready therefore but here we will not be 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.370
