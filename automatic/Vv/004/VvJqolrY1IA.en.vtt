00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.400 
I've noticed these two new TV spots
they're<00:00:21.010> not<00:00:21.310> us<00:00:21.880> TV<00:00:22.240> spots<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:23.080> don't<00:00:23.260> know

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
they're not us TV spots I don't know

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.280 
they're not us TV spots I don't know
where<00:00:23.650> they<00:00:23.860> are<00:00:23.890> from<00:00:24.310> exactly<00:00:25.000> but<00:00:25.720> you<00:00:26.230> know

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
where they are from exactly but you know

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.530 
where they are from exactly but you know
it<00:00:26.380> also<00:00:26.590> shows<00:00:26.800> jun<00:00:27.040> 26th<00:00:27.759> and<00:00:28.270> it<00:00:28.360> says

it also shows jun 26th and it says

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.120 
it also shows jun 26th and it says
twenty<00:00:29.080> sixth<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.500> June<00:00:29.529> so<00:00:29.890> i'm<00:00:29.980> guessing

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
twenty sixth of June so i'm guessing

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.900 
twenty sixth of June so i'm guessing
europe<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.810> uh<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:33.160> let's<00:00:33.460> go<00:00:33.640> ahead<00:00:33.670> and

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
europe but uh so let's go ahead and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.180 
europe but uh so let's go ahead and
watch<00:00:34.360> this<00:00:34.810> and<00:00:35.140> hopefully<00:00:35.650> it's<00:00:35.829> a<00:00:35.980> little

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
watch this and hopefully it's a little

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.830 
watch this and hopefully it's a little
bit<00:00:36.310> more<00:00:36.460> slower<00:00:36.790> pace<00:00:37.090> on<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.420> last<00:00:37.630> one

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
bit more slower pace on that last one

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.930 
bit more slower pace on that last one
because<00:00:38.170> all<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.470> new<00:00:39.100> scenes<00:00:39.460> flashing

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
because all the new scenes flashing

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.070 
because all the new scenes flashing
everywhere<00:00:40.210> cream<00:00:40.540> until<00:00:40.690> what<00:00:40.960> was

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
everywhere cream until what was

and Tessa and they are talking Optimus

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.669 
and Tessa and they are talking Optimus
Prime<00:01:40.009> here<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:41.479> was<00:01:41.659> in<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:41.869> one<00:01:42.229> TVs

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
Prime here and that was in that one TVs

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.410 
Prime here and that was in that one TVs
now<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:42.979> trailer<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:43.909> think<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.210> was<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
now the trailer I think it was the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.840 
now the trailer I think it was the
Russian<00:01:44.719> trailer<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.259> said<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:46.159> am

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
Russian trailer that said like I am

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.059 
Russian trailer that said like I am
Optimus<00:01:47.270> crimes<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.350> where<00:01:48.829> they<00:01:49.039> are

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
Optimus crimes so that is where they are

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.690 
Optimus crimes so that is where they are
right<00:01:49.460> now<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:51.219> I'm<00:01:52.219> guessing<00:01:52.579> they're

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
right now and I'm guessing they're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.190 
right now and I'm guessing they're
meeting<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.149> Autobots<00:01:53.659> or<00:01:53.929> maybe<00:01:54.110> just

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
meeting the Autobots or maybe just

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.440 
meeting the Autobots or maybe just
Optimus<00:01:54.890> new<00:01:55.219> pumpkin<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:55.789> this<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.090> probably

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
Optimus new pumpkin but this is probably

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.139 
Optimus new pumpkin but this is probably
right<00:01:57.140> after<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.429> whole<00:01:58.610> battle<00:01:59.030> with

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
right after the whole battle with

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.660 
right after the whole battle with
lockdown<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.009> Galvatron<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.039> think<00:02:01.429> because

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
lockdown and Galvatron I think because

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.850 
lockdown and Galvatron I think because
I'm<00:02:01.909> getting<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.329> sense<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.840> maybe<00:02:03.319> Optimus

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
I'm getting the sense that maybe Optimus

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160 
I'm getting the sense that maybe Optimus
does<00:02:04.159> escape<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.030> battle<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.659> walk<00:02:06.140> down

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
does escape that battle and walk down

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.270 
does escape that battle and walk down
doesn't<00:02:06.649> capture<00:02:06.860> optimists<00:02:07.549> there<00:02:07.759> because

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
doesn't capture optimists there because

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.650 
doesn't capture optimists there because
especially<00:02:10.280> because<00:02:10.819> in<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.329> scene

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
especially because in that one scene

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.390 
especially because in that one scene
from<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> TV<00:02:12.079> spot<00:02:12.410> where<00:02:12.560> Shane<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:13.130> like

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
from the TV spot where Shane was like

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850 
from the TV spot where Shane was like
that<00:02:13.970> was<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.599> was<00:02:14.750> insane<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.680> was

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
that was that was insane that was

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.430 
that was that was insane that was
awesome<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.489> was<00:02:16.579> insane<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.599> does<00:02:18.110> kind

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
awesome but it was insane it does kind

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.319 
awesome but it was insane it does kind
of<00:02:18.500> look<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.739> they're<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:20.060> rusty<00:02:20.989> truck

wasn't<00:02:35.329> I'm<00:02:35.630> not<00:02:35.750> actually<00:02:35.900> sure<00:02:36.139> about<00:02:36.530> that

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
wasn't I'm not actually sure about that

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.949 
wasn't I'm not actually sure about that
but<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.760> think<00:02:38.000> maybe<00:02:38.150> they're<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.660> Western

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
but I think maybe they're in the Western

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.140 
but I think maybe they're in the Western
Star<00:02:39.139> truck<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:39.709> they<00:02:39.889> did<00:02:40.069> escape<00:02:40.430> so

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
Star truck and maybe they did escape so

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.080 
Star truck and maybe they did escape so
but<00:02:41.600> who<00:02:41.900> knows<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:43.549> I'm<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:43.850> not<00:02:44.000> even

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
but who knows and I'm really not even

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.250 
but who knows and I'm really not even
paying<00:02:44.269> attention<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> clothings

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
paying attention to the clothings

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.780 
paying attention to the clothings
because<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.889> would<00:02:46.010> make<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> big<00:02:46.430> sense<00:02:46.670> in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
because that would make a big sense in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.610 
because that would make a big sense in
that<00:02:46.850> too<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.239> don't<00:02:47.420> know<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:47.750> early<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that too I don't know it's early and I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.500 
that too I don't know it's early and I
am<00:02:48.829> trying<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.880> formulate<00:02:50.299> ideas<00:02:51.639> but<00:02:52.639> um<00:02:52.850> so

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
am trying to formulate ideas but um so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
teaser trailer but apparently at this

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
teaser trailer but apparently at this
point<00:04:19.229> he<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> talking<00:04:19.979> about<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.459> crime<00:04:20.729> he

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060

and he is transformed and talking to him

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.890 
and he is transformed and talking to him
so<00:04:27.090> that's<00:04:27.240> going<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.419> be<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> really<00:04:27.750> cool

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
so that's going to be a really cool

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.620 
so that's going to be a really cool
interaction<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.820> means<00:04:30.000> we'll<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.330> more

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
movie I feel like it's going to be a lot

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300 
movie I feel like it's going to be a lot
better<00:04:59.420> than<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.380> original<00:05:00.440> trilogy<00:05:00.950> because

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
better than the original trilogy because

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.120 
better than the original trilogy because
I<00:05:01.520> think<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.820> going<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.970> be<00:05:02.030> more<00:05:02.330> emotional
