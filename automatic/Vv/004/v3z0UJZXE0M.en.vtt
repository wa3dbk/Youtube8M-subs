$1000<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.110> you're<00:03:17.680> wondering<00:03:17.980> what<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
$1000 if you're wondering what the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.590 
$1000 if you're wondering what the
surface<00:03:18.489> pro<00:03:18.670> 3<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.940> going<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> start<00:03:19.420> at

surface pro 3 is going to start at

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.590 
surface pro 3 is going to start at
that's<00:03:20.110> about<00:03:20.290> $800<00:03:20.950> for<00:03:21.160> ni3<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
that's about $800 for ni3 so the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.530 
that's about $800 for ni3 so the
question<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.700> good<00:03:24.940> value<00:03:25.209> that's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
question is is this a good value that's

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.479 
question is is this a good value that's
going<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.750> depend<00:03:26.020> really<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.340> what
