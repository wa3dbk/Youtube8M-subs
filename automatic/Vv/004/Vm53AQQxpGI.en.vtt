00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is disinfectant I believe is that's the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
is disinfectant I believe is that's the
one<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.699> top<00:01:10.909> there<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.150> make<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
one right up top there we go make a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.190 
one right up top there we go make a
little<00:01:12.960> hole<00:01:13.460> adult<00:01:14.460> supervision

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.880 

okay<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> first<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:22.009> what<00:01:23.009> Reagan<00:01:24.890> its
