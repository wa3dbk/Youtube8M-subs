many<00:00:26.580> good<00:00:26.789> six<00:00:27.119> 500<00:00:27.599> turbos<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.380> could<00:00:28.650> be

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
many good six 500 turbos it could be

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.769 
many good six 500 turbos it could be
because<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.340> were<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.240> greatest<00:00:30.269> bike

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
because they were not the greatest bike

quickly through that you can see so the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
quickly through that you can see so the
front<00:00:36.930> forks<00:00:37.469> where<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> leaky<00:00:38.460> seals<00:00:38.760> I've

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
front forks where the leaky seals I've

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
front forks where the leaky seals I've
taken<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> forks<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.309> taking<00:00:41.309> apart<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
taken the forks out and taking apart and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
taken the forks out and taking apart and
put<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.690> had<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> fork<00:00:43.110> legs<00:00:43.320> painted

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
put actually had the fork legs painted

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
put actually had the fork legs painted
again<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.489> looking<00:00:44.579> brand<00:00:44.969> new<00:00:45.120> got

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
again so they're looking brand new got

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
again so they're looking brand new got
the<00:00:45.570> track<00:00:46.170> decals<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> whatnot<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:47.460> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the track decals and whatnot to put on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.310 
the track decals and whatnot to put on
there<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> front<00:00:48.629> calipers<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.170> been

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
there and the front calipers have been

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160 
there and the front calipers have been
repainted<00:00:50.010> again<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.090> front<00:00:51.300> wheel<00:00:51.539> it's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
repainted again the front wheel it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
repainted again the front wheel it's
typical<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> con<00:00:53.489> start<00:00:53.789> gold<00:00:54.030> they're

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
typical of the con start gold they're

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
typical of the con start gold they're
not<00:00:54.360> unless<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> brand<00:00:55.440> new<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.649> will

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
not unless you get a brand new one will

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
not unless you get a brand new one will
you<00:00:56.190> look<00:00:56.309> after<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.469> newborn<00:00:58.469> they

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you look after them like a newborn they

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400 
you look after them like a newborn they
tend<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> give<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.239> ready<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.629> anyhow<00:01:00.899> these

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
tend to give it ready but anyhow these

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
tend to give it ready but anyhow these
covers<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.180> stone<00:01:03.449> chips<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
covers because they get stone chips and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530 
covers because they get stone chips and
whatnot<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.189> pretty<00:01:05.519> messed<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
whatnot they get pretty messed up and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
whatnot they get pretty messed up and
these<00:01:06.659> were<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:06.869> corroded<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.830> rubbished

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
these were all corroded and rubbished

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.850 
these were all corroded and rubbished
and<00:01:08.490> completely<00:01:09.090> crap<00:01:09.420> old<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.710> we've

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and completely crap old so what we've

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
and completely crap old so what we've
done<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.100> I've<00:01:11.430> taken<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.330> them

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
done is I've taken them off and had them

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.109 
done is I've taken them off and had them
refinished<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.080> real<00:01:13.650> clear<00:01:13.890> coated<00:01:14.310> also

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
refinished and real clear coated also

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.690 
refinished and real clear coated also
the<00:01:15.509> oil<00:01:16.409> filter<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.860> well<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.189> filter<00:01:17.520> cover

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the oil filter as well or filter cover

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.310 
the oil filter as well or filter cover
the<00:01:18.540> example<00:01:18.960> completely<00:01:21.080> repainted<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the example completely repainted the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
the example completely repainted the
entire<00:01:22.680> exhaust<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.430> masked<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.210> everything

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
entire exhaust and masked and everything

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
entire exhaust and masked and everything
around<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.900> turbo<00:01:25.290> sign<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.009> then

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
around the turbo sign here and then

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
around the turbo sign here and then
polished<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.479> probably<00:01:27.780> better

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
polished it up so it's probably better

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
polished it up so it's probably better
than<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> came<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.860> standard<00:01:29.280> actually<00:01:29.610> all

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
than it came out standard actually all

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
than it came out standard actually all
these<00:01:30.360> alloy<00:01:30.600> pieces<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.409> been

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
these alloy pieces here have been

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 
these alloy pieces here have been
polished<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.700> one's<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.000> cool<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
polished this one's very cool you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
polished this one's very cool you
probably<00:01:33.869> dig<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.590> cap<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.220> all

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
probably dig this this cap here was all

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.190 
probably dig this this cap here was all
corroded<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.060> rubbished<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.079> they

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
corroded and rubbished out like they

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.999 
corroded and rubbished out like they
always<00:01:37.350> are

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
always are

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
always are
so<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> naught<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.869> all

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so that's come off in the naught has all
