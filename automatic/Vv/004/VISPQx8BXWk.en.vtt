I've<00:02:30.780> been<00:02:31.110> walking<00:02:31.520> hanging<00:02:32.520> out<00:02:32.640> with<00:02:32.790> my

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
I've been walking hanging out with my

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.850 
I've been walking hanging out with my

last few days plus it's been nice um so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.570 
last few days plus it's been nice um so
yeah<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.280> decided<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.180> maybe<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.600> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.580> slow

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
yeah I decided that maybe I need to slow

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.470 
yeah I decided that maybe I need to slow
down<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:42.209> little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.019> let<00:02:44.010> my<00:02:44.160> body<00:02:44.480> recover

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
down a little bit I let my body recover

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.410 
down a little bit I let my body recover
or<00:02:45.989> something<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.269> I'm

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
or something because I know that I'm

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.240 
or something because I know that I'm
doing<00:02:48.600> everything<00:02:48.959> I'm<00:02:49.260> supposed<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
doing everything I'm supposed to do and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.540 
doing everything I'm supposed to do and
the<00:02:50.820> scale<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.390> not<00:02:51.600> reflecting<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.160> maybe

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the scale is not reflecting it so maybe

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.720 
the scale is not reflecting it so maybe
I'm<00:02:53.850> doing<00:02:54.060> too<00:02:54.780> much<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.470> maybe<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.340> sounds

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
I'm doing too much and maybe that sounds

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 
I'm doing too much and maybe that sounds
crazy<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.510> don't<00:02:57.840> know<00:02:58.050> but<00:02:58.319> I'm<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> try

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
crazy I don't know but I'm going to try

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.820 
crazy I don't know but I'm going to try
this<00:02:59.610> for<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> week<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.440> going

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
this for a week and see if this is going

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.100 
this for a week and see if this is going
to<00:03:01.920> help<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.120> meantime<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:04.050> have

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.100 
to help but in the meantime I have
decided<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.600> time<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:06.840> me

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
decided that you know it's time for me

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.380 
decided that you know it's time for me
to<00:03:07.260> change<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.430> love<00:03:08.760> Zumba<00:03:09.269> to

death<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.940> feel<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.780> worked<00:03:13.170> for

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
death and I just feel like it worked for

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.340 
death and I just feel like it worked for
me<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.950> beginning<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:15.510> time<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.140> me

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
me in the beginning but it's time for me

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.800
