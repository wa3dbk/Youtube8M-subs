00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
spin off these helmets so i'm going to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320 
spin off these helmets so i'm going to
show<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.690> um<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.130> need<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.640> mixing

show you um for this we need a mixing
jug<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.779> mold<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:22.199> resin<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
jug a mold and some resin this is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.150 
jug a mold and some resin this is
two-part<00:00:23.160> easy<00:00:23.310> cast<00:00:23.580> makes<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.060> half<00:00:25.160> what

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
two-part easy cast makes it in half what

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
two-part easy cast makes it in half what
we<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.490> stir<00:00:27.359> sticks<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.720> helpful<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> grab

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we do stir sticks are helpful you grab

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.990 
we do stir sticks are helpful you grab
your<00:00:31.260> resin<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:32.279> half<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:35.390> 150<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
your resin and for half of it 150 I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
your resin and for half of it 150 I
usually<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> couple<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.840> parts<00:00:40.160> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
usually do these in a couple of parts so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
usually do these in a couple of parts so
I<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:41.820> resin<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.020> mold

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I don't get too much resin in the mold

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:54.540 
I don't get too much resin in the mold
at<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.469> time

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.530 

you<00:00:55.550> want<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.760> give<00:00:55.850> it<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.940> good<00:00:56.059> stir<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.450> make

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
you want to give it a good stir to make

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.930 
you want to give it a good stir to make
sure<00:00:56.690> it's<00:00:56.809> mixed<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.170> properly<00:00:57.760> I've<00:00:58.760> had<00:00:58.910> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
sure it's mixed in properly I've had a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.069 
sure it's mixed in properly I've had a
couple<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.300> helmets<00:00:59.570> where<00:00:59.690> if<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.870> wasn't

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
couple of helmets where if it wasn't

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.360 
couple of helmets where if it wasn't
mixed<00:01:00.260> properly<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.710> just<00:01:00.860> doesn't<00:01:01.160> set<00:01:01.340> right

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
mixed properly it just doesn't set right

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.889 
mixed properly it just doesn't set right
that<00:01:01.730> ends<00:01:01.879> up<00:01:01.940> all<00:01:02.090> sticky<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:02.480> gooey<00:01:02.690> and

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
that ends up all sticky and gooey and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:17.830 
that ends up all sticky and gooey and
not<00:01:03.800> very<00:01:03.890> useful<00:01:15.970> before<00:01:16.970> resin<00:01:17.570> into<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
not very useful before resin into the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.669 
not very useful before resin into the
mold<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.659> then<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.899> fun<00:01:24.110> begins<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:24.890> just

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
mold and then the fun begins it's just

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.779 
mold and then the fun begins it's just
rotating<00:01:27.679> it<00:01:27.800> sloshing<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.340> resin<00:01:28.550> around

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
rotating it sloshing the resin around

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.219 
rotating it sloshing the resin around
and<00:01:29.450> getting<00:01:29.660> it<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.780> cover<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.140> entire

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
and getting it to cover the entire

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
and getting it to cover the entire
inside<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> mold

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
inside of the mold

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.490 
inside of the mold
this<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.120> first<00:01:34.330> part<00:01:34.630> what<00:01:35.080> we'll<00:01:35.230> do<00:01:35.350> is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
this is the first part what we'll do is

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.560 
this is the first part what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:35.620> get<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:36.010> good<00:01:36.670> even<00:01:36.940> coating<00:01:37.150> around<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
we'll get a good even coating around the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.980 
we'll get a good even coating around the
inside<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.080> one<00:01:38.230> cast<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.700> one<00:01:40.030> part<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.690> then

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
inside in one cast or one part and then

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.040 
inside in one cast or one part and then
I'll<00:01:41.170> mix<00:01:41.530> up<00:01:41.680> another<00:01:42.720> small<00:01:43.720> amount<00:01:43.960> of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
I'll mix up another small amount of

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.870 
I'll mix up another small amount of
resin<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.410> repeat<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.190> process<00:01:45.280> three<00:01:45.790> or

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
resin and repeat the process three or

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.610 
resin and repeat the process three or
four<00:01:46.030> times<00:01:48.510> right<00:01:49.510> so<00:01:49.780> we've<00:01:50.230> got<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> helmet

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
four times right so we've got the helmet

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.870 
four times right so we've got the helmet
i'll<00:01:50.800> split<00:01:51.010> up<00:01:51.160> what<00:01:51.430> we're<00:01:51.520> going<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.700> do<00:01:51.790> now

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
i'll split up what we're going to do now

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.200 
i'll split up what we're going to do now
is<00:01:51.910> take<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.210> out<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.450> mold<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.910> not<00:01:55.060> an

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
is take it out of the mold it's not an

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.430 
is take it out of the mold it's not an
overly<00:01:55.420> difficult<00:01:55.600> thing<00:01:55.930> if<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.170> helmets

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
overly difficult thing if the helmets

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.830 
overly difficult thing if the helmets
been<00:01:56.620> spun<00:01:56.860> all<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.700> do<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.180> pull<00:01:58.810> the

visor<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.760> excess<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.210> the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
visor and just the the excess on the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:04:20.930 
visor and just the the excess on the
base<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:38.110> dremel

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.270 

so<00:04:21.940> once<00:04:22.120> we've<00:04:22.620> once<00:04:23.620> we've<00:04:23.740> got<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.890> all<00:04:24.040> cut

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
so once we've once we've got it all cut

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.660 
so once we've once we've got it all cut
