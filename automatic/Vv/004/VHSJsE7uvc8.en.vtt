00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.340
 man is heidi and these are the 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.230
 tutorials of the arriving Martians 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.020
 dot com 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.570
 this is the project of today are 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.690
 some origami earrings 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 the materials that we are going to need 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.080
 appear in this list 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 let's take our little box of 8 x 4 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 and let's do a first doubles taking 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 consider these two points and let's 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 approaching in this way is important 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 that you remember that in origami finish that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.180
 make the folds very firm so that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.130
 the figure is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.880
 as neat as possible 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.980
 now these two points are going to join 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.710
 also through a fold here 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.219
 we position them 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 and we made a doubles make sure first 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.530
 that are aligned before performing the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 double as I tell you this is the part 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 important of the art of shore here already 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.010
 that very well 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.409
 that's how it is and we unfolded it and see how it goes 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.230
 being on the inside this is going to 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.160
 do 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.190
 and let's use this diagonal line and we're going to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.040
 fold the pizza in two this way it 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 speaks 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.680
 now the upper corner we're going to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 bend inward like turning it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.270
 a triangle 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.929
 very well impressing strongly in the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.820
 paper and we will repeat the same thing with the 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.000
 another corner 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.720
 this is cinema doubling it and converting it 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 in a triangle 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.350
 now let's do another one again 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 doubles this time this triangle we are going to 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.020
 bring down 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.900
 well in this way and we are going to repeat the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.900
 same procedure with the side 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.720
 and we have like a kind of triangle 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.950
 as you see and now we are going to upload these 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.830
 sideways up first I'm going to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.319
 make sure that the double interior is 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.859
 because what I'm going to do 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.090
 upload look here if you lined it up with this 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.780
 center line 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 this side and I will do the same with 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.989
 the other but do the back there 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.540
 is almost finished our 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.840
 little fish with these doubles we are going to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.840
 create 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.819
 and what we need is to create the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.330
 fins of the fish what we are going to do is 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.170
 fold this top part into a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.790
 diagonal like this in order to create a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.030
 pair of fins 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 remember to support you and firm bend my 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.770
 so if the athletes of our 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.770
 fish 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.100
 remember how important it is to support 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.150
 a table when you work with origami 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.940
 so that the folds are solid and 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.520
 there is our little fish and here I am going 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.060
 to show a trick is happening this 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.330
 letter to backwards and the other one is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.790
 forward as for them 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.180
 fit and hold on to each other and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.829
 do not open 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.829
 there they are ready 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.780
 and to finish the finish we're going to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.330
 turn it into arequito then with 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.880
 thick needles here I'm making a 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.440
 indication where I want to drill and we're going 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.790
 to perforate the paper 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.640
 well in this way 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.409
 a hole big enough 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.409
 to pass a ring 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:15.340
 the holder for an ear does not 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.910
 so here I have the ring 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.440
 and a support for a habit here is what 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.440
 what we are going to do is finish them 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.780
 and already pressing here we created one of 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.570
 I remove we repeat the whole procedure and 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.190
 we have unemployment I hope that I have 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.290
