column and you it would be quite a good
idea<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.560> have<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.920> little<00:01:27.979> practice<00:01:28.310> before

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
idea to have a little practice before

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.060 
idea to have a little practice before
you<00:01:29.000> get<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.810> square<00:01:30.049> yes<00:01:30.439> yes<00:01:30.890> if

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
you get going on the square yes yes if

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.740 
you get going on the square yes yes if
you're<00:01:31.189> not<00:01:31.340> familiar<00:01:31.549> with<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.330> latest

you're not familiar with the latest

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.050 
you're not familiar with the latest
techniques<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.860> will<00:01:33.950> be<00:01:34.010> quite<00:01:34.250> good<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.729> try

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
techniques it will be quite good to try

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.149 
techniques it will be quite good to try
beyond<00:01:35.479> four<00:01:35.810> words<00:01:36.080> than<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.320> decrease

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
beyond four words than the decrease

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.219 
beyond four words than the decrease
things<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:38.119> well<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:38.600> they're<00:01:38.750> all<00:01:38.900> fairly

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
things as well but they're all fairly

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.530 
things as well but they're all fairly
simple<00:01:39.710> techniques<00:01:40.159> that<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.939> will<00:01:41.150> have<00:01:41.240> used

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
simple techniques that we will have used

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.120 
simple techniques that we will have used
in<00:01:42.280> knitting<00:01:43.280> garments<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.990> it's<00:01:45.770> just<00:01:45.979> a

in knitting garments and it's just a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.039

both<00:02:31.280> men<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.730> for<00:02:32.000> women<00:02:32.030> though<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.260> I

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
both men and for women though and I

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.690 
both men and for women though and I
guess<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.709> techniques<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.189> you've<00:02:34.430> learnt

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
guess the techniques that you've learnt

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.300 
guess the techniques that you've learnt
on<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> Afghan<00:02:35.569> squares<00:02:36.379> like<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.859> said<00:02:37.099> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
on the Afghan squares like you said the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.580 
on the Afghan squares like you said the
increasing<00:02:37.969> and<00:02:38.090> decreasing<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.409> can

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
increasing and decreasing then you can

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.429 
increasing and decreasing then you can
use<00:02:39.769> those<00:02:40.040> too<00:02:40.400> yes<00:02:41.019> though<00:02:42.019> become

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
use those too yes though become

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.910 
use those too yes though become
particularly<00:02:42.889> useful<00:02:43.849> for<00:02:44.389> when<00:02:44.540> you're

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
particularly useful for when you're

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.339 
particularly useful for when you're
shaping<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.219> sleeve<00:02:46.489> head<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.349> also

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
shaping the sleeve head and also

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.420 
shaping the sleeve head and also
decreasing<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.219> necks<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:51.430> anything

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
decreasing for the necks and anything

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.830 
decreasing for the necks and anything
that's<00:02:52.639> particularly<00:02:53.030> fitted<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.599> this

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
that's particularly fitted in this
