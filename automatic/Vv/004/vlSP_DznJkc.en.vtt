00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 new season 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.449
 supernatural from the very beginning at 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 we had common life orientations and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.020
 mobs longed for our success 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 the show and were ready to attach to this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.670
 all efforts and so while we walked together to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 the intended goal we actually and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 friends I think it is obvious that we are with him 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.829
 the very first day team we realized that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.079
 support each other we can achieve 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.700
 more 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.410
 this little being just colleagues 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 work 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 know some actors having worked in all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 year they say we are so united 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 the team we love the whole crew 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 and everything is fine I think for 10 years we 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 proved that steel worked well 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.500
 fake when the show is over ours 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 friendship will be stronger 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 hours a week you start quietly him 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 just be friends let's say let's hang out 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.250
 every joke has some truth and guard 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 I just remember we were libraries 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 I thought about Vancouver and talk on the set 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 cards from the card file she still 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.729

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420
