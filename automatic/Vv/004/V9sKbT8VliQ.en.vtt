00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
yahoo in this instance i suggest you

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.700 
yahoo in this instance i suggest you
start<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:11.480> google<00:02:11.990> by<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.440> their

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
start with google by going to their

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.560 
start with google by going to their
adsense<00:02:13.310> program<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.030> test<00:02:17.360> out

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
adsense program and you can test out

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.370

yahoo<00:02:17.870> later

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380

yahoo later
but<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.500> think<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.250> start<00:02:19.520> out<00:02:19.670> adsense<00:02:20.180> is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
but I think to start out adsense is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.530 
but I think to start out adsense is
better<00:02:20.650> when<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> put<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.250> adsense<00:02:22.940> code<00:02:23.210> on

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
better when you put the adsense code on

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.510 
better when you put the adsense code on
your<00:02:23.600> page<00:02:24.350> because<00:02:25.010> you're<00:02:25.130> creating<00:02:25.490> more
