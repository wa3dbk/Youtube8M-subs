Nike Dunk ESPYs I think the dunk as a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.630 
Nike Dunk ESPYs I think the dunk as a
whole<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.280> good

tab<00:01:40.619> which<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.070> looks<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.579> really

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
tab which I think looks really really

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
tab which I think looks really really
good<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> black<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.869> black<00:01:42.899> theme

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
good so I like the black on black theme

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
good so I like the black on black theme
here<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> white<00:01:44.640> accent<00:01:45.149> stitching

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
here with that white accent stitching

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.450 
here with that white accent stitching
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> course<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.649> atomic

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and then of course you have your atomic

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.940 
and then of course you have your atomic
read<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> heel<00:01:48.360> liner<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
read in the heel liner as well as in the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
read in the heel liner as well as in the
laces<00:01:50.340> itself<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> went<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> go

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
or the atomic read definitely looks a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
or the atomic read definitely looks a
lot<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.930> orange<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> person<00:01:59.219> atomic<00:01:59.939> red

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
same atomic red color your Zoom Air in

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.020 
same atomic red color your Zoom Air in
black<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.710> know<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.040> great<00:02:36.190> about<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.520> SPS<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
black I know it's great about the SPS is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.610 
black I know it's great about the SPS is
like<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.300> said<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.570> are<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> lot<00:02:38.020> more<00:02:38.050> cushion

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
like I said they are a lot more cushion

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.080 
like I said they are a lot more cushion
so<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.830> do<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.220> zoom<00:02:39.520> unit<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
so you do have that zoom unit in the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.910 
so you do have that zoom unit in the
heel<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.810> provides<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.230> little<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.650> extra

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
heel that provides a little bit of extra

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.770 
heel that provides a little bit of extra
comfort<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.459> then<00:02:42.880> kind<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> pore<00:02:43.750> on

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
comfort and then kind of like a pore on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.260 
comfort and then kind of like a pore on
like<00:02:44.200> foam<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:44.770> very<00:02:44.980> soft<00:02:45.310> spongy<00:02:45.850> foam<00:02:46.060> in
