00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.490
 ok welcome to a new tutorial in the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 I'm going to show you how to send 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.990
 songs by whatsapp this is the city 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 of said from long before but until 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
 Now I have the time to do it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 time for this we need some 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.329
 applications that are essential for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.970
 which will have to make it work 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.220
 this this trick obviously we need 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 first of all whatsapp I put here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.800
 abajito this we will also have to have 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.170
 a cloud service like for example 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.880
 dropbox good I use dropbox but 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 now I can show you what the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.680
 services that are admitted to be able 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.630
 do this and other applications that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 is what we mainly need 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.580
 to be able to do it is to be in this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 application works with several 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.980
 servers in the cloud then it hosts us 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 in a single application and then this 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.850
 application we can get it by 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.570
 medium of the program that I have shown you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.090
 thousands and thousands of times that is the pp 25 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.229
 is this program that we have Carlos 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 we are going to go look for it here in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 the manzanita 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.260
 we're going to look for it and it's the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.510
 first option that appears in our 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.910
 searches we give you download and it 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 download then stay cut and with this 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.930
 button we synchronize it with our 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.940
 device after this obviously are 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.190
 to the manzanita and they give this box 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.110
 Blue considering that we have to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.270
 have itunes closed so you can 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 operate this blue button ends the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.190
 synchronization and we can already have the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.260
 application on our device 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.570
 member still quit the application is jane 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.950
 so that you can observe which 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.289
 is this we have here time 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.539
 long before we will have to have here 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.640
 same synchronizing our services 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.280
 to 9 for example I have something else that 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.259
 I have it here and we have these 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 here in more we can see what are the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.340
 cloud services that supports the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 application is boxbus metrobus 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 script and double tags must be linked 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.759
 several after several sorry servers 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.890
 let's add 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.480
 for example we put our new 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.819
 user that is our mail with which 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 mostly we need and good we continue 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.629
 giving him passwords and everything so that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 we can synchronize our selected 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.430
 once we have this well then because 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.830
 we are almost ready almost ready to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.440
 to be able to send the application another thing is 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.760
 that we need a computer either pc or 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.769
 mac gives equal and have good this the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.379
 dropbox application on the computer 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.560
 or you can go in the browser and look for the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.560
 boxee and there put the song that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.900
 we need to send an example of what 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.959
 what I did is go to the fire and find my 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.489
 music open and send this song by 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.090
 example we must copy right click 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.000
 copy and everything calling dropbox that is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.099
 here where live put well we need 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.410
 necessarily have the song that 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.480
 We want to send in our server in 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.960
 the cloud in this case I'm using 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 another post 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.960
 once we have this we synchronize 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.620
 our cloud application with the 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.080
 application and go look good once 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 let's do this let's go to our 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.020
 service in the cloud and let's give it here 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.440
 keeping pressed in the file that 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.710
 we want to send them in this case and we 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.120
 has appeared here below some options what 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.490
 first thing we have to do is press 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.650
 the icon that has a folder and a 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.380
 flip down and give him a little money 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.690
 main documents that will copy the song in 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.190
 our documents now we are going to 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.190
 wait for the download to finish 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.300
 once the download is complete 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.130
 we can return servers and we see that 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.510
 here is another folder that by itself brings 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.740
 the application that is called my 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.240
 documents 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.520
 we are going to open this application and we can 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.710
 see that here we have the song that 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.690
 I just downloaded for example is this 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.470
 that is here of second that of weight in 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.860
 yes the weight mp3 we will keep it 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 press again and on our side 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.400
 straight 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.380
 we have a three-dot icon in the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 which gives you several options and the one 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.420
 we will use to send the song 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.880
 by whatsapp it is open int and here it starts 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.070
 the margin because it gives us the option of 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.560
 open our our file 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.080
 song on whatsapp we are going to 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.889
 give open and we do the application well 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.169
 by WhatsApp 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.749
 let's find the contact that really 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.629
 we want to send it to you in this case 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:53.849
 I'll send myself to the no 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.650
 bother anyone either that I 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.580
 answer 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.060
 obviously I'm going to give it 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.939
 and we see how he starts to send all the 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.789
 song like that in a line so that it 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.180
 fill let's wait for the song 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.180
 I sent 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.810
 well once we are about to finish 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.440
 some observe that they are already looking at 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.130
 song and finally send it and I finish it 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.710
 of this receive I am not going to download 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.360
 here I already have all forms I'm just going to 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.340
 give produce so that you can see 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.340
 which is actually working 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.280
 and well really 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.340
 but really that would be all 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.500
 it really is somewhat complicated are several 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.660
 steps but it's worth sending a 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.340
 song by whatsapp the 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.009
 extreme possibility that someday we're going 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.590
 to make it easier and everything but fine already 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.349
 we have it like that that would be all 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.900
 tutorial what you need is whatsapp a 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.820
 cloud service and this application that 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.460
 it's called services ok 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.320
 that would be all feet in a next 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.000
 tutorial I'll show you the same things 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.580
 quite interesting do not forget to 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.120
 Like if you liked it if you do not like it 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.120
 Thursday
