the Korean commentators are thinking

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
the Korean commentators are thinking
here<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:38.130> might<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.430> setting<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
here is he might be setting up for a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
here is he might be setting up for a
recall<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:40.259> again<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.159> good

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
recall which again would be really good

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
recall which again would be really good
he's<00:01:41.520> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> missed<00:01:42.030> his<00:01:42.240> opportunity<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
he's kind of missed his opportunity to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
he's kind of missed his opportunity to
over<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> third<00:01:44.340> base<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> frontal

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
over on that third base with a frontal

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.590 
over on that third base with a frontal
attack<00:01:45.240> but

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
attack but

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
attack but
okay<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.750> he's<00:01:48.930> setting<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.260> mines<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> stuff

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
okay now he's setting up mines and stuff

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.140 
okay now he's setting up mines and stuff
so<00:01:50.010> actually<00:01:50.280> special<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.730> doing<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.970> really

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
so actually special is doing a really

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.880 
so actually special is doing a really
good<00:01:51.270> job<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.630> defending<00:01:52.470> against<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
good job of defending against the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.970 
good job of defending against the
possible<00:01:53.310> recall<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.910> well<00:01:54.620> I've<00:01:55.620> got<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.800> bunch

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
possible recall as well I've got a bunch

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.880 
possible recall as well I've got a bunch
of<00:01:56.190> zealots<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:57.380> somebody<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.440> as<00:01:58.560> probes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
of zealots there somebody in as probes

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.440 
of zealots there somebody in as probes
are<00:01:59.070> rallied<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.550> front<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.150> nexus

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
are rallied to the front of this nexus

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.730 
are rallied to the front of this nexus
there<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:01.050> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> try<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.380> set<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.650> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
there it's going to try and set up a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.650 
there it's going to try and set up a
fourth<00:02:01.980> base<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.760> bus<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.480> play<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
fourth base so bus just play it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.620 
fourth base so bus just play it
basically<00:02:04.050> implying<00:02:04.470> macro<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.130> but

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
basically implying macro here but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.880 
basically implying macro here but
they're<00:02:06.630> ending<00:02:06.870> up<00:02:06.990> being<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:07.470> much<00:02:07.710> even

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they're ending up being pretty much even

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
they're ending up being pretty much even
in<00:02:08.220> basis<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.180> that's<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.960> give<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> bit

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
in basis so that's going to give a bit

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.810 
in basis so that's going to give a bit
of<00:02:10.560> an<00:02:10.680> advantage<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.150> two<00:02:12.150> special<00:02:13.820> pure

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
of an advantage to two special pure

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820 
of an advantage to two special pure
basically<00:02:15.360> needs<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.750> something<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:16.770> he

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
basically needs to do something here he

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.020 
basically needs to do something here he
needs<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> do<00:02:17.130> something<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.580> quick<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
needs to do something pretty quick and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270 
needs to do something pretty quick and
you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.330> tell<00:02:18.600> he's<00:02:18.750> probing<00:02:19.320> for<00:02:19.890> recall

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you can tell he's probing for recall

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.700 
you can tell he's probing for recall
location<00:02:20.730> sending<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.210> his<00:02:21.300> observers<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.960> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
see where is vulnerable for a recall

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
see where is vulnerable for a recall
seeing<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:25.680> there's<00:02:25.860> mines<00:02:26.160> seeing<00:02:26.880> if

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
seeing if there's mines seeing if

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.490 
seeing if there's mines seeing if
there's<00:02:27.150> any<00:02:27.330> defenses<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> back<00:02:28.230> there

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
there's any defenses in the back there

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.230 
there's any defenses in the back there
and<00:02:28.890> he<00:02:29.010> has<00:02:29.190> planted<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> lot<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.910> mines<00:02:30.090> around

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
and he has planted a lot of mines around

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120 
and he has planted a lot of mines around
his<00:02:30.420> main<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:30.840> still<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.110> some<00:02:31.500> some

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
his main but there still are some some

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.040 
his main but there still are some some
gaps<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.580> those<00:02:32.700> defenses<00:02:33.210> not<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> ton<00:02:33.990> of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
gaps in those defenses not a ton of

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.810 
gaps in those defenses not a ton of
turrets<00:02:34.470> either<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.280> he's<00:02:35.400> gonna<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.640> able<00:02:35.700> to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
turrets either so he's gonna be able to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.570 
turrets either so he's gonna be able to
sneak<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.180> orbiter<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:37.610> unfettered<00:02:40.580> well

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
sneak that orbiter in unfettered well

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.130 
sneak that orbiter in unfettered well
nevermind<00:02:42.030> he's<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.510> charts<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.930> now<00:02:43.080> as

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
nevermind he's got more charts up now as

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.990 
nevermind he's got more charts up now as
well<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.500> Minds<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.430> good<00:02:44.700> defense

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
well more Minds so really good defense

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.360 
well more Minds so really good defense
against<00:02:45.270> Rico<00:02:45.570> actually<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.020> pure<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:47.070> it's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
against Rico actually so pure it's it's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070 
against Rico actually so pure it's it's
uh<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:47.940> needs<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.480> more<00:02:48.720> than<00:02:48.870> four

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
uh he needs to be at more than four

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140 
uh he needs to be at more than four
bases<00:02:49.440> right<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.770> actually<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.880> does<00:02:51.000> look

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
bases right now actually it does look

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.430 
bases right now actually it does look
like<00:02:51.210> he's<00:02:51.360> getting<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.660> fifth<00:02:51.930> base<00:02:52.110> up<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
like he's getting a fifth base up at the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.930 
like he's getting a fifth base up at the
three<00:02:52.590> o'clock<00:02:52.709> position<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.610> comes<00:02:53.820> that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
three o'clock position here comes that

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.840 
three o'clock position here comes that
arbiter<00:02:54.620> almost<00:02:55.620> decides<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.190> recall<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.700> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
arbiter almost decides to recall on that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.880 
arbiter almost decides to recall on that
location<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.420> there's<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.720> enough<00:02:57.989> scvs

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
location but there's not enough scvs

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.440 
location but there's not enough scvs
there<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> make<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> worth<00:02:59.459> his<00:02:59.489> while<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.330> he's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
there to make it worth his while so he's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.670 
there to make it worth his while so he's
going<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> go<00:03:00.720> straight<00:03:00.930> into<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> main<00:03:01.440> here

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
going to go straight into the main here

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.020 
going to go straight into the main here
that<00:03:02.040> turret<00:03:02.340> was<00:03:02.430> not<00:03:02.580> there<00:03:02.790> when<00:03:02.820> his

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that turret was not there when his

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
that turret was not there when his
observer<00:03:03.390> was<00:03:03.540> there<00:03:03.690> last<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.140> looks

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
observer was there last but it looks

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.390 
observer was there last but it looks
like<00:03:04.290> he's<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.800> run<00:03:05.010> past<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
like he's just going to run past that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
like he's just going to run past that
one<00:03:05.550> turret<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.970> recall<00:03:06.480> right<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.780> top<00:03:06.989> of

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
one turret and recall right on top of

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.960 
one turret and recall right on top of
that<00:03:07.140> one<00:03:07.290> tank<00:03:07.590> beautiful<00:03:08.190> recall<00:03:08.610> right<00:03:08.880> in

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
that one tank beautiful recall right in

maybe<00:05:59.100> next<00:05:59.220> time<00:06:01.400> he<00:06:02.400> was<00:06:02.490> able<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.700> take<00:06:02.850> out

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
maybe next time he was able to take out

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.190 
maybe next time he was able to take out
that<00:06:03.030> Tory<00:06:03.240> if<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.390> can<00:06:03.510> take<00:06:03.630> out<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.810> SCV

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
that Tory if you can take out the SCV

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.390 
that Tory if you can take out the SCV
building<00:06:04.500> command<00:06:04.860> center<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:05.250> would<00:06:05.340> be

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
building command center that would be

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.910 
building command center that would be
actually<00:06:05.570> almost<00:06:06.570> worth<00:06:07.200> it<00:06:07.380> he'd<00:06:07.590> be<00:06:07.710> able<00:06:07.770> to

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
actually almost worth it he'd be able to

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.330 
actually almost worth it he'd be able to
delay<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.310> lot<00:06:09.440> but<00:06:10.440> wow<00:06:10.710> so<00:06:10.950> special

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
delay it a lot but wow so special

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.070 
delay it a lot but wow so special
actually<00:06:11.640> and<00:06:12.120> basically<00:06:12.750> when<00:06:12.930> you're<00:06:13.020> in

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
actually and basically when you're in

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.150 
actually and basically when you're in
this<00:06:13.140> kind<00:06:13.320> of<00:06:13.380> position<00:06:13.710> you<00:06:13.830> just<00:06:14.010> need<00:06:14.130> a

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
this kind of position you just need a

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.570 
this kind of position you just need a
turtle<00:06:14.580> as<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.630> Terran<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:16.230> and<00:06:16.890> that's

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
turtle as a Terran and and that's

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.340 
turtle as a Terran and and that's
exactly<00:06:17.870> why<00:06:18.870> he's<00:06:18.960> not<00:06:19.050> paying<00:06:19.230> attention

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
exactly why he's not paying attention

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.840 
exactly why he's not paying attention
well<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:19.710> guess<00:06:19.860> there's<00:06:20.310> not<00:06:20.430> really<00:06:20.580> any

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
well I guess there's not really any

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.480 
well I guess there's not really any
farther<00:06:21.330> down<00:06:21.630> they<00:06:22.410> could<00:06:22.590> go<00:06:22.800> to<00:06:23.100> get<00:06:23.340> out<00:06:23.460> of

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
farther down they could go to get out of

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.880 
farther down they could go to get out of
range<00:06:23.970> there<00:06:24.210> so<00:06:24.420> that<00:06:24.450> one's<00:06:24.750> your<00:06:24.930> goon<00:06:25.080> with

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
range there so that one's your goon with

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.260 
range there so that one's your goon with
the<00:06:25.980> arbiter<00:06:26.310> is<00:06:26.430> just<00:06:26.640> going<00:06:26.730> to<00:06:26.790> be<00:06:26.880> chillin

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
the arbiter is just going to be chillin

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.700 
the arbiter is just going to be chillin
there<00:06:27.360> at<00:06:27.570> the<00:06:27.690> very<00:06:27.720> extent<00:06:28.320> at<00:06:28.470> the<00:06:28.560> very

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
there at the very extent at the very

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.010 
there at the very extent at the very
corner<00:06:29.040> of<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.160> map<00:06:32.060> with<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.240> coral<00:06:33.840> I

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
corner of the map with the coral I

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.870 
corner of the map with the coral I
noticed<00:06:34.710> they<00:06:34.830> use<00:06:34.950> a<00:06:34.980> lot<00:06:35.100> of<00:06:35.250> the<00:06:35.430> coral

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
noticed they use a lot of the coral

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.480 
noticed they use a lot of the coral
looking

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.659 

tiles<00:06:41.389> I<00:06:41.660> guess<00:06:41.930> textures<00:06:42.650> on<00:06:42.949> this<00:06:43.490> map

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
tiles I guess textures on this map

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.490 
tiles I guess textures on this map
because<00:06:43.880> it's<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.150> Great<00:06:44.449> Barrier<00:06:44.660> Reef

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.350 

anyway<00:06:48.500> yeah<00:06:48.860> so<00:06:49.099> he<00:06:49.250> but<00:06:49.490> special<00:06:50.150> ending

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
anyway yeah so he but special ending

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.710 
anyway yeah so he but special ending
needs<00:06:50.630> to<00:06:50.840> oh<00:06:51.430> nice<00:06:52.430> if<00:06:52.789> he<00:06:53.120> goes<00:06:53.300> off<00:06:53.449> on<00:06:53.479> the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
needs to oh nice if he goes off on the

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.520 
needs to oh nice if he goes off on the
arbiter<00:06:54.080> takes<00:06:54.979> it<00:06:55.190> out<00:06:55.310> um<00:06:55.900> no<00:06:56.900> recall<00:06:57.289> for

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
arbiter takes it out um no recall for

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.219 
arbiter takes it out um no recall for
you<00:06:57.650> and<00:06:58.030> but<00:06:59.030> yeah<00:06:59.150> so<00:06:59.509> actually<00:06:59.660> he's<00:06:59.990> doing

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
you and but yeah so actually he's doing

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.350 
you and but yeah so actually he's doing
okay<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.830> thought<00:07:01.639> he<00:07:01.759> was<00:07:01.880> gonna<00:07:01.970> have<00:07:02.150> to<00:07:02.240> put

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
okay I thought he was gonna have to put

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.020 
okay I thought he was gonna have to put
some<00:07:02.479> pressure<00:07:02.599> on<00:07:02.780> but<00:07:02.990> if<00:07:03.500> he<00:07:04.310> can<00:07:04.490> put<00:07:04.880> up

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
some pressure on but if he can put up

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.460 
some pressure on but if he can put up
down<00:07:05.210> all<00:07:05.419> these<00:07:05.509> bases<00:07:05.930> and<00:07:06.080> get<00:07:06.199> away<00:07:06.289> with

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
down all these bases and get away with

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.980 
down all these bases and get away with
it<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:06.949> works<00:07:07.160> too<00:07:07.430> I<00:07:07.669> don't<00:07:08.270> know<00:07:08.599> if<00:07:08.750> Pierre

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
it that works too I don't know if Pierre

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.180 
it that works too I don't know if Pierre
is<00:07:09.050> gonna<00:07:09.229> let<00:07:09.380> him<00:07:09.470> get<00:07:09.560> away<00:07:09.680> with<00:07:09.800> it<00:07:10.039> though

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
is gonna let him get away with it though

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.050 
is gonna let him get away with it though
as<00:07:10.400> the<00:07:10.970> thing<00:07:11.199> and<00:07:12.340> nicely<00:07:13.340> done<00:07:13.669> putting<00:07:13.940> a

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
as the thing and nicely done putting a

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.520 
as the thing and nicely done putting a
turret<00:07:14.330> down<00:07:14.509> in<00:07:14.780> the<00:07:14.870> middle<00:07:15.050> Oh<00:07:15.199> action

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
turret down in the middle Oh action

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.809 
turret down in the middle Oh action
nevermind<00:07:15.770> you<00:07:15.889> can<00:07:16.009> fit<00:07:16.159> it<00:07:16.280> in<00:07:16.400> between

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:16.819 
nevermind you can fit it in between

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:18.879 
nevermind you can fit it in between
those<00:07:17.180> two<00:07:17.360> turrets<00:07:17.539> not<00:07:18.319> the<00:07:18.500> optimal

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
those two turrets not the optimal

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.700 
those two turrets not the optimal
position<00:07:19.310> for<00:07:19.550> mining<00:07:19.819> the<00:07:19.909> minerals<00:07:20.210> but

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
position for mining the minerals but

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.100 
position for mining the minerals but
that'll<00:07:21.710> work<00:07:21.830> I<00:07:21.979> guess<00:07:22.039> anyway<00:07:22.970> so<00:07:23.900> actually

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
that'll work I guess anyway so actually

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.540 
that'll work I guess anyway so actually
specialist<00:07:24.740> managed<00:07:24.949> to<00:07:25.039> get<00:07:25.130> a<00:07:25.190> couple<00:07:25.430> more

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
specialist managed to get a couple more

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.790 
specialist managed to get a couple more
bases<00:07:26.090> up<00:07:26.270> so<00:07:26.780> he's<00:07:26.960> managed<00:07:27.259> to<00:07:27.289> kind<00:07:27.560> of<00:07:27.590> tie

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
bases up so he's managed to kind of tie

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.680 
bases up so he's managed to kind of tie
things<00:07:28.069> back<00:07:28.280> up<00:07:28.310> it's<00:07:28.669> now<00:07:29.710> now<00:07:30.710> I<00:07:30.740> think<00:07:30.919> five

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:31.690 
things back up it's now now I think five

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.600 
things back up it's now now I think five
phases<00:07:32.690> 26<00:07:33.110> and<00:07:33.830> he's<00:07:33.919> actually<00:07:34.069> trying<00:07:34.340> to

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
phases 26 and he's actually trying to

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.029 
phases 26 and he's actually trying to
land<00:07:35.030> a<00:07:35.240> sixth<00:07:35.630> base<00:07:35.870> at<00:07:36.080> that<00:07:36.199> top<00:07:36.680> left

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
land a sixth base at that top left

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.920 
land a sixth base at that top left
position<00:07:37.190> so<00:07:37.550> that<00:07:37.580> would<00:07:37.940> be<00:07:37.970> that<00:07:38.690> will<00:07:38.810> put

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
position so that would be that will put

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.159 
position so that would be that will put
them<00:07:39.050> in<00:07:39.110> a<00:07:39.169> good<00:07:39.289> in<00:07:39.560> a<00:07:39.710> pretty<00:07:39.919> good<00:07:40.009> spot

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
them in a good in a pretty good spot

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.629 
them in a good in a pretty good spot
pure<00:07:42.169> has<00:07:42.409> a<00:07:42.440> couple<00:07:42.830> extra<00:07:42.889> bases<00:07:43.220> that<00:07:43.460> he'd

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 
pure has a couple extra bases that he'd

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.610 
pure has a couple extra bases that he'd
easily<00:07:44.090> take<00:07:44.360> those<00:07:44.599> the<00:07:44.810> thing<00:07:45.020> let's<00:07:45.530> look

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
easily take those the thing let's look

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.200 
easily take those the thing let's look
at<00:07:45.740> their<00:07:45.830> supply<00:07:46.190> counts<00:07:46.520> here<00:07:46.639> real<00:07:46.969> quick

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210 
at their supply counts here real quick

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.629 
at their supply counts here real quick
yeah<00:07:47.719> pure<00:07:48.110> is<00:07:48.289> almost<00:07:48.650> maxed<00:07:48.919> out<00:07:49.159> so<00:07:49.430> that's

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 
yeah pure is almost maxed out so that's

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.560 
yeah pure is almost maxed out so that's
why<00:07:49.759> we<00:07:49.820> see<00:07:50.030> him<00:07:50.120> trying<00:07:50.270> to<00:07:50.330> do<00:07:50.449> these

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570 
why we see him trying to do these

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.749 
why we see him trying to do these
recalls<00:07:50.930> and<00:07:51.110> what<00:07:51.199> have<00:07:51.349> you<00:07:51.490> he<00:07:52.490> almost

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 
recalls and what have you he almost

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.100 
recalls and what have you he almost
doesn't<00:07:52.909> need<00:07:53.180> more<00:07:53.330> bases<00:07:53.659> at<00:07:53.750> the<00:07:53.780> moment

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.110 
doesn't need more bases at the moment

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.209 
doesn't need more bases at the moment
here<00:07:54.229> comes<00:07:54.440> in<00:07:54.560> for<00:07:54.710> a<00:07:54.740> bit<00:07:54.830> of<00:07:54.860> a<00:07:54.979> recall

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:55.219 
here comes in for a bit of a recall

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.490 
here comes in for a bit of a recall
coming<00:07:55.520> from<00:07:55.639> the<00:07:55.759> side<00:07:55.969> for<00:07:56.690> that<00:07:56.840> our<00:07:57.169> murder

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.500 
coming from the side for that our murder

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.620 
coming from the side for that our murder
that<00:07:57.620> was<00:07:57.710> stuck<00:07:57.919> in<00:07:58.070> the<00:07:58.159> back<00:07:58.340> now<00:07:59.150> coming

00:07:59.620 --> 00:07:59.630 
that was stuck in the back now coming

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.360 
that was stuck in the back now coming
into<00:07:59.780> play<00:07:59.960> again<00:08:00.259> he's<00:08:00.560> moved<00:08:00.860> most<00:08:01.130> of<00:08:01.250> the

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.370 
into play again he's moved most of the

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.770 
into play again he's moved most of the
tanks<00:08:01.490> from<00:08:01.699> that<00:08:01.880> Ridge<00:08:02.060> that<00:08:02.120> were<00:08:02.419> that

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.780 
tanks from that Ridge that were that

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.360 
tanks from that Ridge that were that
were<00:08:02.840> killing<00:08:03.169> off<00:08:03.259> those<00:08:03.409> dragoons<00:08:03.710> and<00:08:03.979> so

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.370 
were killing off those dragoons and so
