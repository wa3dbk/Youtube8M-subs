of the old adage just reduce your
caloric<00:00:11.759> intake<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.690> 500<00:00:13.440> calories<00:00:13.889> per<00:00:14.099> day

caloric intake by 500 calories per day

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.019 
caloric intake by 500 calories per day
doing<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.900> would<00:00:16.170> then<00:00:16.350> lead<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.029> 3500

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
doing this would then lead to a 3500

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.900 
doing this would then lead to a 3500
calorie<00:00:18.330> deficit<00:00:18.930> per<00:00:19.199> week<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.650> pound<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> fat

calorie deficit per week a pound of fat

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.230 
calorie deficit per week a pound of fat
has<00:00:21.529> 3500<00:00:22.529> calories<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.670> would<00:00:23.850> easily

well<00:00:28.050> I've<00:00:28.320> tried<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.279> results<00:00:29.640> were

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
well I've tried this in my results were

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.139 
well I've tried this in my results were
less<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:30.420> stellar<00:00:30.949> at<00:00:31.949> best<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.550> stayed<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
less than stellar at best I stayed the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.720 
less than stellar at best I stayed the
same<00:00:33.180> weight<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.680> weeks<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.219> actually

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
same weight but some weeks I actually

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.150 
same weight but some weeks I actually
gained<00:00:36.030> weight<00:00:36.329> albe<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> slower<00:00:38.040> rate

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
gained weight albe it at a slower rate

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
gained weight albe it at a slower rate
than<00:00:38.520> before<00:00:39.260> why<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:41.090> well<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.450> calorie

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
than before why is this well my calorie

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.010 
than before why is this well my calorie
level<00:00:43.230> was<00:00:43.379> still<00:00:43.620> too<00:00:43.890> high<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.910> cutting<00:00:45.239> 500

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
level was still too high so cutting 500

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.080 
level was still too high so cutting 500
calories<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.620> every<00:00:47.129> day<00:00:47.309> did<00:00:47.610> nothing<00:00:48.059> for

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
calories out every day did nothing for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.590 
calories out every day did nothing for
me

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
me

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
me
because<00:00:49.230> even<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.160> 500<00:00:50.460> calorie

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because even with that 500 calorie

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
because even with that 500 calorie
deficit<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.620> still<00:00:52.890> eating<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> calorie

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
deficit I was still eating at a calorie

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
deficit I was still eating at a calorie
level<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.600> enough<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> cause<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
level that was enough to cause little to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.189 
level that was enough to cause little to
no<00:00:56.460> weight<00:00:56.670> loss

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
no weight loss

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
no weight loss
you<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.620> tend<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> overestimate<00:00:59.690> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you see we tend to overestimate the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.070 
you see we tend to overestimate the
number<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:01.079> calories<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
number of calories that we need and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.820 
number of calories that we need and
underestimate<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> number<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.589> calories

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> diet<00:01:18.600> work<00:01:19.189> first<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.430> need<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
kind of diet work first you need to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.620 
kind of diet work first you need to
determine<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.750> calorie<00:01:22.259> goal<00:01:23.630> 1,500

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
determine your calorie goal 1,500

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
determine your calorie goal 1,500
calories<00:01:25.049> per<00:01:25.259> day<00:01:25.290> may<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.280> too<00:01:26.759> few<00:01:27.060> calories

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
calories per day may be too few calories

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.600 
calories per day may be too few calories
or<00:01:27.720> too<00:01:28.259> many<00:01:28.439> depending<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.400> target

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
or too many depending on your target

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.289 
or too many depending on your target
weight<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.979> quick<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> determine<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
weight a quick way to determine this is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.100 
weight a quick way to determine this is
to<00:01:34.229> multiply<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.729> target<00:01:36.329> weight<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.750> pounds

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to multiply your target weight in pounds

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
to multiply your target weight in pounds
times<00:01:37.770> 10<00:01:38.600> thus<00:01:39.600> 1,500<00:01:40.470> calories<00:01:40.920> becomes<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
times 10 thus 1,500 calories becomes the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.870 
times 10 thus 1,500 calories becomes the
appropriate<00:01:42.240> target<00:01:42.720> goal<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.530> calories<00:01:43.979> for

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
appropriate target goal for calories for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.700 
appropriate target goal for calories for
a<00:01:44.909> person<00:01:45.360> who<00:01:45.509> wants<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> weigh<00:01:46.610> 150<00:01:47.610> pounds

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
a person who wants to weigh 150 pounds

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
a person who wants to weigh 150 pounds
there<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.310> other<00:01:50.490> ways<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> determine

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
there are some other ways to determine

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.539 
there are some other ways to determine
this<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> important<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> realize<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this but it's important to realize that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
this but it's important to realize that
we<00:01:54.000> always<00:01:54.479> tend<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.320> overestimate<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
we always tend to overestimate the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
we always tend to overestimate the
number<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.670> calories<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.750> need<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
number of calories we actually need to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.639 
number of calories we actually need to
eat<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.439> weight<00:01:58.590> loss<00:02:00.140> obviously<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.409> don't

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
eat for weight loss obviously you don't

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
eat for weight loss obviously you don't

second way to think about a low-calorie

second way to think about a low-calorie
diet<00:02:20.460> such<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.540> 1500<00:02:22.260> calorie<00:02:22.560> diet<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.100> to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
diet such as a 1500 calorie diet is to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.870 
diet such as a 1500 calorie diet is to
create<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> weekly<00:02:24.930> average<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.770> 1500<00:02:26.730> calories

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
create a weekly average of 1500 calories

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.370 
create a weekly average of 1500 calories
consumed<00:02:27.720> per<00:02:27.990> day

10,500 calorie per week diet you can

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960 
10,500 calorie per week diet you can
