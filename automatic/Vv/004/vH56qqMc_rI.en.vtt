00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 Christian Ehrhoff is leaving 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 North American NHL for the buffalo 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 sailers out of ice during the summer break 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 However, joined in the home 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 the krefeld penguins fit for the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 coming del season still remembered 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.460
 like to return to his time at the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.230
 krefeld penguins and the won 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 german championship 2003 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 it was the highlight of mine for me 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 I have a career here in ice hockey 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 started playing and then the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 to get the championship with the professionals 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.399
 was a huge thing and yes I think so 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.079
 like to get back to it as is a current one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.370
 impression of the penguins and questions 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 not the young players sometimes after 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.989
 yes the young players ask me 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.379
 after advice and my impression is good the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.050
 guys all work very hard and 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.350
 strings camp is of course long and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 important is this film how the the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.960
 stay injury free because that was 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 but last year but then the biggest 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 problem for nine years now plays 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 already in america where do you feel? 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.460
 meanwhile native I have to say 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 I also feel at home in America 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.070
 I feel good and just as well 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.840
 But I'm happy every summer 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 When it's back to Germany 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 I go and I am happy and family again 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 but it does not look like that for me 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 I'm getting worse now 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.119
 so i feel in both of them 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.140
 countries well 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.380
 what are the differences between 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
 the dl and the north american nhl 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.790
 must say that the giant 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 Differences are of course the first 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 area is much smaller thereby plays 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.810
 the game is much faster and faster 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 body-conscious and it in nature 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 of course, the best players in the world 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 this makes the game a bit more 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.530
 done with the buffalo saber you have 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.100
 Last time the playoffs missed what did 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.950
 you missed ultimately that was the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.840
 reason also that we are very big 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.899
 injury pitch had last year 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.869
 and for me it was only his buffalo 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.209
 I feel very well there and I regret it 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.440
 the decision did not go there 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.090
 be and I think in the coming 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.040
 Years we will also play up 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.849
 can 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.260
 last you have in a buffalo 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.000
 defense series with alexander sulzer 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.720
 This was an advantage for you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.920
 that we already from the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 national team knew 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.700
 not necessarily but I have to say 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.799
 we harmonized immediately and that is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.209
 went very well for us both and 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.989
 That's why I hope that we too 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.540
 this again a bit 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.819
 playing with the vancouver canucks 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 have you ever been to the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.360
 stanley cup finals are as optimistic 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.170
 you also once the nfl championship 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.329
 to win 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.280
 yes I am already very much 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.140
 I'm optimistic about that 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.360
 actually the step to buffalo 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.430
 done because I think we have one 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.379
 have good team and i hope that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.209
 then the next couple of years 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.109
 its sold I press you for the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.109
 thumbs thanks
