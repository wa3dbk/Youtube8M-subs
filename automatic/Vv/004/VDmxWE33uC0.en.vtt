00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and stuff like that so I recommend using

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
and stuff like that so I recommend using
dual<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.480> starters<00:00:48.809> obviously<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.920> you're

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
dual for starters obviously if you're

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
dual for starters obviously if you're
better<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.370> some<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.640> web<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> class<00:00:51.000> use

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
better with some other web and class use

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
better with some other web and class use
that<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.690> majority<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.620> people<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that one but majority of people want to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
that one but majority of people want to
use<00:00:53.190> dual<00:00:53.660> alright<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> second<00:00:55.230> tip<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
use dual alright so the second tip is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
use dual alright so the second tip is
going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.579> said<00:00:56.760> before<00:00:56.879> using

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
going to be like i said before using

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
going to be like i said before using
dual<00:00:57.660> lets<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.899> free<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.260> stat<00:00:58.500> points<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
dual lets you free your stat points so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.830 
dual lets you free your stat points so
you<00:00:59.789> don't<00:00:59.910> have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> allocate<00:01:00.390> any<00:01:00.539> just

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you don't have to allocate any just

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.950 
you don't have to allocate any just
shield<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.320> anything<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.449> allocate

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
shield or anything so you can allocate

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.179 
shield or anything so you can allocate
them<00:01:04.170> wherever<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:07.159> what<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
them wherever you want and so what I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
them wherever you want and so what I
Arabic<00:01:08.610> recommend<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> adding<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.140> step

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
Arabic recommend is adding all your step

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
Arabic recommend is adding all your step
wants<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> attack<00:01:10.979> because<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> really

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wants to attack because that is a really

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.690 
wants to attack because that is a really
good<00:01:12.420> strategy<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.670> really

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
good strategy I think that will really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
good strategy I think that will really
help<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.240> skill<00:01:15.479> building<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
help your skill building because if you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.440 
help your skill building because if you
were<00:01:17.369> getting<00:01:17.640> killed<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.150> hit<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
were getting killed in one hit you're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
were getting killed in one hit you're
gonna<00:01:18.540> learn<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> enemy's<00:01:19.170> moves<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:20.189> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
gonna learn the enemy's moves better in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
gonna learn the enemy's moves better in
my<00:01:20.640> opinion<00:01:21.049> obviously<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.650> say

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
my opinion obviously as you could say

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
my opinion obviously as you could say
well<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> enemy<00:01:24.060> move<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
well you could see the enemy move and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
well you could see the enemy move and
get<00:01:24.659> hit<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.110> die<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.640> if

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
get hit and not die but I think that if

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
get hit and not die but I think that if
you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.570> you're<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> die<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you know that you're going to die you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.069 
you know that you're going to die you
get<00:01:28.470> hit<00:01:28.650> you'll<00:01:28.890> pay<00:01:29.220> more<00:01:29.400> attention<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
get hit you'll pay more attention and

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.880 
get hit you'll pay more attention and
it'll<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.409> still<00:01:31.680> building

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it'll just be more still building

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
it'll just be more still building
because<00:01:32.100> I've<00:01:32.310> been<00:01:32.579> playing<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.150> attack<00:01:33.420> for

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
because I've been playing all attack for

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.050 
because I've been playing all attack for
a<00:01:33.930> long<00:01:34.140> time<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.640> do

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
a long time now and I just I really do

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.940 
a long time now and I just I really do
think<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.470> works<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.369> works<00:01:41.430> better<00:01:41.880> so

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
think that it works it works better so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
think that it works it works better so
so<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> recommend<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.689> alright

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so I recommend that and so yeah alright

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.429 
so I recommend that and so yeah alright
so<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.950> third<00:01:50.460> tip<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.600> using

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so the third tip is going to be using

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
so the third tip is going to be using
your<00:01:52.799> money<00:01:53.040> effectively<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.390> that
