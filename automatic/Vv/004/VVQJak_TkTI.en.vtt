00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.569 
other uses for it I'm talking about ice

other uses for it I'm talking about ice
not<00:00:41.350> only<00:00:41.589> could<00:00:41.859> water<00:00:42.100> ice<00:00:42.370> be<00:00:42.579> beneficial

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
not only could water ice be beneficial

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.430 
not only could water ice be beneficial
to<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.239> production<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.809> both<00:00:44.019> water<00:00:44.289> and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
to the production of both water and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.889 
to the production of both water and
oxygen<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.639> could<00:00:45.789> aid<00:00:45.969> our<00:00:46.120> astronauts<00:00:46.690> as

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
oxygen that could aid our astronauts as

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.809 
oxygen that could aid our astronauts as
they<00:00:46.989> set<00:00:47.199> up<00:00:47.350> Luna<00:00:47.679> and<00:00:47.829> Martian<00:00:48.249> outposts

they set up Luna and Martian outposts

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.969 
they set up Luna and Martian outposts
but<00:00:49.300> by<00:00:49.449> studying<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.929> ice<00:00:50.139> a<00:00:50.440> lot<00:00:50.739> can<00:00:50.920> be

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
but by studying the ice a lot can be

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.649 
but by studying the ice a lot can be
learned<00:00:51.249> about<00:00:51.429> the<00:00:51.579> history<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:51.999> the<00:00:52.239> moon<00:00:52.420> or

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
learned about the history of the moon or

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.009 
learned about the history of the moon or
planets<00:00:53.199> how<00:00:54.010> well<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.210> answer<00:00:55.449> that<00:00:55.569> let's

butterfly tool to determine how thick it

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.219 
butterfly tool to determine how thick it
was<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.649> you<00:01:20.649> know<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.009> kind<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.280> tells<00:01:21.520> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
was and you know that kind of tells you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.139 
was and you know that kind of tells you
mentally<00:01:23.229> whether<00:01:24.100> your<00:01:24.340> chainsaw<00:01:24.609> is<00:01:24.880> long

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
mentally whether your chainsaw is long

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.240 
mentally whether your chainsaw is long
enough<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.570> cut<00:01:25.750> through<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.469> then<00:01:27.219> just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
enough to cut through it and then just

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.849 
enough to cut through it and then just
just<00:01:27.850> how<00:01:27.969> to<00:01:28.030> approach<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.600> we<00:01:29.049> were<00:01:29.229> cutting

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
just how to approach it we were cutting

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.289 
just how to approach it we were cutting
blocks<00:01:30.219> of<00:01:30.369> ice<00:01:30.490> out<00:01:30.729> from<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.090> lake<00:01:33.149> we<00:01:34.149> need

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
building thin sections and we use

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.539 
building thin sections and we use

correlate this with the weather records
all<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:08.210> this<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.840> decipher<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> history

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
all of this just to decipher the history

all of this just to decipher the history
of<00:02:09.800> winter<00:02:10.160> okay<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> things

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
of winter okay so one of the things

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.510 
of winter okay so one of the things
we're<00:02:12.380> talking<00:02:12.710> about<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.220> bubble

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
we're talking about is to bubble

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.670 
we're talking about is to bubble
structure<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.570> that's<00:02:15.020> something<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.410> can

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
structure now that's something that can

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.860 
structure now that's something that can
be<00:02:15.709> studied<00:02:16.040> pretty<00:02:16.310> easily<00:02:16.550> after<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.510> ice

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870

be studied pretty easily after all ice
is<00:02:18.140> transparent<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.490> just<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.730> matter<00:02:19.760> of

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
is transparent so it's just a matter of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.460 
is transparent so it's just a matter of
looking<00:02:20.209> at<00:02:20.450> whether<00:02:20.690> bubbles<00:02:21.080> are<00:02:21.170> formed

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
looking at whether bubbles are formed

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.520 
looking at whether bubbles are formed
but<00:02:22.459> what<00:02:22.700> does<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.970> tell<00:02:23.180> us<00:02:23.240> well<00:02:23.900> we'll

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
but what does that tell us well we'll

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.670 
but what does that tell us well we'll
let<00:02:24.620> Tony<00:02:24.890> explain<00:02:25.450> bubbles<00:02:26.560> tend<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
let Tony explain bubbles tend to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.140 
let Tony explain bubbles tend to
concentrate<00:02:27.830> during<00:02:28.370> periods<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.910> fast

concentrate during periods of fast
freezing<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.280> freezing<00:02:31.760> slows<00:02:32.030> down

bliss bubbly and on that basis you can

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.699 
bliss bubbly and on that basis you can
distinguish<00:02:37.850> what's<00:02:38.750> being<00:02:38.989> freezing<00:02:39.260> fast

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
distinguish what's being freezing fast

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.870 
distinguish what's being freezing fast
what's<00:02:40.550> been<00:02:40.790> freezing<00:02:41.390> slow<00:02:41.840> which<00:02:42.470> means

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
what's been freezing slow which means

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.940 
what's been freezing slow which means
what's<00:02:43.880> colder<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.540> what's<00:02:44.870> warmer<00:02:45.260> when<00:02:45.830> it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
what's colder and what's warmer when it

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.220 
what's colder and what's warmer when it
warmed<00:02:46.280> up<00:02:46.459> you'd<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:47.360> listed<00:02:47.720> by<00:02:47.780> balls<00:02:47.989> blow

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230

when it cooled down at night you've got
layers<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.410> more<00:02:51.620> bubbles<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.700> something<00:02:53.450> as

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
layers with more bubbles so something as

that's kind of like how you can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.860 
that's kind of like how you can

else tony was talking about was thin
sections<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.250> what<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.700> means<00:03:13.940> is

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
sections and what that means is

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.850 
sections and what that means is
basically<00:03:14.239> they're<00:03:14.930> taking<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> big<00:03:15.560> blocks

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860

ice block on top of a light table you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020 
ice block on top of a light table you

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
put a polarizer sheet on top of this go

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.729 
put a polarizer sheet on top of this go
to<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.299> section<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.230> on<00:03:36.350> top<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.709> ice

to the I section then on top of the ice

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.430 
to the I section then on top of the ice
you<00:03:37.160> put<00:03:37.340> another<00:03:37.549> polarizer<00:03:38.090> sheets<00:03:38.440> light

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you put another polarizer sheets light

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.050 
you put another polarizer sheets light
comes<00:03:39.620> through<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.950> polarizer<00:03:40.430> one<00:03:40.760> very

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
comes through the polarizer one very

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.199 
comes through the polarizer one very
narrow<00:03:41.360> vibration<00:03:41.900> direction<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:43.700> analyzer

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
absolutely normal to that direction so

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.560
