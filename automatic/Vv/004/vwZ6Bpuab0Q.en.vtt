 authentic body 10 so according to my 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.580
 point of view and is what I do the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.670
 we must include in all meals 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.370
 but that we do have to look for the best 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.990
 Protein protein of high quality and 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.960
 where is that protein for example 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.629
 in the animals that come from the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.380
 oceans like the squid one of my 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.829
 favorites 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.299
 a very high quality protein for 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.689
 prepare this dish you will need for 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.520
 supposedly a squid but also another 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.039
 series of things that I tell you already to 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.929
 then take good note as you 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.759
 I just said a squid more or less 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.159
 like this one and you can ask your 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.740
 Fishmonger who will clean it and cut it 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.020
 as you are watching and you will also have 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.200
 have a little bottle of parsley and another 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.200
 Ajos wants to say something very important 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.549
 extra virgin olive oil but as 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.369
 I already told you at the beginning of 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.590
 video something very special because it's not a 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.470
 Normal virgin olive oil is a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.450
 different special format because the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.119
 olive oil if we do not take it as 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.069
 I'm going to get fat and it's very 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.259
 important to include it in practically 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.970
 all our dishes because it's one of 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.729

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.420
 necessary not only to flavor 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.280
 our dishes but because we 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.709
