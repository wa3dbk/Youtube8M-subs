multiplayer<00:02:41.650> i<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> ps3<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
multiplayer i have it on the ps3 so the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.170 
multiplayer i have it on the ps3 so the
first<00:02:44.920> patch<00:02:45.310> if<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:46.090> ps3<00:02:46.480> may<00:02:47.080> have<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> bad

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
first patch if your ps3 may have a bad

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.880 
first patch if your ps3 may have a bad
first<00:02:49.180> patch<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:49.720> they<00:02:49.900> did<00:02:50.290> work<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.709> that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
first patch but they did work on that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.800 
first patch but they did work on that
and<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.280> there<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> new<00:02:52.000> patch<00:02:52.209> for<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.660> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and so there is a new patch for it and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.960 
and so there is a new patch for it and
it<00:02:52.930> doesn't<00:02:53.200> work<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.610> can<00:02:54.790> read

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
it doesn't work so then you can read

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180 
it doesn't work so then you can read
that<00:02:55.180> combine<00:02:55.870> both<00:02:56.230> super<00:02:56.709> strength<00:02:56.980> and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
strength that gives you additional
