door that works with it you have to read
the<00:00:20.970> description<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.630> find<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.199> patio

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
doors it works with but basically it has

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.290 
doors it works with but basically it has
a<00:00:26.820> twist<00:00:27.180> mechanism<00:00:28.010> when<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> twist<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.609> 90

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a twist mechanism when you twist it 90

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.319 
a twist mechanism when you twist it 90
degrees<00:00:30.330> it'll<00:00:31.170> either<00:00:31.349> stay<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> can

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
degrees it'll either stay out so you can

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.530 
degrees it'll either stay out so you can
slide<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> door<00:00:34.020> pass<00:00:34.890> both<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.850> tabs<00:00:38.540> or

slide the door pass both of the tabs or

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.920 
slide the door pass both of the tabs or
you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.290> keep<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.300> locked<00:00:42.649> completely<00:00:43.649> shut

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
you can keep it locked completely shut

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
you can keep it locked completely shut
or<00:00:45.930> slide<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
or slide it

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.380 
or slide it
just<00:00:49.200> slightly<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:51.380> let<00:00:52.380> me<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> lock<00:00:53.390> at

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just slightly over let me have a lock at

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
just slightly over let me have a lock at
three<00:00:54.780> inch<00:00:54.989> gap<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.700> three<00:00:57.090> inch<00:00:57.270> gap<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
three inch gap so the three inch gap in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.880 
three inch gap so the three inch gap in
our<00:00:57.930> door<00:00:58.520> as<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.350> probably<00:01:01.350> just

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
our door as you can see is probably just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030 
our door as you can see is probably just
enough<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> squeeze<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.640> arm<00:01:02.820> through<00:01:04.040> cats

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
enough to squeeze an arm through cats

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
enough to squeeze an arm through cats
and<00:01:05.280> dogs<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.759> get<00:01:06.000> through<00:01:06.240> their<00:01:06.479> bugs

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and dogs don't get through their bugs

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.460 
and dogs don't get through their bugs
obviously<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.550> screen<00:01:08.850> door<00:01:09.090> but

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
obviously do you on the screen door but

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
obviously do you on the screen door but
let's<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> let<00:01:11.100> pet<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.759> out<00:01:11.880> or

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
let's not have to let pet in and out or

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
let's not have to let pet in and out or
a<00:01:12.600> child<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.660> love<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.950> solves<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
a child so we love this it solves a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.590 
a child so we love this it solves a
problem<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:18.710> little<00:01:19.710> kids<00:01:19.950> getting<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.600> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
problem of little kids getting out it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
problem of little kids getting out it
does<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.910> thing<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.450> worried

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
does the one thing that I was worried

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
does the one thing that I was worried
about<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.410> first<00:01:25.649> looked<00:01:26.399> into<00:01:26.520> getting

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
about when we first looked into getting

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
about when we first looked into getting
it<00:01:27.149> was<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.289> be<00:01:28.410> able<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.649> lock

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it was would you be able to lock

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.960 
it was would you be able to lock
yourself<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> answer<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
yourself out and the answer to that is

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
yourself out and the answer to that is
potentially<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.210> probably<00:01:33.690> not<00:01:33.930> simply

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
potentially but probably not simply

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
potentially but probably not simply
because<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:35.970> set<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> an

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
because if you have it set so this is an

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
because if you have it set so this is an
ax<00:01:40.229> lock<00:01:40.440> position<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.310> an<00:01:41.490> unlock

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
ax lock position this is an unlock

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
ax lock position this is an unlock
position<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> unlocked

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
position if you have it in the unlocked

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
position if you have it in the unlocked
position<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.270> try<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> slide<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> door

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
position and you try to slide the door

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.120 
position and you try to slide the door
and<00:01:46.410> say<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.800> does<00:01:47.009> pop<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.869> lock<00:01:49.080> position

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and say it does pop in the lock position

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.820 
and say it does pop in the lock position
while<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.550> door<00:01:50.729> open<00:01:51.410> it'll<00:01:52.410> slide

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
while you have the door open it'll slide

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.630 
while you have the door open it'll slide
freely<00:01:53.819> and<00:01:54.119> then<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.319> catch<00:01:55.800> at<00:01:56.459> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
freely and then there is a catch at the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.469 
freely and then there is a catch at the
top<00:01:57.410> before<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.560> gets<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.190> lock<00:01:59.429> knobs<00:01:59.789> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
top before it gets to the lock knobs so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.109 
top before it gets to the lock knobs so
it's<00:02:00.690> not<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.140> lock<00:02:01.349> on<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.709> if<00:02:01.830> it's

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
it's not going to lock on you if it's

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.449 
it's not going to lock on you if it's
accidentally<00:02:03.679> snapped<00:02:04.679> into<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.250> lock

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
accidentally snapped into the lock

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.130 
accidentally snapped into the lock
position<00:02:05.700> while<00:02:06.179> you<00:02:06.300> have<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.569> open<00:02:06.929> as<00:02:07.110> long

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
position while you have it open as long

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.940 
position while you have it open as long
as<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.880> snapped<00:02:08.880> into<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> lock<00:02:09.539> position

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
as it's snapped into the lock position

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.520 
as it's snapped into the lock position
past<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:12.150> three<00:02:12.540> inch<00:02:12.720> gap<00:02:13.020> or<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.290> locked

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
past that three inch gap or the locked

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.729 
past that three inch gap or the locked
gap<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.360> yes<00:02:15.360> potentially<00:02:15.989> maybe<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.500> want<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
gap so yes potentially maybe you want to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.309 
gap so yes potentially maybe you want to
hide<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> key<00:02:17.190> outside<00:02:17.670> if<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.080> happen<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> do

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
hide a key outside if you happen to do

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.240 
hide a key outside if you happen to do
that<00:02:19.500> accidentally<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:22.040> probably<00:02:23.040> you're

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that accidentally but probably you're
