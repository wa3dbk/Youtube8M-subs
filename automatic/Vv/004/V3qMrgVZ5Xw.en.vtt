 hello friends about webinars 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.370
 who we have on saturday this week 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.940
 will be 10 am Moscow time 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.550
 I would like to remind that it will be just 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.590
 there are a couple of moments I mean now 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.450
 collect 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.980
 those who signed up for a webinar in a separate 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.900
 in a separate group on skype and i want 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.830
 warn that this group is not for 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.420
 communication live is a group for 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:42.920
 webinar notifications so there is no 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.920
 allowed no no under any circumstances 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.790
 let there message passed people this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.340
 everything there pops up they work their 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.590
 distracting they start unsubscribe this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.020
 as if breaking the rules of this group 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.880
 so if someone will be breaking me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.280
 I have to delete, I do not want anyone 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.989
 the remote just passed did not do that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.309
 how to understand that people at work you 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.850
 attracts it 1 moment 2 means when 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.119
 you want to join a group and in a group 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.399
 send a link to the webinar and for 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.040
 half an hour before the webinar starts so here in 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.410
 this group you write to me 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
 messages in skype up connect in 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.480
 skype on m tailors write a message to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 webinar upstairs so I know what it is about and 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:37.220
 I meet in this group but we have so 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.620
 I feel some number of connections 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 happened where there was no word on webinars 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.400
 that is, I see what I ask to include 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.330
 vkontakte me there I meet in contact 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.100
 and but in the summer several thousand people 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.080
 many people connect to me in skype 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.950
 for completely different reasons not 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.700
 associated with the webinar is quite large 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.680
 range of topics that we discuss therefore 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.150
 if you do not write on I choose you 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.729
 then the machine will not turn on 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 I can guess by indirect signs 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.470
 but you would not find so to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.780
 describe what if you sent the message but 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.209
 again on you but on you binar we are there on top 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.420
 did not write then you write because 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.360
 otherwise you wo n't be invited, and I 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.360
 I'll stop at some point 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.230
 i'm at some point there is no more 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.480
 connect people on running out very often 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.209
 it can be like that and we start everything 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280
 gathered and suddenly went some start 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.310
 people didn't get in 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.940
 I can not I am the same reservoir mind 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.860
 I have no opportunity therefore you 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 connect so let's say but at least minutes 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.769
 ten before the start here and then 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.400
 everything will be more or less normal otherwise 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.350
 otherwise fell out to look in the record 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.760
 because I can't take my mind off on 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.760
 it's all happy
