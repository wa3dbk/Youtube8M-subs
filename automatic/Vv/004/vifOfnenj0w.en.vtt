talking about how to set up a 2-d game

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.959 
talking about how to set up a 2-d game
or<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> set<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.320> 2-d<00:00:10.679> game<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:11.130> there's

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
or how I set my 2-d game up there's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.669 
or how I set my 2-d game up there's
plenty<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> tutorials<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:13.139> there<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.500> show

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
plenty of tutorials out there that show

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.810 
plenty of tutorials out there that show
how<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.160> it

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
how to do it

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.390 
how to do it
I<00:00:14.849> looked<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.410> was<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> beginner

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I looked at all of them I was a beginner

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.820 
I looked at all of them I was a beginner
when<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.699> started<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.900> project<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.470> couple<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
when I started this project a couple of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
when I started this project a couple of
weeks<00:00:19.949> ago<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.449> I've<00:00:21.570> set<00:00:21.810> mine

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
weeks ago but this is how I've set mine

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.099 
weeks ago but this is how I've set mine
up<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.529> took<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.400> everything

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
up I took a little bit from everything

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.779 
up I took a little bit from everything
the<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:25.320> thing<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.740> did<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.640> gonna

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the first thing that I did and I'm gonna

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.919 
the first thing that I did and I'm gonna
go<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.660> set<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> logic

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
go in here is I set up the I put a logic

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.600 
go in here is I set up the I put a logic
cube<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> world

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
cube here in the world

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.139 
cube here in the world
this<00:00:32.940> logic<00:00:33.180> cube<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.399> very

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this logic cube right here and it's very

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.810 
this logic cube right here and it's very
simple<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.690> I'll<00:00:37.140> show<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> i<00:00:37.710> named<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> logic

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
simple I I'll show you i named it logic

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.130 
simple I I'll show you i named it logic
cube<00:00:39.860> this<00:00:40.860> logic<00:00:41.370> cube<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:42.739> sets<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:45.140> axis

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
cube this logic cube just sets the axis

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
cube this logic cube just sets the axis
that<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.590> player<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.070> move<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that my player can move on back and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.670 
that my player can move on back and
forth<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.340> case<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> z-axis<00:00:51.680> axis

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
forth so in my case it's the z-axis axis

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680 
forth so in my case it's the z-axis axis
and<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:53.969> line<00:00:54.420> here

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and you can see the very first line here

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
and you can see the very first line here
says<00:00:55.020> position<00:00:55.559> Z<00:00:55.770> equals<00:00:56.340> logic<00:00:56.879> cube

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
says position Z equals logic cube

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569 
says position Z equals logic cube
position<00:00:57.840> Z<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.309> players

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
position Z and that's in my players

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.080 
position Z and that's in my players
brain<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.480> basically<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> z<00:01:02.399> axis<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
brain so basically the z axis and you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140 
brain so basically the z axis and you
can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
can see down here I have the the all of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
can see down here I have the the all of
my<00:01:06.299> camera<00:01:06.630> set<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> 270<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> makes<00:01:07.979> Z<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
my camera set to 270 that makes Z the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
my camera set to 270 that makes Z the
front<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.930> axis<00:01:10.670> X<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:12.060> left<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.630> Y

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
front to back axis X has left to right Y

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.340 
front to back axis X has left to right Y
is<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:14.070> by<00:01:15.030> setting<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.780> 270

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
is up and down by setting that to 270

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
is up and down by setting that to 270
that<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.159> makes<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.520> sense<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> me

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that that just makes more sense to me

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
that that just makes more sense to me
I've<00:01:18.240> always<00:01:18.630> learned<00:01:18.840> Z<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.470> left

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I've always learned Z was left

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.310 
I've always learned Z was left
our<00:01:19.950> X<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.640> left<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.240> while<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.170> up

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
our X was left and right while I was up

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
our X was left and right while I was up
and<00:01:22.439> down<00:01:22.590> Steve<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.100> front<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.580> that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and down Steve was front to back that's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
and down Steve was front to back that's
how<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> taught<00:01:24.330> math<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> set<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> up

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
how I was taught math so I set it up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.870 
how I was taught math so I set it up
just<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
just like that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 
just like that
it<00:01:27.060> keeps<00:01:27.360> East<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.650> west<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it keeps East to the right west to the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.109 
it keeps East to the right west to the
left<00:01:30.979> you'll<00:01:31.979> notice<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.759> line<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
left you'll notice that that line is

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.420 
left you'll notice that that line is
ignored<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.770> line<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.009> above

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
ignored because of this line right above

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.510 
ignored because of this line right above
it<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.150> says<00:01:36.329> once<00:01:36.689> attached<00:01:37.520> camera

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it where it says once attached camera

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.139 
it where it says once attached camera
control<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.799> socket<00:01:41.479> position<00:01:42.530> well<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.939> line

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
control to socket position well the line

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.600 
control to socket position well the line
below<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.470> line<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.310> this

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
below it is the same line that's in this

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
below it is the same line that's in this
logic<00:01:47.850> cube<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.360> I'll<00:01:48.420> show<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> right

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
logic cube and I'll show it to you right

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.260 
logic cube and I'll show it to you right
here<00:01:51.799> it's<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> same<00:01:53.310> line<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
here it's the same line and that's the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
only line in that logic cube right now

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
only line in that logic cube right now
and<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> reason<00:01:56.969> why<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.270> did<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> logic

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and the reason why I did it with a logic

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440 
and the reason why I did it with a logic
cube<00:01:58.290> instead<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.700> doing<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
cube instead of just doing it on a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
cube instead of just doing it on a
player's<00:02:00.689> brain<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.380> works<00:02:01.740> by<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> way

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
player's brain which works by the way

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.310 
player's brain which works by the way
you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.719> players<00:02:03.930> brain

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you can put in the in the players brain

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.090 
you can put in the in the players brain
but<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> switch<00:02:06.030> from<00:02:06.799> player<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
but it's because I switch from player to

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.030 
but it's because I switch from player to
I<00:02:10.050> transform<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.200> my<00:02:11.320> game<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.740> switch<00:02:12.010> from

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
I transform in my game I switch from

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.240 
I transform in my game I switch from
different<00:02:12.580> players<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.900> animals<00:02:14.770> all<00:02:15.010> kinds

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
different players to animals all kinds

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
different players to animals all kinds
of<00:02:15.280> different<00:02:15.460> things<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.960> had<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.560> go

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
of different things and if I had to go

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
of different things and if I had to go
in<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.190> modify<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.910> each<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> their

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
in and modify it in each one of their

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.780 
in and modify it in each one of their
brains<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.620> would<00:02:20.770> be<00:02:20.920> kind<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.220> annoying<00:02:21.460> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
brains that would be kind of annoying so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.060 
brains that would be kind of annoying so
I<00:02:21.850> have<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> setup<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> logic<00:02:23.110> cube<00:02:23.350> where<00:02:24.040> I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
I have a setup to a logic cube where I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.850 
I have a setup to a logic cube where I
can<00:02:24.310> modify<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.360> spot<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:26.290> also<00:02:26.470> will

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
can modify it in one spot it also will

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.440 
can modify it in one spot it also will
allow<00:02:26.890> me<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.400> things<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.760> use<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.240> right

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
allow me to do things like use the right

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.620 
allow me to do things like use the right
stick<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.990> control<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.590> camera<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.240> want<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
stick to control the camera if I want to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.780 
stick to control the camera if I want to
scroll<00:02:32.230> down<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> little<00:02:32.710> bit<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.220> scroll<00:02:33.520> up<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
scroll down a little bit or scroll up a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.820 
scroll down a little bit or scroll up a
little<00:02:33.940> bit<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.360> zoom<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.960> out<00:02:35.080> I'll<00:02:35.650> be

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
little bit or zoom in and out I'll be

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.350 
little bit or zoom in and out I'll be
able<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> use<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.340> right<00:02:36.550> stick<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.150> that

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
able to use the right stick to do that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.720 
able to use the right stick to do that
and<00:02:38.170> only<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.710> modify<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.280> one<00:02:39.460> spot

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
and only have to modify it in one spot

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.420 
and only have to modify it in one spot
which<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.300> what's<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.530> good<00:02:41.830> about<00:02:41.860> using

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
which is what's really good about using

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.040 
which is what's really good about using
the<00:02:42.520> logic<00:02:42.880> cubes<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.420> game<00:02:43.570> instead<00:02:43.930> of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
the logic cubes in a game instead of

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.530 
the logic cubes in a game instead of
duplicating<00:02:45.040> code<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.030> multiple<00:02:46.600> brains<00:02:47.250> I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
duplicating code in multiple brains I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.760 
duplicating code in multiple brains I
had<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.050> quick<00:02:50.110> those<00:02:50.500> crows

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
had to get out of it quick those crows

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.520 
had to get out of it quick those crows
we're<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.250> get<00:02:51.370> me<00:02:51.570> let's<00:02:52.570> see<00:02:52.870> I'm

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
we're about to get me let's see I'm

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.640 
we're about to get me let's see I'm
gonna<00:02:53.800> show<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.510> enemy<00:02:55.510> brains<00:02:55.990> now<00:02:56.260> you've

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
gonna show the enemy brains now you've

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.250 
gonna show the enemy brains now you've
seen<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:58.120> camera<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:59.050> saw

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
seen that I have the camera and you saw

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
seen that I have the camera and you saw
that<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.500> locked<00:03:00.100> everybody<00:03:00.370> into<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> z-axis

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that I locked everybody into a z-axis

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.650 
that I locked everybody into a z-axis
while<00:03:02.080> enemies<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.250> line

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
while enemies I have that same line

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.690 
while enemies I have that same line
position<00:03:04.660> Z<00:03:04.870> equals<00:03:05.470> logic<00:03:05.980> cube<00:03:06.220> position

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
position Z equals logic cube position

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.590 
position Z equals logic cube position
see<00:03:06.910> that's<00:03:07.630> got<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> be<00:03:08.170> inside<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.890> brain<00:03:09.190> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
see that's got to be inside the brain of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.420 
see that's got to be inside the brain of
everything<00:03:10.600> in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.080> game<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.860> want<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
everything in the game if you want it to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.660 
everything in the game if you want it to
be<00:03:12.520> locked<00:03:12.820> into<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.240> 2d<00:03:13.690> plane<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:15.310> you've

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
be locked into that 2d plane if you've

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.160 
be locked into that 2d plane if you've
watched<00:03:15.940> some<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.300> other<00:03:16.420> tutorials<00:03:17.020> you

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
watched some of the other tutorials you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.160 
watched some of the other tutorials you
may<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.980> position<00:03:18.610> x<00:03:18.850> equals<00:03:19.570> logic

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
may see that as position x equals logic

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.570 
may see that as position x equals logic
cube<00:03:20.410> position<00:03:20.950> X<00:03:21.190> or<00:03:21.790> something<00:03:22.780> else<00:03:23.580> again

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
cube position X or something else again

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.880 
cube position X or something else again
that's<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.390> have<00:03:25.570> my<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.380> camera<00:03:26.710> set

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
that's because I have my that camera set

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.550 
that's because I have my that camera set
at<00:03:26.980> 270<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.580> wanted<00:03:27.880> X<00:03:28.120> left<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.600> right<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
at 270 I wanted X left and right and I

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.730 
at 270 I wanted X left and right and I
wanted<00:03:29.920> Y<00:03:30.580> up<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.150> down<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.750> wanted<00:03:32.050> C<00:03:32.350> back

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
wanted Y up and down and I wanted C back

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.360 
wanted Y up and down and I wanted C back
and<00:03:32.950> forth<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:34.080> don't<00:03:35.080> want<00:03:35.350> North<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.100> right

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
and forth I don't want North to be right

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
and forth I don't want North to be right
I<00:03:36.580> want<00:03:36.880> East<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.360> be<00:03:37.480> right<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:37.900> makes

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
I want East to be right it just makes

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.120 
I want East to be right it just makes
more<00:03:38.440> sense<00:03:38.740> to<00:03:38.920> me<00:03:39.600> anyway<00:03:40.600> that's<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
more sense to me anyway that's the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.040 
more sense to me anyway that's the
breakdown<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.910> things<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.420> have<00:03:43.690> why

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
breakdown of the things that I have why

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.560 
breakdown of the things that I have why
I<00:03:44.080> have
