00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
channel alright nothing too tricky about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
channel alright nothing too tricky about
these<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.519> basically<00:00:27.890> all<00:00:28.890> blue<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
these is just basically all blue on the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.160 
these is just basically all blue on the
base<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.730> when<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> apply<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> certain<00:00:33.989> amount

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
base and when you apply a certain amount

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
base and when you apply a certain amount
of<00:00:34.260> heat<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:35.329> 86<00:00:36.329> degrees<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.870> it's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of heat I think about 86 degrees so it's

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.920 
of heat I think about 86 degrees so it's
really<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> summertime<00:00:37.559> shoe<00:00:38.300> it'll<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
really a summertime shoe it'll go all

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
really a summertime shoe it'll go all
clear<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> under<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> blue<00:00:41.910> paint<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.510> all

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
clear and under the blue paint it's all

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.799 
clear and under the blue paint it's all
white<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:44.180> showed<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> guys<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
white so I showed you guys that in a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.520 
white so I showed you guys that in a
second<00:00:47.329> alright<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> applied

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
second alright as you can see I applied

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
second alright as you can see I applied
heat<00:00:50.010> onto<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.879> other<00:00:51.030> shoe<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> why<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
heat onto the other shoe which is why I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
heat onto the other shoe which is why I
turn<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.770> white<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> same<00:00:53.910> shoe

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
turn all white and that is the same shoe

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
turn all white and that is the same shoe
that<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.719> before<00:00:55.309> she<00:00:56.309> goes<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that was just a before she goes down the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.650 
that was just a before she goes down the
second<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.730> use<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> heat<00:01:00.090> gun<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
second so I use the heat gun to kind of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
second so I use the heat gun to kind of
speed<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> process<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
speed up the process but um when you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.050 
speed up the process but um when you
apply<00:01:03.120> heat<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> blue<00:01:05.129> paint<00:01:05.400> goes

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
apply heat on it the blue paint goes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
apply heat on it the blue paint goes
clear<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.140> paint<00:01:07.409> at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> bottom<00:01:07.950> bullet

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
clear and I paint at the bottom bullet
in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> base<00:01:08.729> white<00:01:09.140> this<00:01:10.140> base<00:01:10.380> color<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.770> be

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

change<00:01:18.330> paint<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.619> goes<00:01:19.860> clear<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.310> heat

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
change paint which goes clear on heat

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.210 
change paint which goes clear on heat
and<00:01:20.869> again<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> use<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> heat<00:01:22.500> gun<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.890> speed<00:01:23.130> up

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and again I use the heat gun to speed up

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.289 
and again I use the heat gun to speed up
the<00:01:23.280> process<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> were<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> go

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the process but if you were to go

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.200 
the process but if you were to go
