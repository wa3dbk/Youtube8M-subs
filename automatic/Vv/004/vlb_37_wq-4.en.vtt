00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.330
 to prepare what are being some 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.889
 alioli potatoes good more than potatoes 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.660
 I will show you out what is sauce 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.590
 because potatoes are very easy to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 prepare the three to make fried or cooked 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 normally the traditional way is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.759
 cooked what to do I'm going to do 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 fried so I thought I was preparing the 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.920
 alioli sauce and so you can use it in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.130
 many sandwiches many meals 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.050
 serves for many things the truth and for 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.930
 a race band for example with airplane and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.930
 very rich and nothing right now I teach it 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.010
 for this we will need garlic an egg 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.520
 oil parsley and salt and potatoes 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.410
 birds I have no chips worth 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.630
 that as I said 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.489
 the truth is the aioli is with cooked potato 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.760
 but lately it's done much more with 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.219
 maternal potatoes served 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.360
 and you also have a little bit of 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.160
 Salt 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.010
 what I forgot was also thrown at him 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.020
 lemon or if not lemon you can use 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.690
 vinegar this part you have to have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 careful because then if I bati you can 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.620
 cut what's wrong with mayonnaise 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 with the aioli then now what 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.890
 let's do is beat it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.750
 this is very easy we put the blender to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 bottom of the whole and without lifting 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.290
 but as you see it and we cast 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.009
 Now what we are going to do now is add 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.820
 the parsley will clean 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.190
 the pot of the blender and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.670
 we will throw the parsley and with a spoon 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.670
 we will move it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.890
 As you can see it is very easy but very very 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.890
 very easy 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.380
 and it's very good you have to try it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.230
 good and as you will see is the presentation 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.819
 of my potatoes alioli the truth that the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.770
 Alioli potatoes are very easy to make 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.660
 but what has been the potato is 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 super easy what you have to learn is 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.060
 to make the sauce and the only problem that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.400
 it has is that you can cut it but 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.860
 good practice makes the master I hope 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.600
 that you like the recipe that you share 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.110
 that you subscribe to 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.300
 and if you see it on twitter or see it on 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610
 youtube depending if you see it in 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.030
 twitter in case you can retweet it and if 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.319
 not so the little hand up 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.849
 good and I leave you 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.769

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.349
 upload the videos but all the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.230
 weeks to climb to the best if not the 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.090
 there were volumes on Sunday and nothing 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.159
