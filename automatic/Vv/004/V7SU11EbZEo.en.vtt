here we're gonna see with the basic tab

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.040 
here we're gonna see with the basic tab
test<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:13.050> we've<00:02:13.260> got<00:02:14.180> obviously<00:02:15.180> there's<00:02:15.840> no

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540 
chlorine the pH and the toca Latin total
alkalinity<00:02:21.810> looked<00:02:22.410> pretty<00:02:22.620> good<00:02:25.550> well

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550

later<00:02:29.239> as<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.200> water<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.800> nice

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
later as you can see the water is nice

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.350 
later as you can see the water is nice
and<00:02:32.160> clear<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:34.410> staining<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.430> obvious<00:02:35.940> but

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and clear the staining is obvious but

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780

I've rubbed it and obviously the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.870 
I've rubbed it and obviously the
staining<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.540> come<00:02:39.780> off<00:02:40.019> with<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.880> scouring

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
staining can come off with a scouring

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.170 
staining can come off with a scouring
pad<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:42.870> somebody<00:02:43.290> wanted<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.250> the

see<00:02:58.920> all<00:02:59.430> the<00:03:00.260> buildup<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.030> aluminum<00:03:03.030> from

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
see all the buildup on the aluminum from

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.710 
see all the buildup on the aluminum from
sitting<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> pool<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.799> eight<00:03:04.950> years
