Cove Johnson what do you think of this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.450 
Cove Johnson what do you think of this
fight<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.909> think<00:01:27.200> Dawson<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.350> too<00:01:29.220> young

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
fight and I think Dawson is too young

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.350 
fight and I think Dawson is too young
too<00:01:30.240> smart<00:01:30.720> too<00:01:31.710> fast<00:01:32.010> for<00:01:32.250> him<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.880> boxing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
too smart too fast for him but in boxing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
too smart too fast for him but in boxing
we<00:01:33.690> never<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> can't<00:01:35.220> happen<00:01:35.370> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
we never know what do I can't happen so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
we never know what do I can't happen so
surely<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.870> way<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.380> close

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
surely the first way it was so close

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
surely the first way it was so close
exactly<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:40.100> Dawson<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.400> smart

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
exactly but because Dawson is a smart

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460 
exactly but because Dawson is a smart
fighter<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.330> things<00:01:42.690> is<00:01:42.900> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> address

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
fighter and things is going to address

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.340 
fighter and things is going to address
itself<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.970> second<00:01:45.360> fat<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.990> easier

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
itself and the second fat will be easier

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.859 
itself and the second fat will be easier
for<00:01:46.380> him<00:01:46.650> so<00:01:47.250> your<00:01:47.460> branco<00:01:47.940> talk<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.479> me<00:01:48.600> what
