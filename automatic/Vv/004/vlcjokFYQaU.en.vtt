a diamond making machine on take it this

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.360 
a diamond making machine on take it this
is<00:00:10.710> very<00:00:11.250> very<00:00:12.090> very<00:00:12.719> useful<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.440> Tekkit<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
is very very very useful on Tekkit and I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640 
is very very very useful on Tekkit and I
do<00:00:14.429> advise<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> save<00:00:16.170> mostly

do advise you to do this and save mostly

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.050 
do advise you to do this and save mostly
a<00:00:16.710> diamond<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.460> believe<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> or<00:00:17.940> not

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
a diamond to do it believe it or not

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
a diamond to do it believe it or not
because<00:00:18.830> what<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> thought<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.460> thought

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
because what I thought first thought

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.220 
because what I thought first thought
about<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.449> no<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> know<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.199> not

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
about it I was like no you know I'm not

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.720 
about it I was like no you know I'm not
gonna<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> waste<00:00:23.609> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
gonna do it that's gonna be a waste of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.750 
gonna do it that's gonna be a waste of
diamond<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> done<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
diamond but then I done it and well just

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349 
diamond but then I done it and well just
just<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.689> alright<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.949> I'll<00:00:29.609> give<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> a

just well alright so I'll give you a
look<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:31.980> I'm<00:00:32.099> built<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
look at it as you can see I'm built this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160 
look at it as you can see I'm built this
little<00:00:32.640> building<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
little building but it's not the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.630 
little building but it's not the
building<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> doesn't<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> thing

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
building that doesn't it's the thing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.930 
building that doesn't it's the thing
inside<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.829> this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.370> diary<00:00:38.550> making

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
inside it this is your diary making

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
inside it this is your diary making
machine<00:00:39.300> covered<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.750> clothes<00:00:39.930> stone<00:00:40.200> gives

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
machine covered in clothes stone gives

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.490 
machine covered in clothes stone gives
it<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.340> light<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> makes<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> generate

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it more light off and makes it generate

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
it more light off and makes it generate
more<00:00:43.649> diamond<00:00:44.010> quicker<00:00:44.660> these<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:45.989> in

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
more diamond quicker these things in

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
more diamond quicker these things in
here<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.070> called<00:00:47.550> red<00:00:48.539> matter<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> what

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
here these are called red matter so what

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.270 
here these are called red matter so what
they<00:00:57.809> call<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:59.809> there<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:00.870> are

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
they call now they are there they are

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
they call now they are there they are
they're<00:01:02.280> called<00:01:02.640> collectors<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
they're called collectors all right you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
they're called collectors all right you
start<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.350> an<00:01:04.470> energy<00:01:04.589> collector<00:01:05.220> which

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
start off with an energy collector which

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.550 
start off with an energy collector which
is<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.880> easy<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> make<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is very easy to make as you can see just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
is very easy to make as you can see just
like<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.830> piece<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.939> diamond<00:01:09.090> block<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
like that piece of diamond block in the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
like that piece of diamond block in the
middle<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
middle and around like that and with a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
middle and around like that and with a
furnace<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.560> they're<00:01:13.710> pretty<00:01:13.950> easy<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.430> make

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
furnace so they're pretty easy to make

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
furnace so they're pretty easy to make
but<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> greatly<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:16.320> am<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:16.860> having

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
but then you greatly do am up by having

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
but then you greatly do am up by having
more<00:01:17.340> glowstone<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.150> energy<00:01:18.509> collect<00:01:18.750> I've

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
more glowstone with energy collect I've

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
more glowstone with energy collect I've
and<00:01:19.140> dark<00:01:19.350> matter<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> again

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and dark matter and then you do it again

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
and dark matter and then you do it again
with<00:01:21.330> red<00:01:21.509> matter<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.090> what

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
with red matter like that so that's what

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
with red matter like that so that's what
I<00:01:24.299> did<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.869> I've<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.619> lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I did and I've got a lot of them then in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
I did and I've got a lot of them then in
the<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:27.150> inside<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.840> middle<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the thing inside the middle here is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.480 
the thing inside the middle here is
called<00:01:29.040> an<00:01:29.130> energy<00:01:29.520> condenser<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.280> what

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
called an energy condenser this is what

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
called an energy condenser this is what
makes<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.659> diamond<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> put<00:01:34.470> your

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
makes your diamond do you put your

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
makes your diamond do you put your
diamond<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.090> generate

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
diamond in here and it will generate

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
diamond in here and it will generate
your<00:01:36.509> diamond<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.770> lot

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
your diamond as you can see I have a lot

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
your diamond as you can see I have a lot
of<00:01:38.070> diamond<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.210> been<00:01:39.450> generated<00:01:40.020> by

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
of diamond that is all been generated by

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.760 
of diamond that is all been generated by
this<00:01:40.920> machine<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.540> usually<00:01:42.659> takes<00:01:43.170> around

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this machine and it usually takes around

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
this machine and it usually takes around
about<00:01:46.040> under<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> minute<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.729> sure<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
about under a minute for sure to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.399 
about under a minute for sure to
generate<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:49.049> diamond<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> yeah<00:01:51.320> what<00:01:52.320> else

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
generate one diamond so yeah what else

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
generate one diamond so yeah what else
is<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:52.890> needs<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.149> heat<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
is there needs to be on heat there is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.010 
is there needs to be on heat there is
also<00:01:55.229> realize<00:01:56.030> these<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> things<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
also realize these are the things that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.639 
also realize these are the things that
arm<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.560> put<00:01:58.740> around<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.610> chest<00:02:00.649> your

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
arm you put around your chest your

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.030 
arm you put around your chest your
energy<00:02:02.280> energy<00:02:02.820> condenser<00:02:03.719> chest<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.290> then

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
energy energy condenser chest and then

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.730 
energy energy condenser chest and then
you<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.360> relays<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you put these relays around it that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.580 
you put these relays around it that
generates<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.420> heap<00:02:10.080> sort<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
generates more like heap sort of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.610 
generates more like heap sort of
sunlight<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.629> able<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> bit<00:02:13.110> forced

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
sunlight to be able to bit forced

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.420 
sunlight to be able to bit forced
to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.510> energy<00:02:15.930> convince<00:02:16.290> off<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:17.280> ya

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to the to the energy convince off see ya

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.520 
to the to the energy convince off see ya
say<00:02:18.120> I'll<00:02:18.629> show<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.930> how<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> build<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.500> of

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
say I'll show you how to build one of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.740 
say I'll show you how to build one of
these<00:02:19.620> next<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:20.849> on<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> test<00:02:21.269> world<00:02:21.540> right

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
these next so I'm on a test world right

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.420 
these next so I'm on a test world right
now<00:02:21.780> I'm<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.830> show<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.010> how<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> build

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
now I'm just to show you how to build

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.960 
now I'm just to show you how to build
this<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.530> you've<00:02:25.830> got<00:02:26.099> what<00:02:26.819> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
this so as you see you've got what you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:36.350 
this so as you see you've got what you
do<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:29.099> have<00:02:30.260> closed<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:35.360> energy

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
do right you have closed down energy

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.360 
do right you have closed down energy
left<00:02:36.959> oh<00:02:38.040> my<00:02:38.280> bad<00:02:40.159> how<00:02:41.159> did<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
left oh my bad how did you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.440 
left oh my bad how did you
collector<00:02:41.730> there<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.379> have<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.610> relay

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
collector there then you have the relay

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:54.369 
collector there then you have the relay
there<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.040> chest<00:02:49.819> another<00:02:50.819> relay<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
there in your chest another relay and

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.099 
there in your chest another relay and
another<00:02:55.379> collector<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.629> then<00:02:57.629> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> glove

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
another collector and then on the glove

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:11.330 
another collector and then on the glove
side<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:10.260> realize<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.129> side

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
side like that to realize on the side

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.470 
side like that to realize on the side
like<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.799> surround<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.859> fire<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.359> you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
like that surround a fire and if you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.129 
like that surround a fire and if you
commit<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.139> G<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.370> that's<00:03:20.519> how<00:03:20.669> you

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
commit so that G and that's how you

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.229 
commit so that G and that's how you
there<00:03:22.139> there<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:22.549> then<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.209> another

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
there there there then you have another

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:32.270 
there there there then you have another
lucky<00:03:26.150> d<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.879> it's<00:03:30.000> surrounded<00:03:31.280> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
lucky d like that so it's surrounded and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.890 
lucky d like that so it's surrounded and
when<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.579> do<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.879> back<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.629> do<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> same

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
when you do at the back you do the same

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.740 
when you do at the back you do the same
thing<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:36.000> there<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:38.930> another<00:03:39.930> rely<00:03:40.349> he<00:03:41.750> look

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
thing is there then another rely he look

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.309 
thing is there then another rely he look
at<00:03:42.870> them<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.169> that

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
at them to that

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.809 
at them to that
and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.950> I'll<00:03:45.069> when<00:03:45.189> you<00:03:45.280> close<00:03:45.489> down<00:03:45.519> it

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
and then I'll when you close down it

00:03:45.819 --> 00:04:23.800 
and then I'll when you close down it
around

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.250 

you<00:04:24.810> won't<00:04:24.960> have<00:04:25.050> another<00:04:26.870> another<00:04:27.870> lot<00:04:28.140> of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
you won't have another another lot of

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.250 
you won't have another another lot of
energy<00:04:28.530> collectors<00:04:29.100> there<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.810> go<00:04:30.990> stone

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
energy collectors there and go stone

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.470 
energy collectors there and go stone
around<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.710> as<00:04:31.800> well<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:33.000> reason<00:04:33.300> why<00:04:33.419> you

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
around that as well the reason why you

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.909 
around that as well the reason why you
want<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.720> leave<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.960> part<00:04:34.260> out<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:34.830> you

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
want to leave this part out is so you

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.480 
want to leave this part out is so you
can<00:04:35.100> see<00:04:35.340> when<00:04:36.030> you've<00:04:36.300> um<00:04:36.980> see<00:04:37.980> inside<00:04:38.340> up

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
can see when you've um see inside up

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.400 
can see when you've um see inside up
when<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.790> gets<00:04:38.940> built<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.480> then<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.140> put<00:04:40.290> your

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
when it gets built and then you put your

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.170 
when it gets built and then you put your
diamond<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:42.919> yeah<00:04:43.919> that's<00:04:44.100> basically<00:04:44.580> how

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
diamond do it yeah that's basically how

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.500 
diamond do it yeah that's basically how
you<00:04:45.440> build<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:47.370> easiest<00:04:48.270> one<00:04:48.390> anyway<00:04:50.510> just

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
you build the easiest one anyway just

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.980 
you build the easiest one anyway just
like<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:54.890> as<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:55.980> can<00:04:56.070> see<00:04:56.450> is<00:04:57.450> generating

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
like that as you can see is generating

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.290 
like that as you can see is generating
the<00:04:58.080> diamond<00:04:58.440> very<00:04:58.650> very<00:04:58.950> slowly<00:04:59.250> as<00:04:59.550> you<00:05:00.090> do

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
the diamond very very slowly as you do

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.390 
the diamond very very slowly as you do
need<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.510> upgrade<00:05:00.750> your<00:05:01.080> machines<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:02.130> best

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
need to upgrade your machines the best

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.940 
need to upgrade your machines the best
obviously<00:05:03.390> red<00:05:03.840> matter<00:05:04.080> i'll<00:05:04.410> build<00:05:04.740> one<00:05:04.919> of

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
obviously red matter i'll build one of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.200 
obviously red matter i'll build one of
them<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:07.440> keep<00:05:08.280> in<00:05:08.400> mind<00:05:08.580> as<00:05:08.700> well<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.030> needs

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
them and keep in mind as well it needs

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:18.080 
them and keep in mind as well it needs
to<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.390> daytime<00:05:09.980> for<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:14.780> where<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:17.090> sorry

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
to be daytime for the where is it sorry

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.380 
to be daytime for the where is it sorry
to<00:05:18.330> generate<00:05:18.780> more<00:05:18.930> diamond<00:05:19.320> quickly<00:05:20.330> do<00:05:21.330> it

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
to generate more diamond quickly do it

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.950 
to generate more diamond quickly do it
again<00:05:21.630> yeah<00:05:22.760> gross<00:05:23.760> down<00:05:25.280> relay<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:27.300> like<00:05:27.570> my

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
again yeah gross down relay just like my

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.110 
again yeah gross down relay just like my
bat<00:05:28.140> take<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.070> way<00:05:29.220> that's<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:30.290> first<00:05:31.290> stone

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
bat take the way that's it first stone

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.300 
bat take the way that's it first stone
collector

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.950 

weird<00:05:36.310> like<00:05:37.800> chess<00:05:40.259> real-life<00:05:41.259> dead<00:05:42.960> saw

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
weird like chess real-life dead saw

00:05:43.960 --> 00:07:15.480 
weird like chess real-life dead saw
clear<00:05:44.889> sir<00:05:50.639> really<00:05:52.350> that's<00:05:53.350> all

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.270 

now<00:07:16.490> as<00:07:16.610> you<00:07:16.669> can<00:07:16.819> see<00:07:16.880> here<00:07:17.710> your<00:07:18.710> diamond<00:07:19.190> is

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280
