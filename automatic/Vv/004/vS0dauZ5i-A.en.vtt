00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
spinning thing I don't know I got it I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
spinning thing I don't know I got it I
was<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.140> hey<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.530> could<00:00:46.680> spin<00:00:46.950> some<00:00:47.219> stuff

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
was like hey we could spin some stuff

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
was like hey we could spin some stuff
right<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:49.640> here<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.180> looks<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
right so here is what it looks like in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
right so here is what it looks like in
front<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.949> day<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.370> edition<00:00:53.550> as

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
front and this is the day one edition as

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
front and this is the day one edition as
it<00:00:54.059> says<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.170> turn<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> around<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.920> bit

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it says there and turn it around a bit

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
it says there and turn it around a bit
let's<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.360> been

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
let's see what we can get in here been

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
let's see what we can get in here been
actually<00:00:58.109> trying<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.100> closer<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.609> bit

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
actually trying to get this closer a bit

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
actually trying to get this closer a bit
so<00:01:00.180> hopefully<00:01:00.570> you'll<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> able<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so hopefully you'll be able to get a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.149 
so hopefully you'll be able to get a
good<00:01:01.649> view<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.960> light<00:01:04.650> does<00:01:04.680> stop

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
good view of it if the light does stop

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
good view of it if the light does stop
reflecting<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> stock<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.170> hopefully

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
reflecting the stock all right hopefully

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
reflecting the stock all right hopefully
it<00:01:08.369> focuses<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> yeah<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> doesn't<00:01:10.320> look<00:01:10.470> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it focuses and yeah it doesn't look like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.070 
it focuses and yeah it doesn't look like
it's<00:01:10.860> focusing<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's focusing you know that's that's the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's focusing you know that's that's the
bad<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> zoom<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:14.970> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bad thing so I got a zoom out a bit we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
bad thing so I got a zoom out a bit we
don't<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.630> exactly<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> super<00:01:16.650> camera<00:01:17.009> that's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
don't have exactly a super camera that's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
don't have exactly a super camera that's
why<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.640> should<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.360> rip<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.570> apart<00:01:18.750> first

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
why I should just rip it apart first

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.999 
why I should just rip it apart first
then<00:01:19.590> maybe<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.520> glare<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.479> stop

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
then maybe the glare will stop

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
then maybe the glare will stop
reflecting<00:01:23.009> off<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:27.380> plastic

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
reflecting off the game or the plastic

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.420 
reflecting off the game or the plastic
rather<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
rather so here it is and this is what it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.830 
rather so here it is and this is what it
looks<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:34.700> hopefully<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.570> good

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
looks like hopefully we can get a good

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
looks like hopefully we can get a good
view<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.680> gonna<00:01:37.890> try<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> zoom<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
view in there I'm gonna try to zoom in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
view in there I'm gonna try to zoom in
instead<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.509> putting<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.930> closer

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
instead of actually putting it closer

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
instead of actually putting it closer
maybe<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.430> zoom<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
maybe if we zoom in like that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.920 
maybe if we zoom in like that
alright<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:44.240> essentially<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> says<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
alright so essentially it says at the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
alright so essentially it says at the
top<00:01:46.110> create<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.680> own<00:01:46.710> saying<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> restored

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
top create your own saying and restored

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.080 
top create your own saying and restored
your<00:01:47.970> Dragonball<00:01:48.649> history<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.890> did<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.909> any
