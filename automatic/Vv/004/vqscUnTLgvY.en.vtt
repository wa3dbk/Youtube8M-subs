thought this would have been a little

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.699 
thought this would have been a little

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
closer than the score board indicates

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.130 
closer than the score board indicates
maybe<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.760> says<00:03:06.030> something<00:03:06.330> about<00:03:06.569> how<00:03:06.900> good

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
maybe that says something about how good

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.830 
maybe that says something about how good
a<00:03:07.200> game<00:03:07.440> they<00:03:07.650> play<00:03:07.920> Oklahoma<00:03:08.879> State<00:03:09.569> could

a game they play Oklahoma State could

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.600 
a game they play Oklahoma State could
