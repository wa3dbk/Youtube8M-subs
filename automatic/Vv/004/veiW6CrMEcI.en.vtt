00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello all and all to kiss up and good 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.350
 we are again my channel in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.350
 this time I bring you a tutorial voucher 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.810
 that I mentioned in the previous video that 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.160
 good will serve to decrease the lag 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.470
 both on your computer and our 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.570
 computer video games worth 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.869
 it's a pretty useful program 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.400
 it is called here in booster vale I leave you the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.730
 link in the description to download it in 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.550
 mediafire vale is this the link then 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.600
 well once you have lowered it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.840
 we just have to open it up 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.329
 from run is install right here 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.120
 ok and you will download this folder with 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 with the installer, the competition is worth 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.469
 makin booster 3 set up ok then this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.469
 I load you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 next you know what's always worth 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.199
 I'm not going to install that I already have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 installed then it is worth once 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 I'm going to show you both 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.629
 ways to use this program one of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 them is in case you want to play 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.840
 a game so that we go so die 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.369
 because for example I have a computer 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 with very little cpu and very little 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.590
 processor is good so well then 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.140
 the program the problem is that not me 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 also having cpu ram and all that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 I'm pretty swimmers most of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.210
 the games even in minecraft I 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.470
 It seems like a bullshit but it's going 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.039
 very good side then this is the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.110
 main window is then worth what 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.690
 makes this program this program what 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.310
 it does is close secondary processes 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.420
 of the computer worth there are hundreds of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.130
 processes that are now being 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 running on the computer some that do not 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.460
 they matter that they are nothing important 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.820
 you take off ram 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.440
 that they take away rahm and others that are more 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.990
 important that those do not close them 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.659
 so here you have good then 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.340
 for fps in case you want to do any 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.530
 thing is worth the truth is that this has not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.240
 touched nothing as it came according to how 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.729
 used then ok well I'm going to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.259
 teach first to use it 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.660
 in the games ok first have good power 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.130
 configure this what you want is worth here 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.630
 comes to you in the processes you see how 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.160
 was saying processes that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.260
 recommends doing at the same time these two are 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.870
 those that are recommended and well these are 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.269
 so what I use what the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.489
 unnecessary the necessary is worth three the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.230
 half of these does not eliminate them 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.360
 but it stops them for a while until 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.530
 you get out of the program again 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.720
 then you give add to vale 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.720
 and on your desktop for example 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.730
 to choose the direct access is worth not 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.010
 there would be none because we have 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.770
 say you choose the shortcut is worth it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.180
 I will leave here will also disappear us 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.430
 Desktop access the directory it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 Then I will show how they work 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 and minecraft before and at work 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.400
 of exposed but the program is worth 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.700
 fucking mother minecraft 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 so then this is the list 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.209
 is the first way to use it is worth the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.470
 second would be in relation to the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.510
 programs if you want to edit something and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.890
 render as fast as now 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.230
 I teach how to do it is worth with this same 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.160
 program then look how I'm doing 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.420
 side 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.100
 let's play this 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.300
 quite long enough you know 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.640
 when a little chunk and that's worth 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.380
 and well then now if we close this 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.870
 we are here to minecraft we select 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.300
 the game and we give post and execute vale 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.940
 then when you have loaded this will happen 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.530
 to the post mode it is worth it in which there will already be 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.820
 closed all processes are worth there 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.460
 Sometimes it is dark makes a screen 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.930
 another is clarified clarifies ce or as 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.230
 you want to say it is worth either about the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.400
 game automatically worth 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.010
 I'm going to give it a little more shine than the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.590
 wait screen 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.040
 If the bidder orders it, then 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.739
 here then as you can see, nothing is going 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.890
 well now if you see I'm not going at all 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.840
 praised compared to before it is valid for 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.370
 nothing elongated and it shows quite 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.989
 time to record with flaps and with others 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.239
 similar programs because it lowers you or 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.799
 you get a lot fps and with the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.230
 time to record because you're better off 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.760
 computer 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.530
 close it worth this would be the way to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.810
 use the program to subtract changing to 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.819
 normal mode is the way to use it in 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.680
 relationship to the games worth works in 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.150
 any game that you have ok 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.660
 all you have to do is 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.870
 execute let's run add or here 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.560
 that you get a little eyelash 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.560
 sapido 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.840
 you see here is about then here what 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.050
 only you have to give is to add and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.520
 look for it and now in the case of 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.259
 want to process a faster video 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.439
 you just have to go to give it to go to 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.930
 you activate and when you fill all the 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.479
 circuit of this already the computer have 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.969
 entered into a best performance before 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.060
 after the optimization uses better 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.099
 of a 40 by the way, and this is true 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.439
 you see these are all the processes that you 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.840
 I said then with this already 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.400
 you forget about people the problems of 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.199
 people program without videogames that to me 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.550
 to have a small computer this 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.430
 program has made my life easier 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.280
 then, at the time of 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.449
 to render a video sorry now 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.400
 same may take longer 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.689
 and for example now if I start 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.939
 render this video that is next 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.819
 that I'm going to upload can take me an hour 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.650
 and 40 minutes in rendering 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.259
 and maybe with the open program 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.999
 maybe it takes 45 minutes for me to 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.159
 You are worth here, you only have to 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.110
 do what to have restore 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.599
 you wait and that's it 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.919
 now you have the program then 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.389
 good successor link in the description and 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.999
 if you have any doubt you already know me 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.860
 you comment on a private and good message 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.650
 if that served, there are favorites to subscribe 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.879
 If you have already served I told you so 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.770
 good see you in the next video 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.819
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.819
 until another bye
