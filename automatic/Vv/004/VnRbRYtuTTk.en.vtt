00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
see our rg3 has two more speed he has

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
see our rg3 has two more speed he has
seven<00:00:50.789> more<00:00:50.940> awareness<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:52.170> more<00:00:52.440> throw

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
seven more awareness get more throw

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.270 
seven more awareness get more throw

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
power but throw accuracy short mid deep

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.270

and<00:00:56.610> almost<00:00:57.510> everything<00:00:57.960> else<00:00:58.109> Mariota<00:00:58.859> takes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and almost everything else Mariota takes

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
and almost everything else Mariota takes
the<00:00:59.550> cake<00:00:59.820> man<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> i'm<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.899> sure<00:01:01.199> Mariota

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the cake man and i'm pretty sure Mariota

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
the cake man and i'm pretty sure Mariota
is<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.940> probably<00:01:03.629> gonna<00:01:03.750> be

is going to be the is probably gonna be

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.520 
is going to be the is probably gonna be
the<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.589> more<00:01:05.540> ideal<00:01:06.540> quarterback<00:01:07.110> because

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the much more ideal quarterback because

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
the much more ideal quarterback because
he's<00:01:07.920> probably<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.490> much<00:01:08.670> simpler

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
he's probably going to be much simpler

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
he's probably going to be much simpler
to<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:09.869> mainly<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.070> first<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.210> look

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
