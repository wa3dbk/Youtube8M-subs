hi my friends let's talk about how do

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.350 
hi my friends let's talk about how do
you<00:00:11.660> create<00:00:11.930> a<00:00:12.020> little<00:00:12.560> fringe<00:00:13.040> that<00:00:13.580> really

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
you create a little fringe that really

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.450 
you create a little fringe that really
fits<00:00:14.690> with<00:00:14.870> a<00:00:14.930> pixie<00:00:15.380> in<00:00:15.560> other<00:00:15.920> words<00:00:16.100> let's

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
fits with a pixie in other words let's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.580 
fits with a pixie in other words let's
vandalize<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.180> fringe<00:00:17.630> that's<00:00:18.110> right

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
vandalize the fringe that's right

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.320 
vandalize the fringe that's right
vandalize<00:00:19.250> now<00:00:19.820> when<00:00:19.970> you<00:00:20.029> think<00:00:20.240> of

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
vandalize now when you think of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.490 
vandalize now when you think of
vandalize<00:00:20.690> your<00:00:20.900> thing<00:00:21.020> is<00:00:21.140> something<00:00:21.380> that's

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
vandalize your thing is something that's

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.670 
vandalize your thing is something that's
very<00:00:21.560> chewed<00:00:22.130> textured<00:00:22.850> really<00:00:23.390> broken<00:00:23.750> up<00:00:24.050> so

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
very chewed textured really broken up so

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.140 
very chewed textured really broken up so
now<00:00:24.800> let's<00:00:25.010> go<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.340> do<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:25.520> to<00:00:26.029> the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
now let's go in and do that to the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.339 
now let's go in and do that to the
fringe<00:00:26.419> so<00:00:26.660> we're<00:00:26.750> going<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:26.930> break<00:00:27.110> it<00:00:27.290> up

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
fringe so we're going to break it up

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.890 
fringe so we're going to break it up
working<00:00:27.770> with<00:00:27.950> our<00:00:28.369> six<00:00:28.730> gap<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.720> real

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
working with our six gap it's real

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.420 
working with our six gap it's real
simple<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.320> want<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.650> put<00:00:30.829> the<00:00:30.919> comb<00:00:31.130> down

don't use a comb you're going to work

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.870 
don't use a comb you're going to work
primarily<00:00:33.590> with<00:00:33.920> your<00:00:34.280> index<00:00:34.550> finger<00:00:34.850> and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
primarily with your index finger and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.819 
primarily with your index finger and
your<00:00:35.120> thumb<00:00:35.200> pinching<00:00:36.200> certain<00:00:36.560> areas

your thumb pinching certain areas

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.250 
your thumb pinching certain areas
together<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.180> more<00:00:38.360> clumpy<00:00:38.780> or<00:00:38.900> you<00:00:39.020> want

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
together so the more clumpy or you want

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.360 
together so the more clumpy or you want
it<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.470> more<00:00:39.620> hair<00:00:39.829> you're<00:00:39.950> going<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.130> pinch

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
it the more hair you're going to pinch

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.830 
it the more hair you're going to pinch
together<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.149> let's<00:00:41.270> take<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> look<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.719> see

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
together so let's take a look and see

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.150 
together so let's take a look and see
where<00:00:41.960> we're<00:00:42.079> at<00:00:42.109> this<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.770> where<00:00:42.890> we're<00:00:43.039> at

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
where we're at this is where we're at

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.060 
where we're at this is where we're at
now<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:45.260> want<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.530> take<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:45.920> start

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
now and I want to take and start

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.349 
now and I want to take and start
releasing<00:00:46.399> length<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.000> I'm<00:00:47.059> just<00:00:47.180> going<00:00:47.300> to

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
releasing length so I'm just going to

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.470 
releasing length so I'm just going to
come<00:00:47.570> over<00:00:47.600> here<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.079> side<00:00:48.320> area<00:00:49.480> okay

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
come over here to the side area okay

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.200 
come over here to the side area okay
pick<00:00:51.140> up<00:00:51.260> where<00:00:51.469> I<00:00:51.500> want<00:00:51.800> my<00:00:51.859> length<00:00:52.180> okay<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
pick up where I want my length okay and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
pick up where I want my length okay and
then<00:00:53.510> just<00:00:53.750> come<00:00:53.929> in<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:55.250> work<00:00:55.429> with<00:00:55.460> a

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
then just come in and just work with a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.419 
then just come in and just work with a
six<00:00:55.910> cat<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.710> find<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.859> when<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.039> work<00:00:58.250> with<00:00:58.280> a

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
six cat I find that when I work with a

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.430 
six cat I find that when I work with a
six<00:00:58.670> gap<00:00:58.940> notice<00:00:59.660> how<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.840> gave<00:01:00.019> me<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.230> little

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
six gap notice how it gave me a little

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.959 
six gap notice how it gave me a little
bit<00:01:00.559> more<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> chunkier<00:01:01.280> type<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.609> piece<00:01:01.789> to

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
bit more of a chunkier type of piece to

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.479 
bit more of a chunkier type of piece to
it<00:01:02.059> because<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.960> gap<00:01:03.230> within<00:01:03.710> each<00:01:04.129> play

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
it because of the gap within each play

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.400 
it because of the gap within each play
within<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.000> blades<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.660> gaps<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.260> have

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
within the blades the gaps that you have

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.840 
within the blades the gaps that you have
you're<00:01:07.100> able<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.310> create<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.580> little<00:01:07.670> bit<00:01:07.790> more

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
you're able to create a little bit more

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.780 
you're able to create a little bit more
chunkiness<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.660> okay<00:01:09.440> let's<00:01:09.920> go<00:01:10.100> back<00:01:10.280> grab

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
chunkiness to it okay let's go back grab

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.230 
chunkiness to it okay let's go back grab
a<00:01:10.820> section<00:01:11.300> again<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.290> alter<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.759> links

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
a section again and now alter the links

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.359 
a section again and now alter the links
start<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.720> just<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.079> adjust<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.619> length<00:01:15.829> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
start to just to adjust the length and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.730 
start to just to adjust the length and
start<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.060> just<00:01:17.270> going<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:17.840> visualize

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
start really just going in and visualize

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.210 
start really just going in and visualize
this

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
this

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.090 
this
so<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.000> reason<00:01:20.329> we<00:01:20.450> cut<00:01:20.689> dry<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:21.860> our

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
so the reason we cut dry is for our

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.770 
so the reason we cut dry is for our
purpose<00:01:22.729> not<00:01:22.939> for<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.240> purpose<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
purpose not for the purpose of the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.810 
purpose not for the purpose of the
client<00:01:24.170> when<00:01:24.649> cutting<00:01:24.920> dry<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.520> can<00:01:25.549> actually

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
client when cutting dry you can actually

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.510 
client when cutting dry you can actually
start<00:01:26.329> to<00:01:26.479> see<00:01:26.740> what's<00:01:27.740> happening<00:01:28.220> in<00:01:28.340> terms

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
start to see what's happening in terms

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.249 
start to see what's happening in terms
of<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.180> edges<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.750> what<00:01:29.869> you're<00:01:30.020> creating

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
of the edges of what you're creating

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.830 
of the edges of what you're creating
just<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.210> once<00:01:32.360> again<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.659> can<00:01:32.810> see

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
just going in and once again you can see

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.530 
just going in and once again you can see
how<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.290> section<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:34.130> fits<00:01:34.490> into<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.119> I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
how that section just fits into it and I

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.539 
how that section just fits into it and I
get<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.869> little<00:01:36.049> bit<00:01:36.229> more<00:01:36.380> chunky<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.399> what

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
get it a little bit more chunky so what

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.609 
get it a little bit more chunky so what
I'm<00:01:37.640> trying<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:37.969> do<00:01:38.149> is<00:01:38.299> not<00:01:38.509> make<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:38.899> so<00:01:39.079> PC

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
I'm trying to do is not make it so PC

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.350 
I'm trying to do is not make it so PC
but<00:01:40.159> make<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.369> more<00:01:40.640> look<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:41.210> almost

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
but make it more look like it's almost

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.780 
but make it more look like it's almost
chewed<00:01:41.990> almost<00:01:42.890> like<00:01:43.040> it's<00:01:43.189> got<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> little<00:01:43.670> bit

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
chewed almost like it's got a little bit

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.490 
chewed almost like it's got a little bit
of<00:01:43.880> chunkiness<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:44.780> steppy<00:01:45.380> if

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
of chunkiness to it it's steppy if

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.310 
of chunkiness to it it's steppy if
anything<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.219> okay<00:01:46.969> working<00:01:47.570> through<00:01:47.719> now

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
anything to it okay working through now

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.530 
anything to it okay working through now
I<00:01:48.350> like<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.740> just<00:01:49.040> kind<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.250> pull<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.939> top<00:01:50.210> away

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
I like to just kind of pull the top away

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.200 
I like to just kind of pull the top away
and<00:01:51.020> start<00:01:51.320> working<00:01:51.530> underneath<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.789> tend<00:01:53.090> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
and start working underneath you tend to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.550 
and start working underneath you tend to
if<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.390> do<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:54.020> happens<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.409> might

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
if you do that what happens you might

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080 
if you do that what happens you might
have<00:01:54.680> late<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.100> falls<00:01:55.399> over<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.939> might

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
have late that falls over it you might

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.910 
have late that falls over it you might
like<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.509> link<00:01:56.719> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.380> what<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.530> mean<00:01:57.770> by

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
like the link this is what I mean by

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.800 
like the link this is what I mean by
visualizing<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.000> just<00:01:59.119> see<00:01:59.329> it<00:01:59.450> as<00:01:59.600> you

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
visualizing this and just see it as you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.350 
visualizing this and just see it as you
go<00:01:59.960> once<00:02:00.530> again<00:02:00.649> just<00:02:01.039> coming<00:02:01.250> across<00:02:01.360> notice

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
go once again just coming across notice

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.149 
go once again just coming across notice
I<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.450> kind<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:02.840> set<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.289> section<00:02:03.979> right

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
I just kind of set that section right

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.940 
I just kind of set that section right
into<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.149> gap<00:02:05.359> of<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.719> blade<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.289> now<00:02:06.829> I'm

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
into the gap of the blade and now I'm

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.469 
into the gap of the blade and now I'm
almost<00:02:07.219> going<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.520> use<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.939> like<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> straight

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
almost going to use it like a straight

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.430 
almost going to use it like a straight
edge<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.020> just<00:02:09.619> let<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.120> come<00:02:11.120> off<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:12.170> that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
edge and just let it come off with that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.560 
edge and just let it come off with that
gap<00:02:12.740> of<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.250> blade<00:02:13.460> doing<00:02:13.850> all<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.210> work<00:02:14.360> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
gap of the blade doing all the work to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.830 
gap of the blade doing all the work to
it<00:02:16.150> okay<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.480> going<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.629> encourage

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
it okay and then I'm going to encourage

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
it okay and then I'm going to encourage
you<00:02:17.959> when<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.260> do<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:19.190> take<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> step

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
you when you do this really take a step

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
back excuse me I'm going to take a step

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.780 
back excuse me I'm going to take a step

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
just start to look at the big picture

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.110 
just start to look at the big picture
when<00:02:24.650> we're<00:02:24.799> too<00:02:24.950> close<00:02:25.159> we're<00:02:25.519> continually

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
when we're too close we're continually

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.179 
when we're too close we're continually
looking<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.959> smallest<00:02:27.349> picture<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
looking at the smallest picture and you

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.890 
looking at the smallest picture and you
can<00:02:28.310> really<00:02:28.430> start<00:02:28.609> to<00:02:28.879> see<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.390> little

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
can really start to see just little

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.869 
can really start to see just little
pieces<00:02:30.109> that<00:02:30.469> you<00:02:30.620> might<00:02:30.799> have<00:02:30.920> missed<00:02:31.549> come

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
pieces that you might have missed come

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:48.030 
pieces that you might have missed come
back<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.359> just<00:02:32.780> start<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.109> take<00:02:33.290> them<00:02:33.469> away

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.449 

all<00:02:48.849> right<00:02:49.060> let's<00:02:49.209> move<00:02:49.360> over<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
all right let's move over to the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.809 
all right let's move over to the
opposite<00:02:51.459> side<00:02:51.659> once<00:02:52.659> again<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:53.230> grabbing

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
opposite side once again just grabbing

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.289 
opposite side once again just grabbing
chunks<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.939> hair<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.829> coming<00:02:56.829> through<00:02:57.299> place

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
chunks of hair and coming through place

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.020 
chunks of hair and coming through place
it<00:02:58.480> into<00:02:58.750> our<00:02:58.900> sixth<00:02:59.200> gap<00:02:59.400> now<00:03:00.400> could<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.760> use

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
it into our sixth gap now could I use

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.330 
it into our sixth gap now could I use
Sam<00:03:01.360> if<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.659> wanted<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.230> straightedge<00:03:02.739> with

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
Sam if I wanted to the straightedge with

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.430 
Sam if I wanted to the straightedge with
my<00:03:03.579> guard<00:03:03.849> yes<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.540> could<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.200> you're<00:03:05.290> going

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
my guard yes you could but you're going

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080 
my guard yes you could but you're going
to<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> little<00:03:05.920> bit<00:03:06.129> more<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.519> softer

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
to get a little bit more of a softer

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.660 
to get a little bit more of a softer
edge<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.799> taking<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.400> little

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
edge to it this is taking it a little

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.160 
edge to it this is taking it a little
bit<00:03:09.849> more<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.329> chunkier<00:03:11.140> basis<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
bit more on a chunkier basis to it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.330 
bit more on a chunkier basis to it
remember<00:03:14.170> where<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.440> place<00:03:14.680> your<00:03:14.709> razor<00:03:15.129> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
remember where you place your razor and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.190 
remember where you place your razor and
where<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.579> go<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.909> that's<00:03:16.359> where<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.870> length

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
where you go in that's where that length

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.390 
where you go in that's where that length
is<00:03:17.409> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.739> start<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.069> pop<00:03:18.340> off<00:03:20.280> start<00:03:21.280> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
is going to start to pop off start to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.430 
is going to start to pop off start to
think<00:03:21.579> in<00:03:21.670> variations<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.329> length<00:03:22.569> okay<00:03:23.290> so

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
think in variations of length okay so

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.569 
think in variations of length okay so
I'm<00:03:23.590> going<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.769> come<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:24.010> higher<00:03:25.920> okay<00:03:26.950> I'm

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
I'm going to come up higher okay I'm

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.000 
I'm going to come up higher okay I'm
going<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.819> come<00:03:27.970> up<00:03:28.000> higher<00:03:28.269> here<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.859> I'm<00:03:29.950> just

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
going to come up higher here so I'm just

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.520 
going to come up higher here so I'm just
going<00:03:30.370> back<00:03:30.519> through<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.379> changing<00:03:32.379> the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
going back through and just changing the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.890 
going back through and just changing the
visual<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.250> see<00:03:33.609> okay

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
visual of what I see okay

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.660 
visual of what I see okay
look<00:03:35.139> at<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.440> depths<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.220> see<00:03:36.459> there

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
look at that depths that you see there

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.000 
look at that depths that you see there
in<00:03:36.700> terms<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.180> look<00:03:37.690> how<00:03:37.840> thick<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.680> how

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
in terms of that look how thick and how

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.699 
in terms of that look how thick and how
chunky<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.329> let's<00:03:40.840> grab<00:03:41.109> a<00:03:41.139> section<00:03:41.500> in

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
chunky that is let's grab a section in

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.920 
chunky that is let's grab a section in
the<00:03:41.799> center<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.159> that<00:03:42.400> just<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.269> break<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.690> up

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the center of that just to break this up

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.520 
the center of that just to break this up
and<00:03:44.139> let's<00:03:44.769> just<00:03:44.950> take<00:03:45.159> that<00:03:49.049> okay<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.109> really

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
and let's just take that okay so really

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.180 
and let's just take that okay so really
really<00:03:50.950> visualize<00:03:51.609> this<00:03:52.319> all<00:03:53.319> right<00:03:53.530> now

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
really visualize this all right now

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.569 
really visualize this all right now
let's<00:03:54.400> bring<00:03:54.609> down<00:03:54.669> our<00:03:55.590> excess<00:03:56.590> length<00:03:56.889> and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
let's bring down our excess length and

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.220 
let's bring down our excess length and
start<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:58.000> see<00:03:58.180> where<00:03:58.359> we<00:03:58.540> want<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> take<00:03:58.870> that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
start to see where we want to take that

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.530 
start to see where we want to take that
all<00:04:02.230> right<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:02.709> turn<00:04:03.040> here<00:04:03.609> start<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.359> grab

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
all right so turn here start to grab

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.780 
all right so turn here start to grab
let's<00:04:04.750> take<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.049> length<00:04:05.199> off<00:04:05.440> first<00:04:05.769> then<00:04:06.699> I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
let's take the length off first then I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.119 
let's take the length off first then I
can<00:04:06.970> come<00:04:07.150> back<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:08.379> can<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.739> start<00:04:08.859> to

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
can come back and I can just start to

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.830 
can come back and I can just start to
just<00:04:09.340> really<00:04:09.639> separate<00:04:10.329> what<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.510> want<00:04:10.750> to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
just really separate what I want to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.580 
just really separate what I want to
separate

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.400 

all<00:04:16.280> right<00:04:16.459> it's<00:04:16.820> almost<00:04:16.970> like<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:18.139> want<00:04:18.320> to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
all right it's almost like you want to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.020 
all right it's almost like you want to
make<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.650> look<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.980> she<00:04:19.220> cut<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.489> herself<00:04:19.910> but

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
make it look like she cut it herself but

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.220 
make it look like she cut it herself but
I<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.450> be<00:04:20.540> honest<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.810> tell<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.049> one<00:04:21.169> of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
I have to be honest to tell you one of

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.200 
I have to be honest to tell you one of
most<00:04:21.350> difficult<00:04:21.799> things<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.100> do<00:04:22.730> is<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.060> make

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
most difficult things to do is to make

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.240 
most difficult things to do is to make
something<00:04:23.480> look<00:04:23.750> more<00:04:23.990> casual<00:04:24.770> make

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
something look more casual make

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.860 
something look more casual make
something<00:04:25.580> look<00:04:25.669> more<00:04:25.910> organic<00:04:26.389> or<00:04:26.540> like<00:04:26.720> it's

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
something look more organic or like it's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.590 
something look more organic or like it's
done<00:04:27.080> by<00:04:27.380> them<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.460> it's<00:04:28.730> much<00:04:28.970> easier<00:04:29.000> for<00:04:29.540> us

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
done by them so it's much easier for us

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.120 
done by them so it's much easier for us
because<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.350> way<00:04:30.440> we're<00:04:30.680> training<00:04:30.980> to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
because of the way we're training to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.470 
because of the way we're training to
create<00:04:31.370> something<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.880> little<00:04:32.240> bit<00:04:32.330> more

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
create something a little bit more

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.090 
create something a little bit more
balanced<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.990> precision<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:33.860> when<00:04:34.010> you

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
balanced to precision but when you

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.320 
balanced to precision but when you
create<00:04:34.310> need<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.580> create<00:04:34.790> something<00:04:35.060> that's<00:04:35.150> a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
create need to create something that's a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.570 
create need to create something that's a
little<00:04:35.570> bit<00:04:35.690> more<00:04:35.930> kind<00:04:36.139> of<00:04:36.280> undone<00:04:37.280> if<00:04:37.460> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
little bit more kind of undone if you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.659 
little bit more kind of undone if you
will<00:04:37.790> or<00:04:38.050> vandalized<00:04:39.070> then<00:04:40.070> it's<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.460> little

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
will or vandalized then it's a little

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.070 
will or vandalized then it's a little
bit<00:04:40.790> more<00:04:40.970> difficult<00:04:41.480> because<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.840> really

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
bit more difficult because it really

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.900 
bit more difficult because it really
requires<00:04:42.470> your<00:04:42.710> eye<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.460> requires<00:04:43.790> a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
requires your eye and it requires a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.720 
requires your eye and it requires a
touch<00:04:44.950> now<00:04:45.950> there's<00:04:46.130> certain<00:04:46.250> areas<00:04:46.490> where

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
touch now there's certain areas where

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.159 
touch now there's certain areas where
you<00:04:46.820> might<00:04:46.940> see<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:47.570> want<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.930> maintain

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
you might see that you want to maintain

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.870 
you might see that you want to maintain
length<00:04:50.830> okay<00:04:51.830> let's<00:04:52.130> go<00:04:52.250> after<00:04:52.370> this<00:04:52.639> piece

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
length okay let's go after this piece

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.190 
length okay let's go after this piece
here<00:04:54.850> just<00:04:55.850> going<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.060> leave<00:04:56.240> that<00:04:56.270> long<00:04:56.690> first

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
here just going to leave that long first

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.409 
here just going to leave that long first
I<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.919> always<00:04:58.190> come<00:04:58.460> back<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.060> take<00:04:59.210> that

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
I can always come back in and take that

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.170 
I can always come back in and take that
shorter<00:04:59.930> if<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.200> want<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.620> any<00:05:01.250> excess<00:05:01.729> pieces

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
shorter if I want to any excess pieces

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.890 
shorter if I want to any excess pieces
just<00:05:02.389> grabbing<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.560> taking<00:05:03.979> them<00:05:04.130> off<00:05:07.900> now

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
just grabbing and taking them off now

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.680 
just grabbing and taking them off now
just<00:05:09.200> really<00:05:09.560> starting<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.919> work<00:05:10.100> this

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
just really starting to work this

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.219 
just really starting to work this
imagine<00:05:11.690> if<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:12.370> put<00:05:13.370> my<00:05:13.660> shape<00:05:14.660> factor<00:05:15.080> in

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
imagine if I put my shape factor in

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.290 
imagine if I put my shape factor in
there<00:05:15.380> 22<00:05:15.950> look<00:05:16.400> at<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.610> texture<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.150> you're

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
there 22 look at the texture that you're

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.100 
there 22 look at the texture that you're
getting<00:05:17.600> out<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:19.270> now<00:05:20.270> depending<00:05:21.020> upon

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
getting out of that now depending upon

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.840 
getting out of that now depending upon
the<00:05:21.350> personality<00:05:21.800> I<00:05:22.070> really<00:05:22.460> believe<00:05:22.820> that

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
the personality I really believe that

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.700 
the personality I really believe that
that<00:05:23.120> determines<00:05:23.780> how<00:05:23.900> short<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.410> can<00:05:24.560> take

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
that determines how short you can take

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.040 
that determines how short you can take
something<00:05:25.070> in<00:05:25.250> regards<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.880> fringe<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.510> fringe

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
something in regards to fringe a fringe

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.020 
something in regards to fringe a fringe
could<00:05:27.260> be<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.350> really<00:05:27.560> fragile<00:05:28.039> area<00:05:28.550> but<00:05:29.000> I

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
could be a really fragile area but I

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.210 
could be a really fragile area but I
also<00:05:29.180> believe<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.600> fringe<00:05:30.110> awakens<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.979> shape

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
also believe that fringe awakens a shape

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.190 
also believe that fringe awakens a shape
so<00:05:31.880> anytime<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.270> want<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.419> awaken<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.960> shape

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
so anytime you want to awaken the shape

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.650 
so anytime you want to awaken the shape
just<00:05:33.919> go<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:34.250> attack<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.700> fridge<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.450> you'll

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
just go and attack the fridge and you'll

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.510 
just go and attack the fridge and you'll
really<00:05:35.870> change<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.380> cut<00:05:36.560> up<00:05:36.680> but<00:05:37.070> court<00:05:37.340> was

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
really change the cut up but court was

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.510 
really change the cut up but court was
how<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.180> had<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.330> sense<00:05:38.600> of<00:05:38.810> tilting<00:05:39.590> going<00:05:40.370> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
how it had a sense of tilting going to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.120 
how it had a sense of tilting going to
it<00:05:40.669> moving<00:05:41.150> over<00:05:41.510> length<00:05:42.020> but<00:05:42.770> now<00:05:42.890> look<00:05:43.039> how

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
it moving over length but now look how

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.219 
it moving over length but now look how
we've<00:05:43.280> taken<00:05:43.430> that<00:05:43.640> length<00:05:43.850> off<00:05:44.090> but<00:05:44.750> yet<00:05:44.960> it's

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
we've taken that length off but yet it's

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.950 
we've taken that length off but yet it's
almost<00:05:45.860> really<00:05:46.190> got<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:46.880> kind<00:05:47.150> of<00:05:47.210> chewy

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
almost really got this kind of chewy

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.080 
almost really got this kind of chewy
texture<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.979> really<00:05:49.550> believe<00:05:49.789> that's

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
texture to it I really believe that's
