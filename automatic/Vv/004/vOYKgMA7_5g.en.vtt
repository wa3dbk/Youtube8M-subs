00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
 the biblical point of view are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.139
 compatible science and the bible 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.059
 the most significant moments and 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.790
 rewarding of my investigations 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.920
 scientific are those occasions in 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.240
 those that I discover something and I tell myself 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 same and that's how God did henri 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 safer chemistry teacher 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.760
 science contributes greatly to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 our understanding of the natural world 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.890
 It reveals a degree of order 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 precision and complexity that in opinion 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 of many people points to the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 existence of a god of intelligence and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 infinite power for them science does not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.170
 it only provides details about the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 nature but also allows them 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.600
 know how is God 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.470
 the bible gives broad support to that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.020
 point of view for example Romans 120 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.150
 ensures the invisible qualities of 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 god are clearly seen from the creation 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.309
 from the world onwards because they are perceived 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.220
 for the things done up to his power 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.390
 everlasting and divinity 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 likewise psalm 19 1 and 2 affirms the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.800
 heavens are declaring the glory of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 God and the work of his hands the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.110
 expansion is reporting one day after 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 another day the speech bubbles out 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 and one night after another night manifests 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.479
 knowledge with all the wonders of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.120
 the creation only reveal to us some 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.220
 characteristics of our creator 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.740
 the limits of science 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.440
 many truths about God are more 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.870
 beyond the scope of science 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.820
 let's illustrate what the scientist could 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.880
 describe each of the molecules of 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 a chocolate cake but it would reveal its 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.400
 analysis why or for whom it was 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.800
 crafted the cake as is obvious for 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.690
 know the answer to these questions that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 are the most important for many 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.400
 people should be asked 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.700
 directly to whoever prepared the cake 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.460
 the same thing happens with science 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.410
 provides a lot of factual information 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.140
 wrote the Austrian physicist and prize 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.870
 nobel ervin budinger but it's 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.550
 horribly mute about all and 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 each of the things that are 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.970
 really close to our heart that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.070
 we are really interested for him between 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.060
 such things are concepts like 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.700
 god and eternity in effect only god 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.760
 You can answer questions such as 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 what is the universe because it houses 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.990
 our planet an extraordinary 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.400
 variety of life forms including 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.620
 intelligent life if god is really 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.320
 almighty because it allows evil and 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.300
 suffering and there is some hope 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.890
 for those who have died 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.040
 has God answered these questions yes and 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.560
 he has done it in the pages of the bible 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.540
 you may think about it but how can I 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.720
 be sure that the bible comes 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.060
 of god well from a point of 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 scientific view what the bible says 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.830
 as for the world around us should 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.370
 agree with the facts already proven 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.230
 that God can not contradict 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.660
 then harmonize the bible with the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.660
 science let's see some examples 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.970
 was ahead of the knowledge of his 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.710
 time 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.930
 during the time it was 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.930
 many people writing the bible 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.670
 they believed that things like the sun the moon the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.340
 weather and fertility 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.980
 they were controlled not by laws 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.470
 natural but by gods that inhabited 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.960
 in this world but the Hebrew prophets 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.840
 of antiquity did not share that point 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.670
 of sight they knew that jehovah god 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.070
 could control the forces of 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.980
 nature and that's what he had done in 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.770
 certain occasions rightly 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.560
 jon lennox math teacher of the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.870
 oxford university england pointed 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.820
 that those prophets were not 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.310
 necessary des divinizar de dioses 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.350
 mythical in the universe by the simple 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.680
 reason that they had never believed in 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.500
 gods of those superstitions had them 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.290
 delivered his faith in a true god 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.510
 creator of heaven and earth 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.460
 like the books your faith in god of the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.470
 superstition 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.300
 to begin the true god they 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.970
 revealed that he ruled the universe 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.890
 using concrete statutes or 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:42.440
 laws for example more than 3,500 years ago 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.570
 Jehovah asked his servant Job has 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.850
 come to know the statutes of the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.770
 skies job 38 33 in the 7th century 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.470
 before our era the prophet Jeremiah 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.170
 he also wrote about the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.590
 statutes of heaven and earth 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.200
 Jeremiah 33 25 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.090
 therefore all that in that time 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.880
 they had faith in the writings of the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.850
 biblical prophets knew that the universe 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.580
 is governed by rational laws not by 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.830
 capricious mythical gods hence that 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.320
 those faithful servants of god do not 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.440
 they will adore things that he had created as 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.330
 the sun the moon or the stars ni 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.900
 they will harbor superstitions as to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.360
 such creations rather considered 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.150
 that divine works are worthy objects 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.940
 of study that reflect wisdom the 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.010
 power and other qualities of God 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.990
 like many scientists of 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.880
 our time the Hebrews of the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.630
 ancient people believed that the universe had 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.880
 beginning then genesis 11 says in the 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.690
 principle god created the heavens and the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.630
 earth also god revealed to him that 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:59.550
 the earth is hanging over nothing is 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:04.200
 say suspended in the space job 26 7 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:06.120
 finally more than 2500 years ago the 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.780
 prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.190
 Is shaped like a circle or sphere 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.160
 40 22 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.990
 the footnote says for a 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.360
 more detailed explanation of the 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.750
 existence of god and the accuracy of the 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.750
 bible see the booklet is life work 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.790
 of a creator as well as the book exists 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.340
 a creator who is interested in us 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.420
 Both publications edited by the 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:37.420
 witnesses of jehova end of the note 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.400
 as we have seen the bible if it agrees 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.140
 with scientific truths regarding 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.690
 nature 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.690
 in fact science and the bible not only 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.230
 they are compatible but they complement each other 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.720
 perfectly discard any of 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.770
 the two is to leave a door closed 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.400
 leads to the knowledge of god has it 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.710
 asked 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.090
 that teaches us the creation about 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.580
 Roman god 1 20 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.340
 what truth is as to God they are more 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.940
 beyond the scope of second science to 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.860
 Timoteo 316 because they did not force 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.930
 superstitions in terms of creation 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:24.120
 the prophets of the true god 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:24.120
 Jeremiah 3325 end of article
