00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.270
 It is raining from this day 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.270
 draft 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 End 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.820
 It is Noshiro 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.980
 This is 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.619
 That 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.739
 Thinness 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.789
 Once but 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.249
 Very cheap 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.569
 Both 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.179
 That's about 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.849
 That's what it looks like 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.849
 I have not seen anything in 5 years at a glance 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.150
 Mike from both sides of the US economy 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.560
 Still 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.820
 Different 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.650
 Yeah stand 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 Goto Islands too 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.750
 Also to take an interesting picture of the March same year 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.520
 Already 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 North 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 It's very exciting when you play like this 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 2 minutes 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.630
 Really 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.830
 Surprisingly 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.290
 It's fun 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 This is what I put in when I think that I entered first 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.230
 Also 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.590
 one more 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 How to enjoy 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.950
 I wonder 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.780
 think 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.969
 Then it is the same camera, but here 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 not really 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.610
 even taking hyper-v photos 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.340
 There is what I can not help but I have high insulation 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 I can't expect that much 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.990
 It has been a lot since I thought to get the mound to time out 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.060
 Well, I can not get on with the aircraft 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.100
 Edogawa 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.810
 A little 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 I can't paint yet, but I'm free to some extent 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.299
 With regard to 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.760
 I think it's okay to think that it is a body in the house 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.100
 I think I should go out 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 The shin godzilla plan is also one by one until next 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.609
 Yes 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.179
 14th in ipodtouch 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.369
 Not general 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:15.709
 This is what 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.939
 If you can choose the first one in the third one 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.789
 Mr. Yamamoto 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.709
 Form is registered 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.989
 The phone number of the person who already has a cell phone or 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.949
 If you call to the e-mail address 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.089
 That's all 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.619
 Very easy 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 Yeah the place is attractive 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.169
 Open in front of you 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 I was disappointed timely 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.679
 It is shaped like a grandchild, and whether it is a video taken with ana iy bat 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.059
 Of course 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.159
 My bag and Maimon high but I do not read 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.159
 If you can practice here, you will be in mode 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.879
 Pick on the maiden 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 Why 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.309
 Now cut out 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.449
 9 people 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.759
 We will add 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.939
 It is a problem that 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.809
 Seniors who have been separately for three generations from the beginning 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:24.709
 eh 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 I am in the hall very much 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.529
 Ceramic clay of the timeline 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:32.499
 Dismantling 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.329
 It is intuitive Nojima who can fish 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 It is not this much, but like this 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:45.249
 More than the size of the Corridor is prepared for each theme 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.989
 End 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:47.680
 Before
