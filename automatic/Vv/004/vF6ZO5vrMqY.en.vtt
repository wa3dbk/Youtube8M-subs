00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.480
 without place some women today 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.059
 we want to show off an impeccable makeup 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.910
 a skin also quite silky and 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.910
 We forget that cleaning after 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 makeup is very important then the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.449
 today I'm going to show you my routine 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.369
 for you to make up and take care of my skin 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.249
 I always start removing my eyelashes 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.480
 False simply shot a little bit of 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.270
 them and ready 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.740
 then separated them to wash them if they 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.300
 Interested in knowing how I can be left 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.280
 in the comments if I make a video 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.840
 extra how do i take care of my eyelashes 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.149
 false 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.609
 then he used these wipes 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.129
 make-up removers of corpse to sell them 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.489
 cell for which I came in Germany and with 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.160
 a single wipe in my case is more than 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.789
 enough this is the wrinkle that for 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.649
 more than 35 years well for hair well what 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.079
 said then with a wipe for me 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:05.150
 enough always tried to remove makeup 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.070
 using ascending movements and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.340
 circulars that will benefit the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.810
 microsphere circulation and also to the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.390
 wrinkle prevention 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.909
 as the eyes see the floor of makeup 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.970
 in circular movements inwards 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.189
 to prevent what are the legs of 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.130
 and careerists as chickens around 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.580
 what about the eyelashes also 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.399
 forward so as not to mistreat the and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.670
 more or less basically that's how 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.720
 I usually use the wipes 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.399
 I practically took almost all 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 makeup with them what we can 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.829
 use two products or one in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.830
 cream this this case and one in the 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.179
 liquid is to make up our floor 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.190
 also use them but today 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.020
 I'm going to show another trend that is with 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.270
 oils these are normal oils that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.220
 also used for hair here there 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.220
 almond oil avocado and so on 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.380
 good as a little as you see from the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.420
 oil what is said can be any 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.610
 even olive oil is also going to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.530
 work and with a little bit on your finger 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.140
 annular which is the least force has 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.209
 massage or my eyelashes that is where 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 there is still a little bit of the rest of 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.110
 makeup remember we have to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 completely remove us that are not left 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.480
 nothing at all 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.159
 then with circular movements 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 massage or my eyelashes plus jet is 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.989
 make up, this will strengthen 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.629
 hydrate the crystals I do the same with 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.209
 my lips and I proceed with a washcloth 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.640
 make-up remover again to remove the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.980
 remaining oil and product that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.200
 could be both on the top 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.200
 of my eyelashes as in the lower ones 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.520
 we continue then to wash the face 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.800
 I usually do it with a soap in foam and 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.610
 this time you will also see this day 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.070
 and is for people over 35 years 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.960
 they also prevent wrinkles and quite 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.240
 soft with the skin I have a very skin 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.580
 fatty is a pretty soft league 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.040
 pretty clean without leaving the suspender 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.920
 I love years I have used it 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.960
 to continue using it always well 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.260
 then then I have shown another 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.420
 time as they see circular massages for 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.390
 clean the face floor then wash it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.920
 with normal water neither cold nor hot and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.530
 then with a special wipe that only 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.750
 use for my face I give little taps as 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.250
 come do not squeeze the face is not good 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.100
 squeeze the face but touch 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 to dry from biden also always the 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.730
 same as they do in the face 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.070
 also well the following I do not know for me 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.160
 Care is 60 always apply first 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.710
 the 0 this this caudal and as a small 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 amount is more than enough I apply it 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.300
 on the forehead 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.180
 at the corners of the lips 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.020
 and a little on the cheeks 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.800
 then used the moisturizer is 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.090
 is validated has decay and I love 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.860
 it's a cream for the day but I 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.290
 I use day and night for the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.510
 The result that gives me is excellent, it leaves me 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.070
 the skin is quite soft but it does not 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.530
 leaves fatty at all you will see in 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.040
 the continuation that while massage or 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.530
 cream to penetrate the face 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.840
 The skin is completely clean 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.630
 remains greasy is not postponed in the middle 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.060
 of that and in addition because it gives you a 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.950
 incredible moisture to my skin like 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.340
 way in the neck do not forget my 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.340
 loves 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.230
 today I'm going to the eye area in this 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.480
 occasion you can also use 1 of each 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.890
 day you will see this is a brand that is 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.140
 I'm doing it economically 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.630
 also like that so they can see that all 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.310
 Economical products can also be 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.170
 included in our daily routine and not 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.420
 they have to be high products 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.910
 range not too expensive for anything though 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.520
 let us have a daily care of our 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.710
 skin is enough no matter the cost 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.750
 of the product used well for the contour 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.450
 of eyes I always use it in a way 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.310
 circulate and do not forget the part of 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.430
 animal that is sometimes forgetting and already 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.500
 to conclude hydrate my lips this is 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.960
 also in the flow hydrating bar 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.730

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.580

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.700
 a laid band that I went through the 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.620
 late with her and what I do is that the 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.410
 I lay down and pick up my hair in a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.800

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.910
 single return to the rubber as they see so that 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.550

 bright clean but does not look greasy 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.370
 for nothing that's why I like these 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.620
