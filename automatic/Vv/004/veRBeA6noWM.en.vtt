well I trained for almost a month on
that<00:02:14.250> sort<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> knife<00:02:15.780> fighting<00:02:16.110> which<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that sort of knife fighting which is a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.979 
that sort of knife fighting which is a
Filipino<00:02:16.950> style<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.760> knife<00:02:17.940> fighting<00:02:18.209> which

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
Filipino style of knife fighting which

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.690 
Filipino style of knife fighting which
is<00:02:19.140> really<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> way<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.770> kill<00:02:20.040> people<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
is really just a way to kill people and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640 
is really just a way to kill people and
then<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.810> once<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.410> learn<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
then some once you kind of learn the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.979 
then some once you kind of learn the
moves<00:02:23.069> then<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.180> had<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> choreograph<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
moves then we had to choreograph the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.570 
moves then we had to choreograph the
fight<00:02:25.019> which<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:25.680> very<00:02:26.400> complicated<00:02:26.910> because

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
fight which was very complicated because

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
fight which was very complicated because
because<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.760> shot<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.209> staircases<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
because it was shot on staircases and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.160 
because it was shot on staircases and
that<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.239> not<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.720> doesn't<00:02:33.870> make<00:02:34.019> for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that that was not that doesn't make for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.100 
that that was not that doesn't make for
an<00:02:34.260> easy<00:02:35.030> choreography<00:02:36.140> bit<00:02:37.140> yeah<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
an easy choreography bit yeah what and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.229 
an easy choreography bit yeah what and
so<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> my<00:02:40.709> whole<00:02:40.980> goal<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.790> make<00:02:42.030> it

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
so I my whole goal was just to make it

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.120 
so I my whole goal was just to make it
look<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.720> could<00:02:42.810> actually<00:02:43.080> do<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
look like I could actually do this and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.000 
look like I could actually do this and
that<00:02:44.160> looked<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.430> an<00:02:44.610> idiot<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:46.010> I'm

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that looked like an idiot and I'm

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.039 
that looked like an idiot and I'm
fighting<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.730> Sean<00:02:47.970> Harris<00:02:48.299> made<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> look<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
fighting with Sean Harris made it look a

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.789 
fighting with Sean Harris made it look a
lot<00:02:49.410> more<00:02:49.590> real<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.299> bashed<00:02:51.989> my<00:02:52.230> arm<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
