00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
as some others years have been and we

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.610 
as some others years have been and we

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
be coming straight at us but for where

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.690 
be coming straight at us but for where
we<00:00:35.629> are<00:00:35.660> at<00:00:35.989> least<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.500> kind<00:00:36.739> of<00:00:36.829> disappeared

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
we are at least it kind of disappeared

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.250 
we are at least it kind of disappeared
into<00:00:37.879> nothing<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:38.870> had<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.020> free<00:00:39.230> day

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
into nothing so we just had a free day

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.970 
into nothing so we just had a free day
with<00:00:39.590> nothing<00:00:39.740> to<00:00:40.130> do<00:00:40.310> but<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.710> raining

with nothing to do but it is raining
today<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.640> I<00:00:43.910> just<00:00:43.940> think<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.870> kind<00:00:45.170> of

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
today and I just think of this kind of

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.500 
today and I just think of this kind of
pattern<00:00:46.220> maybe<00:00:46.400> as<00:00:46.610> some<00:00:46.790> fun<00:00:47.000> things<00:00:47.030> to

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
pattern maybe as some fun things to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.870 
pattern maybe as some fun things to
share<00:00:47.720> for<00:00:48.200> this<00:00:48.500> time<00:00:48.770> of<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.980> season<00:00:49.070> before

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
share for this time of the season before

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.090 
share for this time of the season before
we<00:00:50.150> get<00:00:50.510> into<00:00:50.810> fall<00:00:51.050> on<00:00:51.170> hot<00:00:51.560> days<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:52.040> summer

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
different variations of patterns I've

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.889 
different variations of patterns I've
used<00:00:59.660> you<00:01:00.350> can<00:01:00.500> see<00:01:00.680> here<00:01:01.040> these<00:01:01.340> two<00:01:01.899> there's

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
ahead and made this little trapezoid box

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.490 
ahead and made this little trapezoid box
because<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.390> thought<00:01:41.659> it'd<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.930> nice<00:01:42.140> way<00:01:42.200> to

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
because I thought it'd be a nice way to

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.280 
because I thought it'd be a nice way to
kind<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.890> use<00:01:43.189> both<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.360> two<00:01:45.049> different

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
kind of use both the two different

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.170 
kind of use both the two different
patterns<00:01:45.680> together<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.729> does<00:01:46.880> when<00:01:47.060> I'm

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
patterns together and it does when I'm

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.560 
patterns together and it does when I'm
making<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.510> really<00:01:47.540> nice<00:01:48.049> sturdy<00:01:48.500> box<00:01:48.860> too<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.670> I
