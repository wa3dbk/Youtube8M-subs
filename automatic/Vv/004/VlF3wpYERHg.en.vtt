00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710 

right<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.020> main<00:00:01.260> bar<00:00:01.469> taking<00:00:01.920> out

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
right this is the main bar taking out

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.140 
right this is the main bar taking out
what<00:00:03.720> we've<00:00:03.840> got<00:00:04.080> here<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.430> connector

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
what we've got here is the connector

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.200 
what we've got here is the connector
this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> connector<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.049> goes<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
this is the connector that goes to the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.749 
this is the connector that goes to the
LCD<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.599> at<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> end<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.679> missing<00:00:11.580> so

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
LCD now at the end of it missing so

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.879 
LCD now at the end of it missing so
there's<00:00:11.910> damage<00:00:12.120> there<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.559> very

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
there's damage there and that very

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.630 
there's damage there and that very
contact<00:00:14.460> there<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> top<00:00:15.150> right<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:16.640> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
contact there and the top right of the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.359 
contact there and the top right of the
connector<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.690> doesn't<00:00:19.410> really<00:00:19.680> look<00:00:20.039> right

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
connector it doesn't really look right

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.509 
connector it doesn't really look right
so<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.810> could<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.130> damaged<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so that could be damaged up in the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
so that could be damaged up in the
backline<00:00:23.699> working<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> i'm<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
backline working so i'm going to be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
backline working so i'm going to be
taking<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.939> connector<00:00:27.599> off<00:00:27.720> button<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> new

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
taking this connector off button a new

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.370 
taking this connector off button a new
one<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.949> then<00:00:29.699> test<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.720> before<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.260> back

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
one on and then test in before the back

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
one on and then test in before the back
once<00:00:31.590> again<00:00:31.710> looking<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> connector<00:00:32.940> now

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
once again looking at this connector now

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.690 
once again looking at this connector now
then<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.140> he's<00:00:34.260> got<00:00:34.410> off<00:00:34.700> what

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then as you can see he's got off what

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.090 
then as you can see he's got off what
i've<00:00:35.820> done<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> remove<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.320> warmed

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
i've done to remove it it's just warmed

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
i've done to remove it it's just warmed
up<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.780> solder<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.870> iron<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.350> solder

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
up with solder and iron and some solder

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.940 
up with solder and iron and some solder
and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.910> plastic<00:00:42.090> part<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.440> melted

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and the plastic part of it so I'm melted

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830 
and the plastic part of it so I'm melted
and<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> came<00:00:44.370> off<00:00:44.670> after<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.600> were<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and it came off after they were just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.619 
and it came off after they were just
cleaning<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.610> there<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:48.059> now

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
cleaning up and there we go really now

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
cleaning up and there we go really now
the<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:49.020> connector<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.949> i'm<00:00:52.949> going

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the new connector is in here i'm going

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.590 
the new connector is in here i'm going
to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.699> posting<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.600> place<00:00:55.160> next<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to be posting that in place next so that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
to be posting that in place next so that
i<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.170> solder<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> back<00:00:58.829> into<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
i can solder it back into place on the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.930 
i can solder it back into place on the
main<00:00:59.969> board<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.949> exactly<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.190> location<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
main board in exactly this location and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
main board in exactly this location and
then<00:01:03.329> we'll<00:01:03.719> move<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.619> that's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
then we'll move on to see if that's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
then we'll move on to see if that's
fixed<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.930> with

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fixed things right so here we are with

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.510 
fixed things right so here we are with
the<00:01:07.860> new<00:01:08.220> connector<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.950> solving<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.310> place

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the new connector on solving into place

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.850 
the new connector on solving into place
very<00:01:11.549> nicely<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:13.409> isn't<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> nicest<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.729> in

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
very nicely it isn't the nicest look in

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
very nicely it isn't the nicest look in
result<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> world<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> solid<00:01:17.939> two

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
result in the world but it's a solid two

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
result in the world but it's a solid two
is<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> work<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.869> fine<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> main

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is going to work just fine the main

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
is going to work just fine the main
thing<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.840> well<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> main<00:01:22.020> reason<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
thing is well the main reason for that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
thing is well the main reason for that
really<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> solder<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> has

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really is because of the solder and has

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
really is because of the solder and has
obviously<00:01:25.049> been<00:01:25.200> done<00:01:25.380> by<00:01:25.560> hand<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.729> opposed

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
obviously been done by hand as opposed

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.840 
obviously been done by hand as opposed
to<00:01:27.890> go<00:01:28.890> through<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> manufacturing<00:01:29.820> process

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to go through the manufacturing process

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.899 
to go through the manufacturing process
which<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> pretty<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.890> through<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> big<00:01:32.520> oven

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
which is pretty much through a big oven

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
which is pretty much through a big oven
that<00:01:33.150> warms<00:01:33.479> things<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.960> makes<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> sort<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that warms things up makes the sort of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.270 
that warms things up makes the sort of
solder<00:01:35.939> joints<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:37.140> melt<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> they<00:01:38.189> had

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
solder joints here all melt and they had

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.149 
solder joints here all melt and they had
not<00:01:38.430> been<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.759> nice<00:01:38.909> looking<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> anyway

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
not been very nice looking so anyway

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
not been very nice looking so anyway
that's<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.549> next<00:01:42.329> we're<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> be

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that's that's next we're going to be

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
that's that's next we're going to be
testing<00:01:43.380> things<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.100> whether<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
testing things out to see whether the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.789 
testing things out to see whether the
back<00:01:45.000> line<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> work<00:01:45.540> okay<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.899> switching<00:01:46.470> back

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
back line is work okay so switching back

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.179 
back line is work okay so switching back
on<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.689> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.560> apple<00:01:49.979> symbol

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
on here if you can see the apple symbol

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.889 
on here if you can see the apple symbol
just<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.820> connector

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
just about there the connector

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.950 
just about there the connector
replacement<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:54.990> been<00:01:55.140> successful<00:01:56.960> okay

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
replacement has been successful okay

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
replacement has been successful okay
here<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:58.979> s<00:01:59.189> that's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here we are back in you know s that's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.530 
here we are back in you know s that's
fine<00:02:00.439> still<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.829> problem<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> backlight

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
fine still a problem with a backlight
