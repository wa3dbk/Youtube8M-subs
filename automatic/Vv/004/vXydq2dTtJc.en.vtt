00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.929
 the course of the national team in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 2010 we did not expect their course 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.560
 maybe it's going to be a house this price 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 compared to the results 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.769
 I kept a good memory of the match 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 against ivory caen is that the favorite 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.399
 is the Ivory Coast can not be 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.559
 hide it everyone is aware 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.640
 and also the kinky ghana anyway a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 big team on the African continent 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 so maybe Zambia too which is 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 who and title holder therefore the team a34 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 which stands out there have always been 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 favorites but I think since 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.780
 a few years conditioning 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.230
 african with me 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.750
 who was able to big nations as per 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.070
 example in 2010 air everyone 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.829
 some resent that the coast 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.440
 of ivory wins the tournament this implies 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:09.840
 has won now there are more small 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:12.130
 positive nations 1 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.230
 always in the world to see things 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 on the bright side I think having 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.040
 experienced players who already have 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.300
 participated in several cases we already have 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.190
 done in the end of the can I think that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.230
 that's very important for the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.740
 management team management management 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.350
 of the group 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940
 so here we all know it's a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.500
 good team I think the best 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.690
 team on the mainland continent 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.670
 African to today so the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.660
 match is announced it looks difficult 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.680
 I think it's an asset for them 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.229
 because they still have a 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.970
 experience of this competition 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.500
 they have players who play in the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.520
 great clubs and in big big 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.830
 championships in europe 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.060
 so it's clear that in this area 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.550
 we will say that we are inferior by 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.480
 report to this team but here is no 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.480
 days with our strengths and 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.140
 walcott i know well it's someone 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.380
 who is very demanding and who knows 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.910
 well his work 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.110
 he knows very well the players of the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.930
 ivory coast one is confident has been to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.900
 their heads for a moment I think 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.570
 How good is it that the préfet 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.150
 on it and we will be well prepared 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.490
 on these two matches on this match there 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.100
 so I think he'll give us some 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.980
 indications vis-à-vis the group and 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.620
 players and that's going to let us go 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.819
 allow us just to be able to 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.659
 power 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.969
 to have to find the fault is 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.389
 precisely against and their suffering and 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.670
 the coach I think the coach there 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.870
 is we better than we are 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.819
 but also the weaknesses of this 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 team so of course it can be a 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.219
 asset he'll maybe tell us about on 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290
 what points supported to try to 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.950
 fail so so I hope that 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.950
 it will be a force world
