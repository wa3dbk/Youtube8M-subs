00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
 heil hello everyone is the one who 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.859
 is today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 new common tariffs on medicine 2 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.970
 so today it will be a bit special 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 I will make an opening session of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.980
 duchy fork boxes because there was a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.719
 not long ago and in fact there is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 had all the bosses finally there was a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.090
 maximum of bumps ch tis I believe and a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.199
 maximum of medicine ch 5 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 so it depends on the markdowns we were going 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.250
 so for example went to the map 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 Orc I went so ch ch where he hoisted 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.650
 there were bumps and so there was 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 full of schaeffer everywhere so I 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 am made a maximum of local chefs 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 so as you can see I have a mac 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 it's a max a max of two boxes of the ch 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 is so strong more than one inventory 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.430
 whole is not bad and by the way 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.469

 fighting horse but actually I'm getting 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 a recording has messed up so I'm 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.360

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.519
 now but I showed you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.840
 that he's ready because I'm doing them 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.350
 parchment of blessing that would make me a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 little big fakers because otherwise I 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.530
