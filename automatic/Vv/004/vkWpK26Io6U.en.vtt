00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.740
 dynamically changing site background like this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.400
 It looks like an example of a small site 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.450
 here with vertical scrolling we 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.290
 we see that the background of the site we have smoothly 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.610
 changing more than the further color again 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:30.800
 changed to scroll more and color again 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 changing if you start scrolling up 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.240
 the color will also change how is done 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.850

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.100
 our items need to be arranged with 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.800
 the same gap I did with 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 1000 pixels away 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.200
 if you look 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.860
 we see that this text and block is worth 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.659
 1000 pixels from the top edge 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:14.100
 scroll further next with us 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.920
 worth two thousand and 3 3 thousand first 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 the set of items I arranged within 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.670

 I prepared our images in advance 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.459
 they are really that size 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.189

 bottom up, that is, the first will be this 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:10.650
 the bottommost picture here is just 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.760
 colored background then this background then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.319
 this 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.549
 well, at the end will be the topmost element 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.930
 here you can sort them 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.699
 sort by dragging 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 waist we need to animate 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:31.199

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:53.280
 thousand since the elements i have arranged 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:58.079
 after 1000 pixels initial 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.139
 position set approximately at the level here 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.939
 these first elements they cost me 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.949
 300 pixels high of this top edge 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:14.180
 accordingly here we also put 300 but 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:14.180
 maybe 350 is possible only with a minus sign 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.630
 go to the view mode and start 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.500

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:47.820
 leafing through the background has changed again 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.820
