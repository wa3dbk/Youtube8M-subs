00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
been when I've taken these ideas and

how<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> approach<00:00:47.460> something<00:00:48.050> instead<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
how I approach something instead of just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.040 
how I approach something instead of just
having<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.070> head<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.610> sit<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
having that in my head I sit down and I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
having that in my head I sit down and I
write<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.469> down<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> write<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
write it down and I write it out and I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
write it down and I write it out and I
find<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.079> helps<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:56.160> organize<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> my

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
find that it helps to organize all of my

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.459 
find that it helps to organize all of my
thoughts<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.620> way<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.840> it<00:01:00.840> gives<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.260> some

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the end of all of that i think he was

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.750 
the end of all of that i think he was
like<00:02:19.440> three<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.830> four<00:02:19.860> pages<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.489> was<00:02:20.580> fight

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
like three or four pages it was fight

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
like three or four pages it was fight
it's<00:02:21.000> Christine<00:02:21.390> Caine<00:02:21.630> by<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.989> end<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it's Christine Caine by the end of the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.400 
it's Christine Caine by the end of the
whole<00:02:22.830> worksheet<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.400> had<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:24.090> clearer<00:02:24.690> idea<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
whole worksheet I had a clearer idea of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.830 
whole worksheet I had a clearer idea of
what<00:02:25.650> i<00:02:26.370> wanted<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.850> attain<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.480> year<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
what i wanted to attain in that year and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.270 
what i wanted to attain in that year and
what<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> was<00:02:28.380> looking<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.880> i<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.270> that

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
what I was looking for so i think that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
what I was looking for so i think that
sitting<00:02:32.280> down<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.970> going<00:02:33.540> through<00:02:33.690> questions

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
sitting down and going through questions

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.850 
sitting down and going through questions
and<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.040> giving<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.090> some<00:02:36.270> thought<00:02:36.860> really

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and really giving it some thought really

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.610 
and really giving it some thought really
can<00:02:38.010> help<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.340> figure<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.780> where<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:40.230> in

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
can help you figure out where you are in

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.610 
can help you figure out where you are in
your<00:02:40.940> artful<00:02:41.940> journey<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.959> where<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.410> want

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
your artful journey and where you want

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.590 
your artful journey and where you want
to<00:02:43.709> go<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:46.640> think<00:02:47.640> sometimes<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.299> have<00:02:48.450> these

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
to go I think sometimes we have these

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570 
to go I think sometimes we have these
constructs<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.500> how<00:02:49.890> an<00:02:50.070> art<00:02:50.190> journal<00:02:50.250> page

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
constructs of how an art journal page

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.310 
constructs of how an art journal page
should<00:02:50.790> look<00:02:50.850> or<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.750> we're<00:02:51.930> supposed<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
should look or what we're supposed to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.590 
should look or what we're supposed to
use<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.650> an<00:02:52.739> art<00:02:52.890> journal<00:02:52.950> page<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:53.610> how<00:02:54.299> deep

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
use in an art journal page or how deep

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.420 
use in an art journal page or how deep
it's<00:02:54.780> supposed<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.410> or<00:02:55.739> how<00:02:55.920> messy<00:02:56.310> it's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
it's supposed to be or how messy it's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.220 
it's supposed to be or how messy it's
supposed<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.209> i<00:02:57.570> really<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:58.080> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
supposed to be and i really think that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.289 
supposed to be and i really think that
we<00:02:58.620> need<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.700> basics<00:03:00.150> we

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
we need to get down to the basics we

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.090 
we need to get down to the basics we
need<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.570> get<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> what<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.410> personally

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
need to get down to what we personally

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.539 
need to get down to what we personally
believe<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.610> find<00:03:03.269> out<00:03:03.480> how<00:03:03.720> much<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.049> is

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
believe and find out how much of that is

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.770 
believe and find out how much of that is
stuff<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.580> we've<00:03:05.850> been<00:03:06.000> told<00:03:06.299> by<00:03:06.600> other

a lot of questions and the workshop
really<00:03:20.760> consists<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.480> lot<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> my<00:03:22.260> own

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
really consists of a lot of my own

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.370 
really consists of a lot of my own
experiments<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.890> wanderings<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.220> questions

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
experiments and wanderings and questions

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.630 
experiments and wanderings and questions
explorations<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.530> myself<00:03:28.980> where<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.310> am<00:03:29.490> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
explorations of myself where I am and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.510 
explorations of myself where I am and
where<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.850> going<00:03:30.210> as<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> journal<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:30.960> so<00:03:31.800> it's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
where I'm going as a journal or so it's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.760 
where I'm going as a journal or so it's
really<00:03:32.850> been<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.180> an<00:03:33.270> organic<00:03:33.780> process<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
really been on an organic process and I

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.290 
really been on an organic process and I
think<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.100> really<00:03:35.310> starts<00:03:35.790> with<00:03:35.880> sitting<00:03:36.180> out

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
think it really starts with sitting out

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.820 
think it really starts with sitting out
and<00:03:36.390> being<00:03:36.540> honest<00:03:36.930> with<00:03:37.020> yourself<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.560> where

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
and being honest with yourself of where

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.980 
and being honest with yourself of where
you<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.190> what<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.180> want<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.780> where
