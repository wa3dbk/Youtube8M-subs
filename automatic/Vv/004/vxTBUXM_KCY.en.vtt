as<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> screen<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.980> are<00:00:35.159> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
as you see on the screen they are in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
as you see on the screen they are in
order<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.999> we<00:00:36.359> say<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.719> order<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
order as we say in my order as on the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.950 
order as we say in my order as on the
screen<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> his<00:00:38.339> celestial<00:00:38.730> dragons<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.929> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
screen of his celestial dragons so I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.439 
screen of his celestial dragons so I
think<00:00:40.109> the<00:00:40.409> first<00:00:40.589> one<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.859> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.579> water

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
think the first one is going to be water

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.639 
think the first one is going to be water
and<00:00:42.719> fire<00:00:43.730> Vanveen<00:00:44.730> next<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.179> may<00:00:45.929> be<00:00:45.989> mono

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and fire Vanveen next one may be mono

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.809 
and fire Vanveen next one may be mono
water<00:00:47.239> then<00:00:48.239> maybe<00:00:48.510> mono<00:00:49.019> air<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.519> maybe

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
water then maybe mono air and then maybe

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.779 
water then maybe mono air and then maybe
mono<00:00:51.120> fire<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.839> I'm<00:00:52.019> not<00:00:52.170> sure<00:00:52.440> yet<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.890> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.740 
earth or something then we got another
one<00:01:50.760> so<00:01:51.330> I'm<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.780> sure<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.160 

a<00:01:57.040> nemesis<00:01:58.040> or<00:01:58.220> something<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:59.330> or<00:01:59.930> maybe

a nemesis or something but or maybe

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.560 
a nemesis or something but or maybe
another<00:02:00.590> epic<00:02:01.160> chest<00:02:01.550> epic<00:02:01.910> or<00:02:02.150> something

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
then we have another one so I think this

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.050 
then we have another one so I think this
is<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.530> be<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.710> chest<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.370> pic<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.910> looks

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
is going to be a chest a pic it looks

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.710 
is going to be a chest a pic it looks
like<00:02:08.509> its<00:02:08.750> air<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.380> earth<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> yeah<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.590> after

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
like its air and earth so yeah so after

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.500 
like its air and earth so yeah so after
here<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.900> one<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> armors<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.390> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
here is one of the armors so for this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.920 
here is one of the armors so for this
epic<00:02:17.900> boss<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.920> head<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.930> then

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
epic boss here is the head for it then

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
epic boss here is the head for it then
below<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.440> think<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.790> a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
below I think it's going this is a

below I think it's going this is a
nemesis<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.820> below<00:02:26.240> we<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.170> another<00:02:27.860> armor

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
nemesis so below we have another armor

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.860 
nemesis so below we have another armor
so<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.860> had<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.610> looks<00:02:31.940> again<00:02:32.209> like<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> mono

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
so we had this looks again like a mono

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.800 
so we had this looks again like a mono
fire<00:02:33.230> then<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.459> another<00:02:34.610> nemesis<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.630> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
fire then we have another nemesis and a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.130 
fire then we have another nemesis and a
bunch<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.110> awesome<00:02:36.320> stuff<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.810> below

bunch of awesome stuff so here below

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.650 
bunch of awesome stuff so here below
maybe<00:02:39.470> another<00:02:40.160> nemesis<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.020> water<00:02:42.560> or

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
maybe another nemesis for a water or

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.960 
maybe another nemesis for a water or
something<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.830> have<00:02:46.040> another<00:02:46.250> ethic

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
something then we have another ethic

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.060 
something then we have another ethic
boss<00:02:47.180> fits<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:48.050> looks<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:50.140> maybe<00:02:51.140> water<00:02:51.650> or

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
boss fits this looks like maybe water or

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.430 
boss fits this looks like maybe water or
something<00:02:52.450> all<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.750> these<00:02:53.840> looks<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.200> we

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
something all of these looks like we

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.650 
something all of these looks like we
have<00:02:54.560> maybe<00:02:54.800> water<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.630> next

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
have maybe water in it and then the next

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.280 
have maybe water in it and then the next
one<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.260> water<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.280> fire<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.940> think<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.660> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
one is water and fire I think so the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.380 
one is water and fire I think so the
epic<00:03:00.530> boss<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.010> after<00:03:01.670> another<00:03:02.060> named

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
epic boss and after another named

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.949 
epic boss and after another named
nemesis<00:03:03.019> may<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:03.680> mono<00:03:04.040> earth<00:03:04.340> or<00:03:04.730> something

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959
