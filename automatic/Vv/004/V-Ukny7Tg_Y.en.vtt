consoles are totally different you know

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.870

lined<00:05:02.180> or<00:05:02.449> streamlined<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.560> mean<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.860> say

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
lined or streamlined I mean to say

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.250 
lined or streamlined I mean to say
operating<00:05:04.699> systems<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.750> don't<00:05:05.990> have<00:05:06.229> a

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
operating systems that don't have a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.020 
operating systems that don't have a
billion<00:05:06.770> tasks<00:05:07.310> running<00:05:07.520> in<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.789> background

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
billion tasks running in the background

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.320 
billion tasks running in the background
so<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.510> could<00:05:08.810> do<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> lot<00:05:09.320> more<00:05:09.380> on<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:10.330> console

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
so you could do a lot more on a console

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.710 
so you could do a lot more on a console
with<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> lot<00:05:12.410> less<00:05:12.580> Hardware<00:05:13.580> capability<00:05:14.270> you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
with a lot less Hardware capability you

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.650 
with a lot less Hardware capability you
understand<00:05:15.110> what<00:05:15.199> I'm<00:05:15.320> saying<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.880> it'll<00:05:17.510> be

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
understand what I'm saying so it'll be

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.540 
understand what I'm saying so it'll be
interesting<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:18.199> see<00:05:18.500> man<00:05:18.740> I'm<00:05:18.949> hoping<00:05:19.370> that

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550
