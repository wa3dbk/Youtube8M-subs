00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
more just I don't know I guess it

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.370 
more just I don't know I guess it
depends<00:04:52.180> on<00:04:52.360> what<00:04:52.539> kind<00:04:52.569> of<00:04:52.750> looks<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.169> you

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
depends on what kind of looks this you

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.629 
depends on what kind of looks this you
create<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.860> second<00:04:54.190> way<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.310> could<00:04:54.490> create

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
you could create more everyday looks

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.040 
you could create more everyday looks
this<00:04:59.889> one<00:05:00.159> reminds<00:05:00.580> me<00:05:00.909> a<00:05:01.180> little<00:05:01.479> bit<00:05:01.599> of<00:05:01.900> the
