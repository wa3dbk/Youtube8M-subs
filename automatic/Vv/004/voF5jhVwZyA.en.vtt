that you might be using so it may be a
little<00:00:23.760> different<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.180> your<00:00:24.330> world<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.840> you're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
run across a need to do this and I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.550 
run across a need to do this and I
thought<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.060> worth<00:00:30.210> worth<00:00:31.109> talking<00:00:31.349> about

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
thought was worth worth talking about

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.970 
thought was worth worth talking about
one<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.780> readers<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.290> asked<00:00:34.559> this

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
question from the website so I thought

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380 
question from the website so I thought
I'd<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> video<00:00:37.770> real<00:00:38.129> quick<00:00:38.309> okay<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.059> what

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I'd do a video real quick okay so what

we want to listen to the vocal in us at

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.979 
we want to listen to the vocal in us at
a<00:00:56.730> certain<00:00:57.030> level<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> singer<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> going

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a certain level but the singer is going

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
a certain level but the singer is going
to<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> higher<00:00:58.710> level<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.160> his

to want it at a higher level in his

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
to want it at a higher level in his
headphone<00:00:59.789> mix<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.780> certainly

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
headphone mix that's certainly

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.219 
headphone mix that's certainly
understandable<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> only<00:01:03.930> way<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> do

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
understandable and the only way to do

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.649 
understandable and the only way to do
that<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.489> headphone<00:01:06.210> mix

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that is to actually have a headphone mix

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
that is to actually have a headphone mix
now<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.979> assuming<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
now this is assuming you don't have a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510 
now this is assuming you don't have a
more<00:01:09.030> advanced<00:01:09.560> headphone<00:01:10.560> mixing<00:01:11.310> system

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
more advanced headphone mixing system

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
more advanced headphone mixing system
like<00:01:11.880> an<00:01:12.060> aviom<00:01:12.750> system<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> hear<00:01:14.070> back

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
like an aviom system or a hear back

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
like an aviom system or a hear back
system<00:01:14.640> which<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.360> studios<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.110> but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
system which some studios will have but

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
system which some studios will have but
most<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> us<00:01:16.770> home<00:01:16.950> studio<00:01:17.280> folks<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
most of us home studio folks that's a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
most of us home studio folks that's a
little<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.080> don't<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.920> have

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
little over the top we don't really have

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
little over the top we don't really have
the<00:01:20.460> bandwidth<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.299> handle<00:01:21.509> something<00:01:22.020> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the bandwidth to handle something like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
the bandwidth to handle something like
that<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> cache<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.420> quite<00:01:24.600> honest

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that or the cache and to be quite honest

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.950 
that or the cache and to be quite honest
but<00:01:25.880> there's<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.090> ways<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
but there's still ways to do it what you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480 
but there's still ways to do it what you
do<00:01:28.140> need<00:01:28.320> though<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> keep<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
do need though and something to keep in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
do need though and something to keep in
mind<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.150> need<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.750> sort<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
mind is you do need some sort of a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
mind is you do need some sort of a
headphone<00:01:31.590> amp<00:01:32.540> Presonus<00:01:33.540> makes<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.810> couple

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
headphone amp Presonus makes a couple

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
headphone amp Presonus makes a couple
there's<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> HP<00:01:34.590> four<00:01:34.829> that's<00:01:35.070> four<00:01:35.280> channels

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there's the HP four that's four channels

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
there's the HP four that's four channels
which<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> great<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.900> six<00:01:37.140> channel

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
which is great they make a six channel

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.950 
which is great they make a six channel
version<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> idea<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
version as well and the idea here is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
version as well and the idea here is
you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.770> create<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.130> own<00:01:41.369> mix<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you're going to create your own mix and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
you're going to create your own mix and
send<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> separate<00:01:42.810> headphone<00:01:43.170> amp<00:01:43.380> then

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
send it to a separate headphone amp then

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.690 
send it to a separate headphone amp then
within<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.040> headphone<00:01:44.340> jack<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> your

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
within the headphone jack on your

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.120 
within the headphone jack on your
interface<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
interface and then that's what the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370 
interface and then that's what the
singers<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> plug<00:01:47.880> into<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.990> listen<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
singers going to plug into to listen to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.880 
singers going to plug into to listen to
so<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.149> well<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.509> off

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
so how do we do that well first off

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
so how do we do that well first off
aside<00:01:52.890> from<00:01:52.920> needing<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> headphone<00:01:53.579> amp<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
aside from needing a headphone amp you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
aside from needing a headphone amp you
need<00:01:54.540> an<00:01:54.630> interface<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.470> allow<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
need an interface that will allow for a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
need an interface that will allow for a
separate<00:01:57.180> output<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.899> interface

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
separate output so if your interface

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
separate output so if your interface
only<00:01:58.469> has<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> pair<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> outputs<00:01:59.369> your<00:02:00.180> main

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
only has a pair of outputs your main

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
only has a pair of outputs your main
left<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.259> there's<00:02:01.409> no<00:02:01.590> other

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
left and right out and there's no other

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
left and right out and there's no other
outputs<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.060> able

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
outputs then you're not going to be able

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
outputs then you're not going to be able
to<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.380> you've<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.649> anything

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
to do this but if you've got anything

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
to do this but if you've got anything
with<00:02:05.159> an<00:02:05.280> extra<00:02:05.610> set<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.850> line<00:02:06.119> outputs<00:02:06.630> then

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
with an extra set of line outputs then

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
with an extra set of line outputs then
you're<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.079> good<00:02:07.110> shape<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> way<00:02:08.429> we

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
you're in good shape and so the way we

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.589 
you're in good shape and so the way we
go<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> we're<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> use

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
go about this is we're going to use

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.910 
go about this is we're going to use
busses

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
busses

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.300 
busses
to<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.730> our<00:02:12.090> our<00:02:12.420> send<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.770> come<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.010> here

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to do our our send so if we come in here

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.559 
to do our our send so if we come in here
hold<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.790> command<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:17.090> stop<00:02:18.090> playback<00:02:18.300> here

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
hold down command and stop playback here

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
hold down command and stop playback here
for<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.720> second<00:02:18.959> hold<00:02:19.860> down<00:02:20.010> command<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.550> click

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
for a second hold down command and click

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.150 
for a second hold down command and click
on<00:02:20.970> assignments<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> show<00:02:23.010> us

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
on assignments that's going to show us

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.920 
on assignments that's going to show us
all<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.459> our<00:02:23.520> buses<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.030> let's<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.330> find<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
all of our buses so let's just find a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530 
all of our buses so let's just find a
free<00:02:25.620> row<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.819> we're<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:27.450> our

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
free row that we're going to use as our

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.690 
free row that we're going to use as our
headphone<00:02:27.840> mix<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> singer<00:02:28.610> alright<00:02:29.610> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
headphone mix for the singer alright so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
headphone mix for the singer alright so
we're<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> go<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.150> B<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.380> what<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:31.860> do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
we're going to go with B now what we do

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.330 
we're going to go with B now what we do
here<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.459> simply<00:02:33.450> add<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:34.319> bus<00:02:35.130> send<00:02:36.050> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
here is we simply add a bus send to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.420 
here is we simply add a bus send to
these<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:40.200> send<00:02:40.680> channel<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.160> B

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
these this this send channel here on B

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.070 
these this this send channel here on B
so<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> select<00:02:42.300> all<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.750> tracks<00:02:42.989> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
so I'm going to select all the tracks I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
so I'm going to select all the tracks I
want<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.319> send<00:02:43.530> which<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> pretty<00:02:43.980> much<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.250> my

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
want to send which is pretty much all my

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.370 
want to send which is pretty much all my
audio<00:02:44.700> tracks<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.269> I'm<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> hold<00:02:46.319> down

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
audio tracks and I'm going to hold down

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.250 
audio tracks and I'm going to hold down
shift<00:02:46.800> option<00:02:47.340> which<00:02:47.790> lets<00:02:47.819> me<00:02:48.060> apply<00:02:48.420> what

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
shift option which lets me apply what

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.809 
shift option which lets me apply what
I'm<00:02:49.319> about<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:50.190> those<00:02:50.340> selected

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
I'm about to do to all those selected

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.030 
I'm about to do to all those selected
tracks<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:52.019> going<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.200> select<00:02:52.380> an<00:02:52.769> output

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
tracks and I'm going to select an output

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.520 
tracks and I'm going to select an output
here<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:54.510> normally<00:02:54.870> when<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.049> use<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.170> send

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
here now normally when you use a send

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.930 
here now normally when you use a send
for<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.799> reverb<00:02:56.160> or<00:02:56.370> anything<00:02:56.670> else<00:02:56.819> you're

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
for a reverb or anything else you're

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.550 
for a reverb or anything else you're
going<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> use<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.269> bus<00:02:57.569> which<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.410> can

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
going to use a bus which you can

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.420 
going to use a bus which you can
certainly<00:02:58.739> do<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.959> buses<00:03:01.350> stay<00:03:01.680> inside<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> Pro

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
certainly do but buses stay inside a Pro

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.800 
certainly do but buses stay inside a Pro
Tools<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.819> don't<00:03:02.940> actually<00:03:03.090> go<00:03:03.330> out<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.720> an

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
Tools and don't actually go out to an

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
Tools and don't actually go out to an
interface<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:05.040> an<00:03:05.130> output<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.519> your<00:03:05.549> system

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
interface or to an output on your system

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
interface or to an output on your system
so<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> need<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.720> actually<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> easiest

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
so you need that actually the easiest

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.840 
so you need that actually the easiest
way<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.220> set<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> an

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
way to do this is to set this to an

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.640 
way to do this is to set this to an
actual<00:03:09.150> output<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.959> I've<00:03:10.080> got<00:03:10.230> an<00:03:10.319> interface

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
actual output so I've got an interface

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.370 
actual output so I've got an interface
connected<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.220> has<00:03:11.430> multiple<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.049> 18

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
connected that has multiple up to 18

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.720 
connected that has multiple up to 18
outputs<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.519> going<00:03:14.640> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
outputs on it so I'm just going to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.349 
outputs on it so I'm just going to
select<00:03:14.880> outputs<00:03:15.510> 3<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:15.959> 4<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:17.209> my<00:03:18.209> interface

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
select outputs 3 and 4 of my interface

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.810 
select outputs 3 and 4 of my interface
so<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.750> click<00:03:22.109> there<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.380> say<00:03:22.799> go<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.670> now

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
so I click there I say go for it and now

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.360 
so I click there I say go for it and now
it's<00:03:24.060> created<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.600> send<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.170> output<00:03:25.560> 3<00:03:25.799> &amp;<00:03:25.920> 4<00:03:26.100> on

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it's created to send to output 3 &amp; 4 on

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's created to send to output 3 &amp; 4 on
all<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.209> these<00:03:27.329> tracks<00:03:27.570> now<00:03:28.560> I'll<00:03:28.709> put<00:03:28.859> 3<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.160> 4

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
all of these tracks now I'll put 3 and 4

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.560 
all of these tracks now I'll put 3 and 4
is<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.670> quarter-inch<00:03:29.940> output<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.480> the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
is just a quarter-inch output on the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.270 
is just a quarter-inch output on the
back<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:30.900> interface<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.769> can<00:03:31.950> connect

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
back of my interface and I can connect

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.880 
back of my interface and I can connect
via<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.820> couple<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.239> balanced<00:03:33.510> cables<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.440> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
via a couple of balanced cables to a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.759 
via a couple of balanced cables to a
headphone<00:03:35.250> amp<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.790> choice<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.750> then<00:03:37.440> we're

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
headphone amp of choice and then we're

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.590 
headphone amp of choice and then we're
good<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.010> go<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.880> way<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.120> works<00:03:39.390> is

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
good to go and the way this works is

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.259 
good to go and the way this works is
you'll<00:03:39.870> see<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.769> you've<00:03:41.519> got<00:03:41.579> levels<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:43.070> 4

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you'll see that you've got levels here 4

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.300 
you'll see that you've got levels here 4
for<00:03:45.269> each<00:03:45.359> of<00:03:45.540> these<00:03:45.660> these<00:03:46.260> tracks<00:03:46.680> so

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
for each of these these tracks so

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.740 
for each of these these tracks so
essentially<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.150> doing<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
essentially what this is doing is this

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.470 
essentially what this is doing is this
is<00:03:48.900> saying<00:03:49.109> what<00:03:49.230> level<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.850> what<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.329> this

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
is saying what level of the what is this

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.809 
is saying what level of the what is this
the<00:03:51.810> click<00:03:52.170> track<00:03:52.470> how<00:03:53.310> much<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.670> click

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
the click track how much of the click

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.610 
the click track how much of the click
track<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.510> mix<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.500> how

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
track is going to that mix this is how

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.410 
track is going to that mix this is how
much<00:03:55.769> kick<00:03:55.980> drum<00:03:56.220> snare<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.299> just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
much kick drum snare and so you just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.780 
much kick drum snare and so you just
come<00:03:57.569> through<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:57.959> build<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.500> mix<00:03:58.769> for<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
come through and you build a mix for the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.280 
come through and you build a mix for the
singer<00:04:00.090> perhaps<00:04:00.269> he<00:04:00.480> doesn't<00:04:00.750> want<00:04:00.870> drums<00:04:01.170> at

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
singer perhaps he doesn't want drums at

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
singer perhaps he doesn't want drums at
all<00:04:01.410> for<00:04:01.620> some<00:04:01.650> weird<00:04:01.920> reason<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.430> he<00:04:03.299> just

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
all for some weird reason and he just

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.110 
all for some weird reason and he just
wants<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.780> hear<00:04:03.959> his<00:04:04.170> vocal<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:05.819> guitar

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
wants to hear his vocal and the guitar

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
wants to hear his vocal and the guitar
you<00:04:06.510> could<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:07.200> him<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:08.010> just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
you could do that for him and you just

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.400 
you could do that for him and you just
come<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.370> here<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:09.660> turn<00:04:10.019> up<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.170> vocal

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
come in here and you turn up the vocal

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.140 
come in here and you turn up the vocal
go<00:04:10.739> find<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.040> guitar<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.519> turn<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:11.790> up<00:04:12.000> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
go find a guitar and turn that up and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.120 
go find a guitar and turn that up and
that's<00:04:12.600> his<00:04:12.840> mix<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.260> now<00:04:13.350> he's<00:04:13.590> hearing<00:04:13.859> this

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
that's his mix so now he's hearing this

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.069 
that's his mix so now he's hearing this
regardless<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.450> mix<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:15.900> that

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
regardless of what your mix is that

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.180 
regardless of what your mix is that
you're<00:04:16.289> hearing<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.799> control<00:04:17.160> room

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
you're hearing in the control room

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.860 
you're hearing in the control room
through<00:04:17.970> your<00:04:18.120> headphones<00:04:18.450> or<00:04:18.600> through<00:04:18.750> your

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
through your headphones or through your

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.960 
through your headphones or through your
studio<00:04:19.140> monitors<00:04:19.560> now<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> couple<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.849> things

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you can see here we've got level going

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.580 
you can see here we've got level going
to<00:04:45.240> all<00:04:45.390> these<00:04:45.690> sins<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.200> can<00:04:46.290> see<00:04:46.440> your

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
to all these sins you can see your

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.320 
to all these sins you can see your
levels<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.070> these<00:04:47.580> are<00:04:47.760> these<00:04:47.970> are<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.240> the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
levels and these are these are just the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.270 
levels and these are these are just the
levels<00:04:48.630> going<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.500> are<00:04:49.650> hitting<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.070> sin

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
levels going that are hitting the sin

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.440 
levels going that are hitting the sin
and<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.700> actual<00:04:50.880> volume<00:04:51.300> that's

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
and this is the actual volume that's

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.360 
and this is the actual volume that's
going<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.260> right<00:04:52.470> here<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.860> volumes<00:04:53.160> all<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
going so right here the volumes all the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.190 
going so right here the volumes all the
way<00:04:53.460> down<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:53.850> he's<00:04:54.000> not<00:04:54.090> hearing<00:04:54.540> this<00:04:54.720> this

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
way down so he's not hearing this this

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.140 
way down so he's not hearing this this
track<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:56.130> would<00:04:56.370> allow<00:04:56.550> him<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.790> hear<00:04:57.060> it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
track this would allow him to hear it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.760 
track this would allow him to hear it
but<00:04:57.690> we'll<00:04:57.780> notice<00:04:58.140> what<00:04:58.290> happens<00:04:58.590> when<00:04:58.740> I

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
but we'll notice what happens when I

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.030 
but we'll notice what happens when I
solo<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.370> vocal<00:05:00.260> we've<00:05:01.260> got<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.500> vocal<00:05:01.830> still

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
solo the vocal we've got the vocal still

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.130 
solo the vocal we've got the vocal still
going<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> output<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:03.120> all<00:05:03.240> of<00:05:03.390> these<00:05:03.570> you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
going to the output but all of these you

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.390 
going to the output but all of these you
can<00:05:04.260> see<00:05:04.380> there's<00:05:04.560> nothing<00:05:04.770> on<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.100> faders

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
can see there's nothing on the faders

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.160 
can see there's nothing on the faders
here<00:05:05.640> that's<00:05:06.330> because<00:05:06.720> all<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.900> these<00:05:07.110> are

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
here that's because all of these are

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.770 
here that's because all of these are
post<00:05:08.040> fader<00:05:08.400> sins<00:05:08.820> which<00:05:09.240> means<00:05:09.480> they're<00:05:09.660> only

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
post fader sins which means they're only

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.110 
post fader sins which means they're only
going<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.990> send<00:05:10.260> based<00:05:11.130> if<00:05:11.550> there's<00:05:11.790> signal

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
going to send based if there's signal

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.850 
going to send based if there's signal
going<00:05:12.360> through<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.690> main<00:05:13.200> fader<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.710> that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
going through the main fader on that

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.950 
going through the main fader on that
track<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.940> it's<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.150> same<00:05:15.300> thing<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.780> hit

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
track so it's the same thing if I hit

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.380 
track so it's the same thing if I hit
play<00:05:15.990> here<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:17.700> came<00:05:17.880> over<00:05:18.000> here<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.300> I

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
play here and I came over here and I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.640 
play here and I came over here and I
muted<00:05:18.780> this<00:05:19.610> overhead<00:05:20.610> track<00:05:21.140> that's<00:05:22.140> muted

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
muted this overhead track that's muted

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.010 
muted this overhead track that's muted
and<00:05:22.830> now<00:05:23.040> it's<00:05:23.190> not<00:05:23.340> going<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:23.790> that<00:05:23.910> output<00:05:24.330> so

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
and now it's not going to that output so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.300 
and now it's not going to that output so
that's<00:05:25.169> not<00:05:25.350> ideal<00:05:25.500> because<00:05:25.860> when<00:05:26.160> you're

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
that's not ideal because when you're

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.280 
that's not ideal because when you're
listening<00:05:26.520> while<00:05:27.510> he's<00:05:27.750> singing<00:05:28.050> you<00:05:28.169> may

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
listening while he's singing you may

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.140 
listening while he's singing you may
want<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.590> solo<00:05:29.220> something<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.640> listen<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.000> it

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
want to solo something to listen to it

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.790 
want to solo something to listen to it
you<00:05:30.630> may<00:05:30.750> want<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.960> mute<00:05:31.050> something<00:05:31.410> out<00:05:31.530> but

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
you may want to mute something out but

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.500 
you may want to mute something out but
you<00:05:31.919> want<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.100> leave<00:05:32.250> his<00:05:32.460> mix<00:05:32.790> alone<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.419> it

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
you want to leave his mix alone so it

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.700 
you want to leave his mix alone so it
doesn't<00:05:33.750> change<00:05:34.200> while<00:05:34.380> he's<00:05:34.560> singing

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
doesn't change while he's singing

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.770 
doesn't change while he's singing
obviously<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:35.850> come<00:05:36.000> over<00:05:36.030> here<00:05:36.390> just<00:05:36.630> hold

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
obviously so come over here just hold

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.930 
obviously so come over here just hold
down<00:05:36.810> option<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.350> click<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.100> this<00:05:38.220> P<00:05:38.490> here<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
down option and click on this P here and

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.260 
down option and click on this P here and
that<00:05:39.240> P<00:05:39.390> stands<00:05:39.630> for<00:05:39.720> pre<00:05:40.050> fader<00:05:40.229> now<00:05:40.919> if<00:05:41.310> we

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
that P stands for pre fader now if we

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.000 
that P stands for pre fader now if we
look<00:05:42.450> at<00:05:42.540> those<00:05:42.630> levels<00:05:42.990> up<00:05:43.110> here<00:05:43.350> I<00:05:43.380> can<00:05:43.680> solo

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
look at those levels up here I can solo

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.460 
look at those levels up here I can solo
anything<00:05:44.630> listen<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.720> just<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.290> you<00:05:46.350> can

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
anything listen to just that and you can

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.280 
anything listen to just that and you can
see<00:05:46.680> he's<00:05:46.979> still<00:05:47.190> getting<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.520> same<00:05:48.290> same

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
see he's still getting the same same

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.280 
see he's still getting the same same
signal<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:50.010> his<00:05:50.160> mix<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:50.640> so<00:05:51.360> all<00:05:51.690> he<00:05:51.840> can<00:05:51.870> when

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
signal to his mix and so all he can when

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.420 
signal to his mix and so all he can when
he<00:05:52.350> stops<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:52.740> says<00:05:52.830> hey<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.040> need<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:53.280> little

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
he stops and says hey I need a little

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.070 
he stops and says hey I need a little
more<00:05:53.520> vocal<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.000> say<00:05:54.210> hey<00:05:54.479> that's<00:05:54.630> no<00:05:54.840> problem

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
more vocal you say hey that's no problem

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.920 
more vocal you say hey that's no problem
how's<00:05:56.010> that<00:05:56.250> perfect<00:05:56.940> okay<00:05:57.390> let's<00:05:57.600> go<00:05:57.750> let's

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
how's that perfect okay let's go let's

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.750 
how's that perfect okay let's go let's
do<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.110> again<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.440> that's<00:05:58.979> that's<00:05:59.520> the

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
do it again and that's that's the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.370 
do it again and that's that's the
essence<00:05:59.970> of<00:06:00.030> doing<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.300> headphone<00:06:00.570> mix<00:06:00.780> now<00:06:01.229> as

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
essence of doing a headphone mix now as

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.050 
essence of doing a headphone mix now as
you<00:06:01.500> can<00:06:01.590> imagine<00:06:01.650> we<00:06:02.460> can<00:06:02.580> come<00:06:02.700> back<00:06:02.790> here<00:06:02.850> to

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
you can imagine we can come back here to

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.159 
you can imagine we can come back here to
assignments<00:06:03.510> if<00:06:03.570> you<00:06:03.660> have<00:06:03.750> more<00:06:03.930> than<00:06:04.020> one

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
assignments if you have more than one

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.420 
assignments if you have more than one
musician<00:06:04.560> playing<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.040> you<00:06:05.130> want<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:05.310> do<00:06:05.400> a

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
musician playing and you want to do a

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.400 
musician playing and you want to do a
separate<00:06:05.820> mix<00:06:06.030> for<00:06:06.210> each<00:06:06.300> one<00:06:06.510> of<00:06:06.540> them<00:06:06.750> that's

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
separate mix for each one of them that's

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.920 
separate mix for each one of them that's
no<00:06:07.590> problem<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:08.010> just<00:06:08.040> come<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.460> here<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.930> do

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
no problem you just come in here and do

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.360 
no problem you just come in here and do
the<00:06:10.050> same<00:06:10.229> thing<00:06:10.440> on<00:06:10.740> any<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:11.190> your<00:06:11.310> other

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
the same thing on any of your other

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.340 
the same thing on any of your other
sentence<00:06:11.880> so<00:06:12.120> we've<00:06:12.240> got<00:06:12.419> five<00:06:12.720> here<00:06:13.020> I<00:06:13.050> think

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
sentence so we've got five here I think

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.140 
sentence so we've got five here I think
you<00:06:13.440> have<00:06:13.530> another<00:06:13.710> five<00:06:13.979> available<00:06:14.220> so<00:06:15.060> you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
you have another five available so you

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.460 
you have another five available so you
could<00:06:15.270> essentially<00:06:15.540> do<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.780> mix<00:06:16.080> for<00:06:16.260> every

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
could essentially do a mix for every

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.900 
could essentially do a mix for every
member<00:06:16.620> of<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.919> band<00:06:17.160> now<00:06:17.460> that's<00:06:17.640> getting<00:06:17.760> a

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
member of the band now that's getting a

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.370 
member of the band now that's getting a
little<00:06:18.120> complex<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:18.690> in<00:06:18.750> depth<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.080> may<00:06:19.229> not

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
little complex and in depth you may not

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.930 
little complex and in depth you may not
want<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:19.650> do<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:19.919> just<00:06:20.100> for<00:06:20.310> simplicity<00:06:20.760> sake

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
want to do that just for simplicity sake

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.940 
want to do that just for simplicity sake
but<00:06:21.570> it's<00:06:21.720> good<00:06:21.930> it's<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.410> good<00:06:22.530> idea<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.830> know

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
but it's good it's a good idea to know

but it's good it's a good idea to know
how<00:06:23.190> to<00:06:23.250> do<00:06:23.460> that<00:06:23.610> so<00:06:24.120> that's<00:06:24.300> how<00:06:24.479> you<00:06:24.540> do<00:06:24.660> it

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
how to do that so that's how you do it

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.480 
how to do that so that's how you do it
in<00:06:24.870> Pro<00:06:25.020> Tools<00:06:25.050> any<00:06:25.530> other<00:06:25.740> doll<00:06:25.979> is<00:06:26.190> pretty

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
in Pro Tools any other doll is pretty

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.270 
in Pro Tools any other doll is pretty
much<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.850> same<00:06:27.060> but<00:06:27.750> maybe<00:06:28.560> just<00:06:29.160> slightly

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
much the same but maybe just slightly

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.590 
much the same but maybe just slightly
different<00:06:29.820> in<00:06:29.880> different<00:06:30.120> ways<00:06:30.240> that<00:06:30.479> it

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
different in different ways that it

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.570 
different in different ways that it
executes<00:06:30.840> sit<00:06:31.200> but<00:06:31.350> that's<00:06:32.010> it<00:06:32.220> so<00:06:32.400> hopefully

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
executes sit but that's it so hopefully

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.650 
executes sit but that's it so hopefully
that<00:06:32.820> was<00:06:32.910> helpful<00:06:32.940> for<00:06:33.210> you<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.570> maybe

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
that was helpful for you and maybe

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.260 
that was helpful for you and maybe
you'll<00:06:33.900> have<00:06:34.590> an<00:06:34.740> option<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.070> use<00:06:35.970> that<00:06:36.150> at

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
you'll have an option to use that at

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.110 
you'll have an option to use that at
some<00:06:36.419> point
