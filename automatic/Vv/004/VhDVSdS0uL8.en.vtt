00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.450
 [Music] 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 little trick I explain you very 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.650
 just how to block a number 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.089
 under android so it's about calls 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 incoming from a certain person of no 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.380
 within a certain number also the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
 anonymous calls in general 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.170
 from different different 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.500
 people and also the blocking of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.720
 sms from a certain person 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 so basic on android what is it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 we have as possibilities you go 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 under your contacts to block a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.620
 no one will click on a contact and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 under the old versions so the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 versions before android lollipop you 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 now press the menu of your 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.129
 phone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.469
 and there is an option that will be displayed 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 which is just any call towards 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 voicemail so you click 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.079
 it and it will just sent down 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.899
 as his name indicates the person 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 directly to your email 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 then under the pop bed there is the same 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 functionality by cons it must pass 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.950
 where you rely on edit 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.360
 the contact here and there under the menu there 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 to the option I just talked about 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.580
 exactly the same you can block 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.990
 all the calls and that's so who will 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.979
 sent directly to your email 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.979
 voice 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.500
 then know that there are Roma by 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.140
 example as on the stage on which 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.570
 I am sorry who is it is our genes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 you have the possibility in the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.210
 system settings to regain a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.710
 confidentiality feature 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.159
 privacy forgiveness so a list 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.070
 black 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.810
 and there you can add a number so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.520
 you can block incoming calls and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 incoming messages that some 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.290
 nobody so it's very practical and it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.329
 so lets totally block we did not 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.369
 not even in fact we have the opportunity to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 settle directly in there if we 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.180
 whether or not the notification that this 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.399
 no one tried to contact us 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.259
 will be very convenient and finally there is 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.290
 apps also available 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.360
 who can do that for you so the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.630
 better in my opinion it's cold blacklist 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.369
 that you see here 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 you can download the link itself 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.459
 found in the description so 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.760
 I just left you the message 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.130
 So know starting from android 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.870
 4.4 so that is to say kitkat and 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.349
 therefore later versions ie the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.720
 pop bed 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.730
 it is necessary to configure this 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.950
 application like the application mms sms 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.260
 by default to allow blocking them 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.420
 sms so after you activate if that you 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.370
 interested or not there I 'm going to put 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.470
 disabled and there you press more 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.700
 you can add someone from the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.349
 call log from contacts 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.530
 from the log messages 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.299
 manually also so that's 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 very simple you add number and 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.410
 then you programmed all that and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.510
 some nice little features 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.640
 and also a pro version I you 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.250
 eventually let buy it if you 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.019
 are really interested in 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.090
 advanced features of these 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.799
 apps and then avoid the ads and 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.900
 you just do not hesitate to finish 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.700
 with this little trick I propose you 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.110
 leave a little like it if you 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.720
 ideas or if you liked it all 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.430
 simply and share the video and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.110
 forget of course not to subscribe 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.320
 if it's not already done thanks to all 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:21.819
 and very quickly 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:21.819
