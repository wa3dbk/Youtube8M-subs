00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.970
The world closes in my heart.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.870
A faint landscape passes before my eyes,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.220
like a picture that doesn't resemble my memories.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.620
The past goes by and get lost in time,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.570
its colors slowly fading away

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.070
while telling a story that refuses to disappear.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.220
The world I see below the night sky

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.170
fades in the distance,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.520
trying to fix its problems by itself.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.920
Somehow sunrise still dazzles me.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.870
We're on the edge of a new beginning.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.720
Unknown colors are permeating and filling my heart...

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.120
A voice tells me that to take I must give something in return,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.420
will be me the one to judge over everyone else?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.920
A voice tells me that if I do harm I must pay a price,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.170
but, isn't a god the only with the power to create and destroy?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.770
Darkness asks me to destroy something to protect it

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.070
while it covers me with fear.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.470
So if you're about to scream, do it,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.170
but the world will still pay for that.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.170
Inside a shiny light in the sky

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.520
reality and nowhere mix with each other.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.920
If you're making an oath, make others do it too

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.770
so you combine the strenght of your will.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.320
Finally peace and hope

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.220
arrive to our world,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.070
even if the truth makes it different in this place...
