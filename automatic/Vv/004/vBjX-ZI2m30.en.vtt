because i want to show you that feature
of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.740> deck<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:39.870> these<00:02:40.050> decks<00:02:40.410> are<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.130> good

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
of the deck but these decks are so good

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.860 
of the deck but these decks are so good
that<00:02:42.560> i<00:02:43.560> was<00:02:43.890> able<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:45.060> kick<00:02:45.569> flip

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that i was able to actually kick flip

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650 
that i was able to actually kick flip
with<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:47.100> deck<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.120> way<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.510> is

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
with this deck the way that it is

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.150 
with this deck the way that it is
actually<00:02:48.930> both<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> decks<00:02:49.650> i<00:02:49.770> was<00:02:49.890> able<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
actually both of the decks i was able to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.300 
actually both of the decks i was able to
do<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.340> no<00:02:51.209> grip<00:02:51.450> tape<00:02:51.690> no<00:02:52.350> wheels<00:02:52.560> or<00:02:52.769> trucks<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
do it no grip tape no wheels or trucks a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.060 
do it no grip tape no wheels or trucks a
nice<00:02:54.030> clean<00:02:54.420> kickflip<00:02:54.900> part<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> reason

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
nice clean kickflip part of the reason

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.280 
nice clean kickflip part of the reason
is<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.550> they<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.660> higher<00:02:57.980> kicks<00:03:00.290> now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
is because they have higher kicks now

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
is because they have higher kicks now
the<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.730> he<00:03:02.820> sent<00:03:03.060> me<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the the one that he sent me with the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.770 
the the one that he sent me with the
cherry<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:05.130> believe<00:03:08.300> yes<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
cherry is the believe yes it has the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.390 
cherry is the believe yes it has the
higher<00:03:10.019> kicks<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.830> get<00:03:10.920> high<00:03:11.100> kicks

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
higher kicks so you can get high kicks

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.420 
higher kicks so you can get high kicks
like<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.030> also<00:03:15.209> got<00:03:16.430> medium

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
like that and it's also got medium

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.960 
like that and it's also got medium
concave<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.480> then<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.489> kicks<00:03:20.790> are

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
concave and then this one the kicks are

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.660 
concave and then this one the kicks are
a<00:03:21.030> little<00:03:21.269> lower<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.019> more<00:03:22.200> medium<00:03:22.680> now

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
a little lower so the more medium now

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.190 
a little lower so the more medium now
with<00:03:23.850> both<00:03:24.060> these<00:03:24.239> decks<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.750> nose<00:03:24.959> is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
with both these decks the nose is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.110 
with both these decks the nose is
steeper<00:03:25.560> than<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.709> tail<00:03:26.010> which<00:03:26.519> will<00:03:26.790> help<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
steeper than the tail which will help a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.020 
steeper than the tail which will help a
lot<00:03:27.269> with<00:03:27.329> your<00:03:27.660> shirts<00:03:27.930> believe<00:03:28.320> me<00:03:28.500> and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
lot with your shirts believe me and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.620 
lot with your shirts believe me and
these<00:03:30.030> are<00:03:30.090> only<00:03:31.010> 1995<00:03:32.010> for<00:03:33.000> each<00:03:33.120> deck<00:03:33.390> and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
these are only 1995 for each deck and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.240 
these are only 1995 for each deck and
they<00:03:33.930> are<00:03:35.630> solid<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.650> looks<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:38.100> me<00:03:38.220> like

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
they are solid now it looks to me like

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.430 
they are solid now it looks to me like
they're<00:03:38.549> about<00:03:38.760> five<00:03:39.090> plies<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:40.260> always

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
they're about five plies and I always

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.210 
they're about five plies and I always
try<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:40.829> but<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.730> never<00:03:42.090> shows<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.950> start

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
try this but it never shows and I start

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.319 
try this but it never shows and I start
about<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.670> can<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:44.970> see<00:03:45.299> the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
about that but you can really see the

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.069 
about that but you can really see the
nice<00:03:45.630> concave<00:03:47.209> there<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> case

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
nice concave there you go and the case

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.960 
nice concave there you go and the case
it's<00:03:49.260> got<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.829> nice<00:03:50.100> shape<00:03:50.430> compared<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
it's got a really nice shape compared to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.479 
it's got a really nice shape compared to
their<00:03:51.120> first<00:03:51.360> mold<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.160> really<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:53.340> these

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
their first mold I really like these

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.949 
their first mold I really like these
decks<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.970> lot<00:03:54.590> those<00:03:55.590> are<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.739> higher<00:03:55.950> kicks

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
decks a lot those are the higher kicks

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.140 
decks a lot those are the higher kicks
so<00:03:57.959> now<00:03:58.110> I'm<00:03:58.860> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> show<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.220> how<00:03:59.310> you

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
so now I'm going to show you how you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.180 
so now I'm going to show you how you
could<00:04:00.299> put<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.739> put<00:04:02.010> them<00:04:02.100> on

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.370 
could put these on you can I put them on
this<00:04:02.400> way<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.360> graphic<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.810> facing<00:04:04.170> down

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
this way so the graphic is facing down

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.210 
this way so the graphic is facing down
