00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
know how that works electro harpoons now

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.370 
know how that works electro harpoons now
deal<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.090> additional<00:00:36.180> fifty<00:00:36.930> percent<00:00:37.200> damage

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
deal an additional fifty percent damage

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.780 
deal an additional fifty percent damage
as<00:00:37.739> opposed<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.219> twenty<00:00:38.610> five<00:00:38.760> percent

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
as opposed to just twenty five percent

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
as opposed to just twenty five percent
as<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> old<00:00:39.450> value<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> scrap<00:00:41.129> she'll

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
as the old value and in a scrap she'll

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.760 
as the old value and in a scrap she'll
give<00:00:41.610> sixty<00:00:41.879> percent<00:00:41.969> increase<00:00:42.329> yield<00:00:42.770> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
give sixty percent increase yield and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.680 
give sixty percent increase yield and
movement<00:00:44.460> speed<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.320> propose<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> spirit

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
movement speed I propose to a spirit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.090 
movement speed I propose to a spirit
just<00:00:48.690> twenty<00:00:48.960> five<00:00:49.110> percent<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just twenty five percent which would it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
just twenty five percent which would it
used<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> danger<00:00:50.879> zone<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:52.440> yeah

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
used to be in the danger zone so um yeah

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.020 
used to be in the danger zone so um yeah
I<00:00:52.739> guess<00:00:52.980> technically<00:00:53.809> danger<00:00:54.809> zone<00:00:55.550> time<00:00:56.550> now

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
I guess technically danger zone time now

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.610 
I guess technically danger zone time now
actually<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:57.930> competition<00:00:58.500> as

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
actually has a bit more competition as

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.029 
actually has a bit more competition as
opposed<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:58.920> spamming<00:00:59.359> flamethrowers

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
opposed to just spamming flamethrowers

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.969 
opposed to just spamming flamethrowers
Jerian<00:01:02.989> because<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Jerian because basically you want to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
Jerian because basically you want to
mostly<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.659> danger<00:01:06.930> zone<00:01:07.080> time<00:01:07.290> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
mostly just use your danger zone time in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.640 
mostly just use your danger zone time in
flame<00:01:07.680> spitta<00:01:07.920> before<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
flame spitta before I don't know it can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
flame spitta before I don't know it can
be<00:01:10.680> worth<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.490> using<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.570> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
be worth you know using that time in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.760 
be worth you know using that time in
these<00:01:12.810> other<00:01:12.960> spells<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.650> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
these other spells now but it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.020 
these other spells now but it's
something<00:01:13.950> certainly<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.700> back<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
something certainly going back and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.960 
something certainly going back and
Elaine<00:01:15.330> makes<00:01:16.140> things<00:01:16.439> easier<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.729> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
Elaine makes things easier i know i can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.700 
Elaine makes things easier i know i can
only<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> laning<00:01:18.659> phase<00:01:18.840> basically<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> do

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
only the laning phase basically you do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340 
only the laning phase basically you do
is<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.009> charge<00:01:20.490> everything<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:21.350> get

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
is you just charge everything up get

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.249 
is you just charge everything up get
into<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:23.820> sort<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> yellow<00:01:24.509> danger<00:01:25.080> zone

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
into this sort of the yellow danger zone

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.320 
into this sort of the yellow danger zone
area<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.520> speed<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.090> back

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
area and then just speed your way back

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
area and then just speed your way back
in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> lane<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.740> shield<00:01:29.009> over<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.400> over

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
in the lane the shield over and over

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.590 
in the lane the shield over and over
again<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:29.729> basically<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.270> happens

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
again because basically what happens

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.910 
again because basically what happens
what<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:31.560> you're<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
what you can do is once you're in the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
what you can do is once you're in the
danger<00:01:32.070> zone<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.270> shield<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
danger zone with the shield is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.530 
danger zone with the shield is
maintained<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> shield<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.030> just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
maintained a shield like this and just

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.030 
maintained a shield like this and just
go<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> lane<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> 50-percent

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
go back in a lane with a 50-percent

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
go back in a lane with a 50-percent
movement<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.780> i<00:01:39.960> feel<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.470> being

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
movement off but i feel like being

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
movement off but i feel like being
critically<00:01:41.159> proactive<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.119> lazy

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
critically proactive and not lazy

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280 
critically proactive and not lazy
actually<00:01:43.619> pressing<00:01:43.829> buttons<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:45.390> um<00:01:45.689> yeah
