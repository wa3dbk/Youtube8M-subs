00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.833
Hello, everyone.
I am Merve Ã–zkaynak.

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:04.292
Welcome to my channel.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:07.875
On this video, I will talk about
a recipe for a lip peeling...

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.625
...that you can make easily at home
which is good for chaps.

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.875
First, let's start with
ingredients.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.083
First and most important
ingredient is sugar.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.500
I used brown sugar. But you
can use white sugar too.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.458
Olive oil, it'd better to use
extra-virgin olive oil.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:32.083
Honey and lastly, a small bowl
for mixing.

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:36.250
Including the main ingredients, if
you want your peeling to be...

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:40.125
...colourful and scented, you can
use the aromas...

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.000
...which are used while baking cakes
and food colouring.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.875
Let's start, then.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.542
We start with the first and most
important ingredient.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:52.375
Of course, sugar.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.625
We take one spoon of sugar
on our bowl.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:04.625
I used brown sugar, if you want
a colourful lip peeling...

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.042
...it'd better to use
white sugar.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.792
Second ingredient is olive oil.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.042
We don't want a too-oily
texture for this peeling.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.875
So I recommend adding the
oil slowly.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.000
Like this...

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.167
Less than a tea spoon
of olive oil.

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.625
Let's mix them first.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:38.708
Because the texture we want
is like a little moistured sand...

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.042
...and not too oily.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.750
If we don't like the texture,
and it becomes oily, we add sugar.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.000
And if it's too dry, we
can add more olive oil.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.167
Now we mix it slowly.

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.333
And now, we add honey.

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.667
Again, half a tea spoon.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.792
I think this would be enough.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:30.042
We need to mix them pretty good
so that the olive oil...

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.667
...and honey blend.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.583
You know, honey has a
moisturizing effect.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:45.042
Since I use this lip peeling
often, I could easily...

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.000
...estimate the proportions.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:52.250
But if you are doing this for the 
first time put a little olive oil...

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:56.000
...and honey because we don't want
to have a paste-like texture.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.042
Just like a little 
moisturized sand...

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.083
...you need to see 
pieces of sugar.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.625
You can start with small
amounts.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:09.500
I repeat, if you make it too oily,
you need to add sugar.

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:14.792
And if it's too dry, you can add
small amount of honey and olive oil.

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:21.042
But the texture that we want
is this fragmentary texture.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.667
Now, I start applying it.

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:29.583
While applying it, we take enough
peeling on our middle finger.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.833
And without pressing too hard,
we massage our lips.

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:36.042
The thing you need to watch
out for is to rasp.

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.167
Because our goal is to get
the dead tissue there.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:45.042
If your lips are dryer than normal
and about to bleed...

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:48.458
...I don't recommend this
peeling application.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.667
At this point, what you need to do
is to get a healing ointment...

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.583
...which are sold at
the pharmacies.

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:57.000
After applying the peeling...

00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:59.000
...it's important to moisturize
your lips.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:03.042
Don't forget to apply a lip
moisturizer that you like...

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:05.750
...right after the peeling.

00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:12.333
If you want to gift this home-made
peeling to your friends...

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:17.042
...you can use this kind of aromas
which are used on bakeries...

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:22.250
...or this food colouring.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.083
I will use this on
brown sugar.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:28.667
Of course, you can get a better
result with white sugar.

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:34.833
I think even one drop
would be enough.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.667
Now, let's start mixing them.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:53.125
Even in the brown sugar
we had a cherry colour.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:57.542
I believe it'd make a red or
pink tone on white sugar.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.375
You can also gift this scented
colourful lip peeling you made...

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:05.208
...with this cute bottles to your
loved ones and friends.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.083
