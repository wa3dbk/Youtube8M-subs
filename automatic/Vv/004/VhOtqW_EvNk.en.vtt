00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hello 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.450
 welcome back welcome back here we are with maria telling the wonders 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.939
 technology is tonight 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.109
 not just words he wants because we have the first example of alpette aquii studied 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.830
 physically we will see him shortly 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.150
 here it is we will see above all 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.990
 in this blog with applications that is what loses in it 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.910
 we have known it with a beautiful desirable object, but I give it to you 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.949
 what's inside 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.840
 for now let's return for a moment our journalist friends to see for a moment that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.479
 what's inside the effects because 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.719
 It is clear that this is a bit of a Trojan horse in the sense it was 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.720
 cast as an object of desire but within 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.600
 there will be thousands of magazines of music movie books 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.920
 so maybe this is the great idea 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.760
 heidi this product 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.940
 I ask the director to show us videos of some applications 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 umberto tu what do you expect to find us in the ita eng 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.920
 definitely thousands of apple store application 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 with a departure 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.950
 wait for the track 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.870
 that doesn't eat money anyway 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.560
 because I love you I love you I love traveling sea sea happy coals taken away 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.509
 I would like to return to the room 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.990
 at the Milan conference he is not a fan of the now and he is eating money 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.299
 that connects discharge &amp; lt in volley a2 this goes to this door that makes you 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.869
 access the cost 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.469
 and from there I continue to spend 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.349
 even if they are the two 99 99 tried to reach 2 300 or 400 euros of 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.039
 applications you don't put in Italian for now try what we are seeing 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.049
 this video tank is not very interesting because 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.340
 we see here what can be found also at the level of materials 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.310
 scientific 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.530
 gigi is an object of disclosure therefore this product absolutely 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
 let's say the application my mind will range from the avenue video games 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.979
 tables of the elements in this case I can see represented in +30 area 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.009
 see how certain facts are that the various chemical elements for which 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.659
 we are certainly a very educational part of the product 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.919
 baby octopus is a very personal product so it will reflect our very much 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.760
 in our interest so I liked it a lot 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.190
 going to look for books and also wanted to read newspapers 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.640
 because finally I will be able to post the online newspaper that I may be able to do before 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 do only with t 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.470
 full archibald janas i face after how much we say will change a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.120
 alas clearly underlined this year 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.800
 the problem of the cost of the application exists 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.410
 because these early days have already been problems because some products 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.760
 toads sold at a posted price changed as well as changed I thought precisely 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 red with luggage rack very well in this respect the power of attorney who 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.149
 to check 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.450
 all the products that are never stop a website anymore 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.310
 that is, this infusion umberto tuga works giving me to the courier of the evening which is a 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.619
 daily symbol also of Milan 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.810
 according to you this product 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.199
 a newspaper friend will become an enemy 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:19.149
 logo will become a friend from the point of view of the diffusion of the 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.219
 news information 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.729
 can only be sad very friendly 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:29.399

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.719
 hahaha anyway and we're all going to see the experiment disappointing time too 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.419
 unfortunately the examples we see of the united states are not so exciting 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.270
 I think that 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.899
 the pass on the leather to pull together 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:45.869
 such as 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:51.080

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.079

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.169

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.770
 moment to the hype is the protagonist of this episode of in the first coffee 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.870
