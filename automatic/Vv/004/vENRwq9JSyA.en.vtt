00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.410 

Oh<00:02:02.000> baby<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.300> my<00:02:03.660> art

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.850 

taking<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.540> favorite<00:02:11.930> brown<00:02:12.170> eyeliner<00:02:12.560> I'm

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
taking my favorite brown eyeliner I'm

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.770 
taking my favorite brown eyeliner I'm
going<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.489> lining<00:02:13.819> my<00:02:14.120> lower<00:02:14.420> lash<00:02:14.750> line

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
going to be lining my lower lash line

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 
going to be lining my lower lash line
about<00:02:15.290> halfway<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.129> also<00:02:16.280> completing<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
about halfway in and also completing the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.339 
about halfway in and also completing the
underside<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.750> wing<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.110> made

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
underside of the wing that I made

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.350 
underside of the wing that I made
earlier<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.950> like<00:02:19.519> using<00:02:19.730> Brown<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.239> this

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
earlier I like using Brown for this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.059 
earlier I like using Brown for this
because<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.840> not<00:02:20.930> only<00:02:21.260> less<00:02:21.470> harsh<00:02:21.739> but<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
because it's not only less harsh but you

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.250 
because it's not only less harsh but you
get<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.400> definition<00:02:23.060> without<00:02:23.510> closing<00:02:24.019> off

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
get the definition without closing off

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.740 
get the definition without closing off
your<00:02:24.409> eye<00:02:24.440> too<00:02:24.590> much<00:02:31.480> after<00:02:32.480> you've<00:02:32.599> applied

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
your eye too much after you've applied

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.360 
your eye too much after you've applied
your<00:02:33.079> mascara<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.680> could<00:02:33.829> of<00:02:33.920> course<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
your mascara you could of course just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.890 
your mascara you could of course just
leave<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.450> mentioned<00:02:35.510> I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
leave it like that but as I mentioned I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.839 
leave it like that but as I mentioned I
was<00:02:36.140> going<00:02:36.560> out<00:02:36.650> afterwards<00:02:37.159> so<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.370> did<00:02:37.610> want

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
was going out afterwards so I did want

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.940 
was going out afterwards so I did want

Ardell 120s and I've been loving them

I'm just going to take some Revlon lash

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:59.870 
I'm just going to take some Revlon lash
adhesive<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.780> go<00:02:45.440> ahead<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.799> place<00:02:46.040> those<00:02:46.280> on

this<00:03:00.720> part<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.110> optional<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.800> think<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
this part is optional but I do think it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
this part is optional but I do think it
really<00:03:02.340> helps<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> look<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> your<00:03:03.180> lashes<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
really helps the look of your lashes to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.780 
really helps the look of your lashes to
use<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.960> curler<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.440> blend<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> real<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.580> false

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
use a curler to blend the real and false

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.760 
use a curler to blend the real and false
lashes<00:03:06.030> together<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.230> ends<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.560> making

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
lashes together it just ends up making

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.530 
lashes together it just ends up making
them<00:03:07.980> look<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.190> little<00:03:08.220> more<00:03:08.430> natural<00:03:08.550> will

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
them look a little more natural will
