00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
really gonna like this though because in

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.590 
really gonna like this though because in
the<00:02:43.430> Marlins<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.060> was<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.270> lots<00:02:44.480> of

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
the Marlins there was like lots of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.979 
the Marlins there was like lots of
swearing<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.410> gruesomeness<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.570> think

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
swearing and gruesomeness but I think

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.600 
swearing and gruesomeness but I think
instead<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> more<00:02:48.620> contemporary<00:02:48.920> setting

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
instead of a more contemporary setting

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.360 
instead of a more contemporary setting
that'll<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.330> better<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> hopefully<00:02:51.590> he'll<00:02:52.100> do

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
that'll be better and hopefully he'll do

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.440 
that'll be better and hopefully he'll do
it<00:02:52.489> better<00:02:52.640> than<00:02:52.730> how<00:02:52.970> he<00:02:53.000> did<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
it better than how he did it in the
