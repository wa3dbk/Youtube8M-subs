00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
of dynamic so uh I don't think spec ops

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.389 
of dynamic so uh I don't think spec ops
is<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.289> be<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.530> big<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.890> zombies<00:01:38.219> ever

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
is going to be as big as zombies ever

is going to be as big as zombies ever
was<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.679> was<00:01:40.890> pretty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
was but what do I know it was pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.230 
was but what do I know it was pretty
cool<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.429> was<00:01:41.520> better<00:01:41.670> than<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> thought<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.179> was

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
cool it was better than I thought it was

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.029 
cool it was better than I thought it was

going to be on multiplayer let's talk

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.679 
going to be on multiplayer let's talk
about<00:01:44.189> my<00:01:44.429> impressions<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> high<00:01:45.240> level<00:01:45.270> on

about my impressions at a high level on
the<00:01:45.810> multiplayer<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.439> modern<00:01:46.679> warfare<00:01:46.829> 3<00:01:46.979> if

the multiplayer for modern warfare 3 if
there's<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.060> takeaway<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.469> what

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
there's one takeaway on that it's what

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.730 
there's one takeaway on that it's what
it's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.789> not<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.780> modern<00:01:52.560> warfare

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's not it is not just modern warfare

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.709 
it's not it is not just modern warfare
two<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> half<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.700> thought<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
two and a half I thought it was going to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.929 
two and a half I thought it was going to
be<00:01:54.840> modern<00:01:55.109> warfare<00:01:55.259> 2<00:01:55.679> with<00:01:56.310> maybe<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> couple

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
be modern warfare 2 with maybe a couple

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.730 
be modern warfare 2 with maybe a couple
different<00:01:57.240> killstreaks<00:01:57.539> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
different killstreaks you know and and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
different killstreaks you know and and
oh<00:01:58.950> by<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.159> way<00:01:59.280> fix<00:01:59.909> some<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.390> worst

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
oh by the way fix some of the worst

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
oh by the way fix some of the worst
things<00:02:01.049> about<00:02:01.289> modern<00:02:01.710> warfare<00:02:01.859> two<00:02:02.159> things

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
things about modern warfare two things

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.419 
things about modern warfare two things
like<00:02:02.729> commando<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.539> like<00:02:03.749> noob<00:02:03.960> tubes<00:02:04.429> if

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
like commando things like noob tubes if

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.709 
like commando things like noob tubes if
things<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.789> some<00:02:05.999> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.179> hell<00:02:06.299> painkiller

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
things like some of the hell painkiller

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499 
things like some of the hell painkiller
but<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.119> more<00:02:09.179> than<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
but it's actually a lot more than that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.450 
but it's actually a lot more than that
with<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> way<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.470> they've<00:02:10.649> redone<00:02:11.069> kill

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
with the way that they've redone kill

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.000 
with the way that they've redone kill
streaks<00:02:11.760> into<00:02:12.000> strike<00:02:12.630> packages<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
streaks into strike packages with the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.590 
streaks into strike packages with the
way<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.310> they've<00:02:14.460> redone<00:02:14.850> their<00:02:15.090> map<00:02:15.330> design

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
way that they've redone their map design

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.050 
way that they've redone their map design
to<00:02:16.260> make<00:02:16.410> things<00:02:16.590> more<00:02:16.860> gun<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.220> gun<00:02:17.460> but<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
to make things more gun on gun but the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.360 
to make things more gun on gun but the
way<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.420> they've<00:02:18.570> made<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.050> kill

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
way that they've made the kill

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.100 
way that they've made the kill
shrieks<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.760> little<00:02:20.030> less<00:02:20.239> deadly<00:02:20.599> than<00:02:20.930> they

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
shrieks a little less deadly than they

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.809 
shrieks a little less deadly than they
were<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.739> past<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.370> mix

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
were in the past it's it's like a mix

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.990 
were in the past it's it's like a mix
between<00:02:25.940> cod4<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.230> modern<00:02:27.590> warfare<00:02:27.769> 2<00:02:28.129> you

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
between cod4 and modern warfare 2 you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.390 
between cod4 and modern warfare 2 you
know<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:30.260> going<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.680> more<00:02:30.830> gun<00:02:31.069> on<00:02:31.190> gun

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400

it's<00:02:31.610> going<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:32.090> smaller<00:02:32.150> maps<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.989> going

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's going to be smaller maps it's going

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's going to be smaller maps it's going
to<00:02:33.349> be<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.799> lively<00:02:34.340> oh<00:02:34.459> that's<00:02:34.819> something

maps are having a hard time adjusting to

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.460 
maps are having a hard time adjusting to
the<00:02:51.709> pace<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.340> black<00:02:52.849> ops<00:02:53.060> being<00:02:53.930> kind<00:02:54.290> of

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
the pace of black ops being kind of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.910 
the pace of black ops being kind of
bigger<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.040> slower<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.709> feels

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
bigger and slower and just it feels

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.640 
bigger and slower and just it feels
almost<00:02:58.160> clunky<00:02:58.819> coming<00:02:59.329> from<00:02:59.629> the<00:03:00.379> you<00:03:00.530> know

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.300 
right you know now I have to somehow
make<00:03:14.659> it<00:03:14.720> back<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.200> where<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.379> want<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.769> be<00:03:15.890> again

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
make it back to where I want to be again

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.910 
make it back to where I want to be again
because<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.879> maps<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.359> array<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:18.109> gigantic

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
because the maps like array are gigantic

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.309 
because the maps like array are gigantic
so<00:03:19.430> um<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:20.299> here<00:03:20.510> I'm<00:03:20.629> playing<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:20.989> Nuketown

complaining about being man's but I
think<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.150> guys<00:03:23.180> will<00:03:23.510> get<00:03:23.810> what<00:03:24.260> I'm

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
think that you guys will get what I'm

think that you guys will get what I'm
saying<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:24.919> in<00:03:25.790> general<00:03:26.120> things<00:03:26.630> just

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
saying in that in general things just

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720 
saying in that in general things just
seem<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.290> move<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:27.680> bit<00:03:27.799> slower<00:03:28.220> in

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
seem to move a little bit slower in

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.750 
seem to move a little bit slower in
black<00:03:29.000> ops<00:03:29.239> than<00:03:29.750> they<00:03:29.930> ever<00:03:30.109> did<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.769> modern

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
black ops than they ever did in modern

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.750 
black ops than they ever did in modern
warfare<00:03:31.940> 3<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.769> there<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.459> so

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
warfare 3 and and there you have it so

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.690 
warfare 3 and and there you have it so
what<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.299> expect<00:03:35.510> in<00:03:35.959> modern<00:03:36.230> warfare<00:03:36.410> 3

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
what can you expect in modern warfare 3

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.990 
what can you expect in modern warfare 3
fast<00:03:37.700> paced<00:03:37.970> got<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.599> gun<00:03:38.810> lots<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.590> action

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
fast paced got on gun lots of action

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.970 
fast paced got on gun lots of action
small<00:03:41.000> maps<00:03:41.239> fewer<00:03:41.989> camping<00:03:42.410> spots<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.950> know

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
small maps fewer camping spots you know

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.349 
small maps fewer camping spots you know
because<00:03:43.310> there's<00:03:43.459> less<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.849> windows<00:03:44.209> above

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
because there's less like windows above

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.280 
because there's less like windows above
the<00:03:44.599> area<00:03:44.900> stuff<00:03:45.139> like<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.349> I<00:03:46.069> think<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.329> think

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
the area stuff like that I think I think

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.720 
the area stuff like that I think I think
it's<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.590> be<00:03:48.709> pretty<00:03:48.859> good<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.340> worry

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
it's going to be pretty good I worry

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.939 
it's going to be pretty good I worry
that<00:03:49.849> their<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.959> weapon<00:03:51.319> proficiencies<00:03:51.919> and

that their the weapon proficiencies and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the strike packages there so much there

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.189 
the strike packages there so much there
that<00:03:55.730> there's<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.359> be<00:03:56.389> something<00:03:56.840> about

that there's going to be something about

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.539 
that there's going to be something about

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
to be something like some combination

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.289 
to be something like some combination
that<00:04:00.530> stands<00:04:00.799> out<00:04:01.010> from<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.280> rest<00:04:01.400> but<00:04:02.239> we'll

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
that stands out from the rest but we'll

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.030 
that stands out from the rest but we'll
see<00:04:02.660> we'll<00:04:03.079> see<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.410> know<00:04:03.500> let's<00:04:03.680> not<00:04:03.829> hang

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
see we'll see you know let's not hang

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.830 
see we'll see you know let's not hang
the<00:04:04.190> game<00:04:04.340> until<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.669> until<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.480> commits<00:04:05.750> a

it<00:04:08.180> sound<00:04:08.510> at<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:08.810> because<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.440> environment

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
it sound at all because the environment

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
might just be the default thing that

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.850 
might just be the default thing that
everybody's<00:04:26.539> stuck<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.960> there<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.349> ran<00:04:27.560> quick

everybody's stuck on there I ran quick
draw<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.310> lot<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:29.090> we'll<00:04:29.240> see<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:30.020> UAVs<00:04:30.560> with

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
draw a lot but we'll see it UAVs with

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.779 
draw a lot but we'll see it UAVs with
the<00:04:30.919> way<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.159> they<00:04:31.250> earned<00:04:31.400> with<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.700> way

that you earn you a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.690 
that you earn you a
and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:34.080> can<00:04:34.260> even<00:04:35.130> though<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.430> die

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
and then you can even though you die

as<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.890> whether<00:04:47.040> or<00:04:47.190> not<00:04:47.220> advanced<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.760> maybe

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
as to whether or not advanced you maybe

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.460 
as to whether or not advanced you maybe
he's<00:04:48.060> pick<00:04:48.270> up<00:04:48.450> people<00:04:49.080> who<00:04:49.290> are<00:04:49.350> running

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
he's pick up people who are running

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.430 
he's pick up people who are running
assassin<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.250> think<00:04:51.000> they<00:04:51.210> do<00:04:51.270> someone<00:04:52.170> told<00:04:52.290> me

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
assassin I think they do someone told me

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.050 
assassin I think they do someone told me
recently<00:04:52.470> they<00:04:52.980> watched<00:04:53.190> on<00:04:53.370> taves<00:04:53.670> video

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
recently they watched on taves video

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.670 
recently they watched on taves video
where<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> advanced<00:04:54.570> UAV<00:04:54.750> came<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
where the advanced UAV came up and it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.430 
where the advanced UAV came up and it
showed<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.070> people<00:04:56.160> who<00:04:56.430> ran<00:04:56.580> assassin<00:04:57.180> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
showed the people who ran assassin and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.420 
showed the people who ran assassin and
then<00:04:58.440> there<00:04:58.590> are<00:04:58.650> other<00:04:58.800> people<00:04:59.070> people<00:04:59.190> who<00:04:59.400> i

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
then there are other people people who i

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.160 
then there are other people people who i
think<00:04:59.550> are<00:04:59.760> really<00:04:59.970> smart<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.630> commentators

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
think are really smart like commentators

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.540 
think are really smart like commentators
that<00:05:01.230> i<00:05:01.350> was<00:05:01.500> rooming<00:05:01.800> with<00:05:01.830> we're<00:05:02.310> saying

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
that i was rooming with we're saying

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.610 
that i was rooming with we're saying
that<00:05:02.640> you<00:05:02.760> advanced<00:05:03.120> UAV<00:05:03.480> does<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:04.230> pick<00:05:04.530> up

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
that you advanced UAV does not pick up

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320 
that you advanced UAV does not pick up
assassin<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:05.460> it's<00:05:05.640> in<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.880> air<00:05:06.000> i'm<00:05:06.210> not

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
assassin so it's in the air i'm not

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.980 
assassin so it's in the air i'm not
quite<00:05:06.570> sure<00:05:06.600> but<00:05:07.910> in<00:05:08.910> my<00:05:09.150> memory<00:05:09.510> it<00:05:09.660> did<00:05:09.840> pick

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
quite sure but in my memory it did pick

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.080 
quite sure but in my memory it did pick
up<00:05:10.110> assassin<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.830> i<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.460> wonder<00:05:11.670> if<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
up assassin and i have to wonder if the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.550 
up assassin and i have to wonder if the
reason<00:05:12.360> they<00:05:12.450> didn't<00:05:12.660> always<00:05:12.810> see<00:05:13.050> for<00:05:13.260> people

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
reason they didn't always see for people

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.500 
reason they didn't always see for people
was<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> respawn<00:05:14.160> delay<00:05:14.460> will<00:05:14.790> find<00:05:15.060> out<00:05:15.270> for

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
was a respawn delay will find out for

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.960 
was a respawn delay will find out for
sure<00:05:15.540> in<00:05:16.230> time<00:05:16.500> but<00:05:17.160> i<00:05:17.190> think<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.610> advanced

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
sure in time but i think you advanced

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.790 
sure in time but i think you advanced
UAV<00:05:18.180> does<00:05:18.390> pick<00:05:18.540> up<00:05:18.630> assassin<00:05:19.080> then<00:05:19.410> it's<00:05:19.560> 12

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
UAV does pick up assassin then it's 12

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.770 
UAV does pick up assassin then it's 12
points<00:05:20.220> 12<00:05:20.700> points<00:05:21.030> takes<00:05:21.240> about<00:05:21.480> as<00:05:21.660> much

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
points 12 points takes about as much

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.960 
points 12 points takes about as much
time<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.320> earn<00:05:22.470> as<00:05:22.800> eight<00:05:23.040> kills<00:05:23.340> does<00:05:23.580> because

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
time to earn as eight kills does because

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.700 
time to earn as eight kills does because
you<00:05:24.090> know<00:05:24.210> planting<00:05:24.630> bomb<00:05:24.780> capping<00:05:25.530> flag

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
you know planting bomb capping flag

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.880 
you know planting bomb capping flag
stuff<00:05:26.040> like<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:28.500> other<00:05:28.530> thing<00:05:28.710> is

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
stuff like that and the other thing is

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.700 
stuff like that and the other thing is
that<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:30.330> don't<00:05:30.480> have<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.990> stay<00:05:31.200> alive<00:05:31.470> for

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
that you don't have to stay alive for

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.740 
that you don't have to stay alive for
that<00:05:31.800> period<00:05:32.010> so<00:05:32.370> everyone<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:33.060> get<00:05:33.210> 12<00:05:33.420> kills

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
that period so everyone can get 12 kills

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.780 
that period so everyone can get 12 kills
in<00:05:33.930> a<00:05:34.020> game<00:05:34.230> which<00:05:34.710> means<00:05:34.950> everyone<00:05:35.400> can<00:05:35.640> learn

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
in a game which means everyone can learn

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.030 
in a game which means everyone can learn
advanced<00:05:36.240> UAVs<00:05:36.720> which<00:05:37.200> means<00:05:37.440> that<00:05:37.500> assassin

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
advanced UAVs which means that assassin

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.950 
advanced UAVs which means that assassin
is<00:05:38.160> not<00:05:38.310> as<00:05:38.460> valuable<00:05:38.610> as<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.600> know<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.810> might

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
is not as valuable as you know you might

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.930 
is not as valuable as you know you might
fear<00:05:40.350> that<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.710> is<00:05:40.890> because<00:05:41.520> all<00:05:41.640> you<00:05:41.730> need<00:05:41.850> is

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
fear that it is because all you need is

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.940 
fear that it is because all you need is
12<00:05:42.090> points<00:05:42.420> in<00:05:42.510> your<00:05:42.600> game<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:42.990> you'll<00:05:43.470> you'll

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
12 points in your game and you'll you'll

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.500 
12 points in your game and you'll you'll
get<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.280> advanced<00:05:44.610> UAV<00:05:44.790> and<00:05:45.030> that's<00:05:45.270> going<00:05:45.450> to

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
get the advanced UAV and that's going to

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.360 
get the advanced UAV and that's going to
show<00:05:45.660> us<00:05:45.780> ass<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.170> if<00:05:46.470> I'm<00:05:46.680> right<00:05:46.920> if<00:05:47.190> I'm

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
show us ass and if I'm right if I'm

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.700 
show us ass and if I'm right if I'm
wrong<00:05:47.580> then<00:05:47.640> then<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.510> we'll<00:05:48.630> see<00:05:48.840> but<00:05:49.350> those

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
wrong then then and we'll see but those

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.580 
wrong then then and we'll see but those
are<00:05:49.860> my<00:05:50.010> impressions<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:51.320> modern<00:05:52.320> warfare<00:05:52.440> 3

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
are my impressions of modern warfare 3

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.170 
are my impressions of modern warfare 3
so<00:05:52.890> far<00:05:52.920> and<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.280> high<00:05:53.370> level<00:05:53.670> it's<00:05:53.910> going<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.120> be

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
so far and a high level it's going to be

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.490 
so far and a high level it's going to be
fast<00:05:54.360> paced<00:05:54.600> going<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.840> have<00:05:54.930> less<00:05:55.080> camping

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
fast paced going to have less camping

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.500 
fast paced going to have less camping
going<00:05:55.980> to<00:05:56.040> be<00:05:56.130> more<00:05:56.310> gun<00:05:56.460> on<00:05:56.580> gun<00:05:56.850> going<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.390> be

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
going to be more gun on gun going to be

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.210 
going to be more gun on gun going to be
smaller<00:05:57.570> maps<00:05:58.110> I'm<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.680> little<00:05:58.710> worried<00:05:59.070> about

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
smaller maps I'm a little worried about

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.740 
smaller maps I'm a little worried about
assassin<00:05:59.700> but<00:05:59.820> we'll<00:05:59.970> see<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.360> think<00:06:00.630> it's

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
assassin but we'll see I think it's

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.000 
assassin but we'll see I think it's
going<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.900> be<00:06:00.960> picked<00:06:01.200> up<00:06:01.260> by<00:06:01.320> advanced<00:06:01.620> UAVs

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
going to be picked up by advanced UAVs

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.470 
going to be picked up by advanced UAVs
that<00:06:02.460> will<00:06:02.580> discourage<00:06:02.850> people<00:06:03.060> from<00:06:03.240> running

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
that will discourage people from running

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.600 
that will discourage people from running
it<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.590> there<00:06:04.770> it<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:04.920> now<00:06:05.340> we'll<00:06:05.490> get

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
it and and there it is now we'll get

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.340 
it and and there it is now we'll get
back<00:06:05.700> to<00:06:05.850> some<00:06:05.970> regular<00:06:06.330> videos<00:06:06.630> maybe<00:06:07.200> I've

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
back to some regular videos maybe I've

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.660 
back to some regular videos maybe I've
