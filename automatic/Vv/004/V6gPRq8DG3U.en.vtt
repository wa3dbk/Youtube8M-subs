interested here we owe our very first

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.560 
interested here we owe our very first
amplifier<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.150> read<00:02:51.330> about<00:02:51.360> that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
amplifier so you can read about that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.050 
amplifier so you can read about that
very<00:02:52.350> useful<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:53.370> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> find<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.910> whole

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
very useful we want to find a whole

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.229 
very useful we want to find a whole
bunch<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.390> those<00:02:54.570> if<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.880> fact<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
bunch of those if we can in fact I

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.020 
bunch of those if we can in fact I
should<00:02:58.220> pretty<00:02:59.220> much<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.400> able<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.700> find<00:02:59.880> them

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
should pretty much be able to find them

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.720 
should pretty much be able to find them
all<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:01.020> Allah<00:03:01.320> we<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.190> talk<00:03:02.459> about

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
what the asst stone does also on the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.800 
what the asst stone does also on the
pushback<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.000> glowing<00:03:06.300> when<00:03:06.600> there's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
pushback and the glowing when there's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.840 
pushback and the glowing when there's
invisible<00:03:07.290> stuff<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:08.520> can<00:03:08.640> see<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
invisible stuff to see you can see in

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.690 
invisible stuff to see you can see in
the<00:03:08.910> lower<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.330> there<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.720> actually<00:03:10.080> also

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
the lower right there it actually also

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.890 
the lower right there it actually also
powers<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.850> whatever<00:03:12.030> spell<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.810> all

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
powers up whatever spell we have it all

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930
