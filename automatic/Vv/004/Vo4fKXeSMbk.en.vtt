 that said let's start learning what 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.430
 which is the intro of the song that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.060
 it simply has four chords on 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.350
 First 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.350
 is this major 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:58.120
 we go together besides being the intro is 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.479
 the chorus also the second is the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.479
 less 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.679
 third is fa greater I want to buy 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.679
 and the fourth is sun greater a sweater 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.490
 those are the four chords that make the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.530
 intro that as I have told you already are the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.750
 same as they do the chorus and the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 rhythm that applies there and throughout the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.610
 song is this looks gives down to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 two up and down again stopping 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330
 i 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840
 how 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.150
 and we'll see how slowly touch 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.150
 we get it 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.210
 the least up to italy 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.210
 I want to change 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340
 in action 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.159
 mammy 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.119
 plus 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.119
 on the beach 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.010
 as great friends and we have what 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.990
 does in the introduction and the chorus 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.820
 that easy 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.340
 Now that we have what is the intro 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.990
 let's see the chords that make the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 stanza that would be when really 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.800
 start singing and they are very simple 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:37.070
 would start in C major and that the capons 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.550
 of the mafia now there was the biggest mafia and 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.700
 make down 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.860
 to rake fret sustained rhythm and are 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.730
 greater in exercise of mine mom do 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.190
 greater again 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.190
 and now it takes and fast sun 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.620
 now this morning again the same thing is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.620
 he really destroyed 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.780
 dear ones 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 a trojan rogue and would enter the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.239
 bridge so those are the chords of the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.700
 stanza and there applies the same rhythm that 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.019
 we've learned before so we're going to 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.909
 touch it slowly 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.909
 let's see if it comes out 3 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.370
 I am 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.580
 of the mafia 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.490
 and 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.770
 from my mom 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.260
 together 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.080
 according to minister 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.920
 shit for better 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.340
 for more 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.310
 km 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.670
 jimÃ©nez 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.950
 and we would arrive at the bridge and in the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.160
 those changes that need sustained 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.170
 sun are simply blows down 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.390
 well, we get to the bridge where 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.489
 we do the minor with the same rhythm 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.489
 before the youngest and they see me 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.000
 again the least men 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:28.040
 and my good lower 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.040
 throw my minor one more time 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.650
 and less now 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:39.060
 I do not have prepared 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.710
 I have already 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.260
 suitcases 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.020
 and we came to the chorus friends that 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.020
 We learned at the beginning moms 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.789
 find me a jersey 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 pass 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 will 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.949
 and I want to buy 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.210
 well friends that's all that the 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.430
 theme has no more return of sheet 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.700
 easy not good now that we already have 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.770
 all the parts I will teach you 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.690
 an additional guitar that is in the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.930
 Intro is worth doing a little 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.930
 just a few ornaments a series of this look 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.000
 and it's as easy as you can tell 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.460
 as it makes the melody we give an all 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.550
 until Italy how the choirs were made 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 and well then eject in fret 3 of the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.970
 fifth string remove fourth now another 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.510
 once fret three of the fifth and give 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:00.210
 third so it's easy that makes it three 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.240
 times 1 2 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.490
 3 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.880
 and now press the 2nd fret of the fourth 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.960
 rope raises door to the air and again 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.960
 the same 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.340
 i 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:26.389
 additionally another guitar on top of that 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.529
 is making this arrangement the same but 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.529
 up more acute 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.219
 and good to touch it because we click on 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:39.800
 fret 5 of the third string and we make 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:43.610
 a nut with indexes in fret 3 of 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.240
 first and second and we give here third 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.770
 rope second third first and that 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.770
 just like before we do it three times 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.580
 and now we press fret 5 is a string 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.460
 now 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.410
 we raise the three and others the same 5 and 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.410
 3 that easy 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.920
 put friends these are all parties 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.900
 of the subject and now what you have to do 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.120
 is to play it along with the video 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.220
 show that I leave the link here 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.680
 down and good to those who have arrived 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.930
 until the end I 'll give you a bonus and 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.300
 is that with the same chords that 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.880
 they play the chorus we can play this 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.750
 another song that I'm sure you know me 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.750
 it hurt 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.780
 It hurts
