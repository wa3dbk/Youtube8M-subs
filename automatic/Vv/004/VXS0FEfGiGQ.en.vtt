is but this unique geometric pattern
here<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> captures<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> energy<00:01:05.129> field<00:01:05.810> now

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
here it captures that energy field now

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
here it captures that energy field now
in<00:01:07.200> addition<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> captured<00:01:08.159> inner<00:01:08.280> energy

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in addition to the captured inner energy

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
in addition to the captured inner energy
field<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.390> needed<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> create<00:01:09.810> something<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
field I needed to create something that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
field I needed to create something that
would<00:01:10.470> show<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.100> energy<00:01:11.520> field<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
would show that energy field in a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
would show that energy field in a
practical<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.380> created<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.950> over

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
practical way so I created this over

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
practical way so I created this over
here<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> took<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> tip<00:01:15.290> 0ff<00:01:16.290> zero<00:01:16.650> four<00:01:16.950> zero

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here I took the tip 0ff zero four zero

print let me tell you this this little
thing<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.619> has<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> most<00:01:56.399> intricate<00:01:57.030> unique

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
thing here has the most intricate unique

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.319 
thing here has the most intricate unique
geometric<00:01:58.439> patterns<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> okay<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.030> we've

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
geometric patterns to it okay so we've

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.569 
geometric patterns to it okay so we've
got<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.659> experiment<00:02:01.619> ready<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
got the experiment ready to go here and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.280 
got the experiment ready to go here and
you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> tuned<00:02:03.540> receiver<00:02:03.990> antenna

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you can see the tuned receiver antenna

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.389 
you can see the tuned receiver antenna
and<00:02:04.380> everything<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.250> all

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and everything there so this is all

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.100 
and everything there so this is all
already<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
already go now what I'm going to do is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.839 
already go now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> bring<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:07.740> toward<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
I'm going to bring this down toward the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.179 
I'm going to bring this down toward the
energy<00:02:09.330> collector<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.280> I

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
energy collector and you can see as I

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.990 
energy collector and you can see as I
it<00:02:12.489> starts<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.209> come<00:02:13.359> on<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:14.079> dimly<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.879> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
it starts to come on just dimly and as I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.119 
it starts to come on just dimly and as I
approach<00:02:16.299> right<00:02:16.599> into<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> center<00:02:17.409> we<00:02:17.829> really

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
approach right into the center we really

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.339 
approach right into the center we really
reach<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.549> hot<00:02:19.120> spot<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.930> look<00:02:20.109> at<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
reach the hot spot and look at that

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.580 
reach the hot spot and look at that
folks<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.730> over<00:02:22.599> here<00:02:22.719> on<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> edges<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.379> dims

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
folks and over here on the edges it dims

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.099 
folks and over here on the edges it dims
out<00:02:23.829> pretty<00:02:24.370> quick<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.659> dies<00:02:25.840> out

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
out pretty quick and then just dies out

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.890 
out pretty quick and then just dies out
completely<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.920> leave<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.659> energy<00:02:28.659> field

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
completely as I leave the energy field

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.509 
completely as I leave the energy field
but<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.349> know<00:02:29.469> you<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.799> want<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.099> tip<00:02:30.370> of

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
but you know you you want the tip of

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.119 
but you know you you want the tip of
that<00:02:30.549> triangle<00:02:30.939> pointing<00:02:31.299> north<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.010> can

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
that triangle pointing north and you can

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.099 
that triangle pointing north and you can
see<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.700> play<00:02:34.000> there's<00:02:34.269> little<00:02:34.510> hot<00:02:34.750> zones

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
see as you play there's little hot zones

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.229 
see as you play there's little hot zones
that<00:02:35.469> that<00:02:36.280> come<00:02:36.459> on<00:02:36.579> brighter<00:02:36.879> and<00:02:37.120> other

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
that that come on brighter and other

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.940 
that that come on brighter and other
zones<00:02:37.540> are<00:02:37.719> a<00:02:37.750> little<00:02:37.870> smaller<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.439> by<00:02:38.680> far

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
zones are a little smaller but by far

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.129 
zones are a little smaller but by far
the<00:02:39.189> brightest<00:02:39.760> zone<00:02:39.969> is<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.389> there<00:02:40.689> in<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
the brightest zone is right there in the

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.990 
the brightest zone is right there in the
center<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.650> dip<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.099> down<00:02:42.340> into<00:02:42.790> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
center as you dip it down into the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.210 
center as you dip it down into the
center<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.230> thing<00:02:44.439> just<00:02:44.650> comes<00:02:44.919> on

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
center and that thing just comes on

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.199 
center and that thing just comes on
bright<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.919> such<00:02:47.919> an<00:02:48.099> interesting<00:02:48.430> effect

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
bright and such an interesting effect

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.490 
bright and such an interesting effect
you<00:02:49.299> know<00:02:49.419> the<00:02:49.510> capture<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:49.989> distant

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
you know the capture of distant

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.640 
you know the capture of distant
planetary<00:02:51.040> energy<00:02:51.250> like<00:02:51.639> that<00:02:51.909> and<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.319> again

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
planetary energy like that and and again

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.140 
planetary energy like that and and again
to<00:02:53.769> think<00:02:53.889> that<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.159> only<00:02:54.189> happens<00:02:54.879> on<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
to think that it only happens on the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.270 
to think that it only happens on the
first<00:02:55.419> day<00:02:55.659> of<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:55.810> fourth<00:02:56.019> month<00:02:56.109> but<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:57.219> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
first day of the fourth month but what a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.179 
first day of the fourth month but what a
fascinating<00:02:58.150> experiment<00:02:58.769> highly<00:02:59.769> recommend

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
fascinating experiment highly recommend

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.670 
fascinating experiment highly recommend
it<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:01.840> pretty<00:03:02.049> much<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:02.409> basic

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it so that's pretty much the basic

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.949 
it so that's pretty much the basic
effect<00:03:02.980> okay<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:03.939> I<00:03:04.269> love<00:03:04.510> making<00:03:04.840> things

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
effect okay so I love making things

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.020 
effect okay so I love making things
practical<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.829> one<00:03:05.950> practical<00:03:06.400> thing<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.879> can

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
practical and one practical thing I can

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.970 
practical and one practical thing I can
think<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.389> for<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:07.989> particular<00:03:08.620> effect

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
think of for this particular effect

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.369 
think of for this particular effect
would<00:03:09.189> be<00:03:09.310> cooking<00:03:09.730> an<00:03:10.000> egg<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.480> think<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:11.290> if

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
would be cooking an egg I think that if

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.649 
would be cooking an egg I think that if
you<00:03:11.500> put<00:03:11.530> an<00:03:11.769> egg<00:03:11.980> there<00:03:12.219> stand<00:03:12.609> it<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.819> end<00:03:12.879> and

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
you put an egg there stand it on end and

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.899 
you put an egg there stand it on end and
I<00:03:14.169> think<00:03:14.230> thanks<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:14.950> unique<00:03:15.219> planetary

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
I think thanks to the unique planetary

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.520 
I think thanks to the unique planetary
alignment<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.599> happens<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.139> first<00:03:17.290> hit

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
alignment that happens in the first hit

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.809 
alignment that happens in the first hit
the<00:03:17.560> fourth<00:03:17.859> months<00:03:18.370> if<00:03:18.489> you're<00:03:18.639> in<00:03:18.729> the

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
the fourth months if you're in the

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.640 
the fourth months if you're in the
northern<00:03:19.030> hemisphere<00:03:19.299> in<00:03:19.659> North<00:03:19.810> America<00:03:20.229> it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
northern hemisphere in North America it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.920 
northern hemisphere in North America it
may<00:03:20.799> be<00:03:20.859> possible<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.430> cook<00:03:21.669> an<00:03:21.819> egg<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.750> that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
may be possible to cook an egg and that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.149 
may be possible to cook an egg and that
just<00:03:23.109> seems<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.349> that<00:03:23.530> would<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.769> great

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
just seems like that would be a great

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.629 
just seems like that would be a great
way<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.940> celebrate<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:26.199> day<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.220> just

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
way to celebrate this day and I just

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.219 
way to celebrate this day and I just
thought<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.819> would<00:03:27.939> set<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.269> up<00:03:28.479> here<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.959> take

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
thought I would set it up here and take

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.839 
thought I would set it up here and take
some<00:03:29.409> temperature<00:03:29.829> readings<00:03:30.159> on<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.579> egg

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
some temperature readings on this egg

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.420 
some temperature readings on this egg
over<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.479> next<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.019> know<00:03:32.049> hour<00:03:32.439> and<00:03:33.159> see<00:03:33.340> if

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
over the next you know hour and see if

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.339 
over the next you know hour and see if

that egg oughta warm up and just you
know<00:03:40.209> begin<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.750> heat<00:03:41.019> up<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.439> maybe<00:03:41.590> even

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
know begin to heat up and maybe even

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.189 
know begin to heat up and maybe even
cook<00:03:41.949> an<00:03:42.069> egg<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.849> eat<00:03:43.150> an<00:03:43.299> egg<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:44.049> was
