00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
found that chronic itching actually
jumps<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> itch<00:01:45.000> neurons<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
jumps out of just the itch neurons and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
jumps out of just the itch neurons and
uses<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> whole<00:01:46.829> pain<00:01:47.189> system<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.759> takes<00:01:47.939> over

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
uses the whole pain system it takes over

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.420 
uses the whole pain system it takes over
pain<00:01:48.509> neurons<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> uses<00:01:49.829> them<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
pain neurons and uses them to make the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
pain neurons and uses them to make the
itching<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:51.090> intense<00:01:51.689> they're<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.259> quite

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
itching more intense they're not quite

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
itching more intense they're not quite
sure<00:01:52.470> why<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.950> happens<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:53.640> found<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
sure why it happens but they found that

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
sure why it happens but they found that
it's<00:01:54.090> connected<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.659> specific<00:01:55.229> protein

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's connected to a specific protein

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.340 
it's connected to a specific protein
called<00:01:55.890> b-raf<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.479> by<00:01:57.630> inhibiting<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
called b-raf and that by inhibiting it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
called b-raf and that by inhibiting it
they<00:01:58.740> could<00:01:58.920> potentially<00:01:59.520> create<00:01:59.700> new

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
they could potentially create new

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730 
they could potentially create new
medications<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.140> people<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.530> chronic

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
medications for people with chronic

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
medications for people with chronic
itching<00:02:02.570> now<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:03.719> itching<00:02:03.990> everywhere<00:02:04.439> by

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
itching now I'm itching everywhere by

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.679 
itching now I'm itching everywhere by
the<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.100> you've<00:02:05.250> ever<00:02:05.340> wondered<00:02:05.640> why<00:02:06.090> just

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the way if you've ever wondered why just

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.059 
the way if you've ever wondered why just
thinking<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.140> itching<00:02:07.590> makes<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> itchy

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
thinking about itching makes you itchy

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.460 
thinking about itching makes you itchy
well<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.420> scientists<00:02:10.020> there<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> couple

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
well so scientists there are a couple

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
well so scientists there are a couple
theories<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> threshold<00:02:12.599> for

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
theories one is that the threshold for

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.420 
theories one is that the threshold for
itchiness<00:02:13.140> is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
itchiness is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.640 
itchiness is
lowered<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.510> by<00:02:14.659> thinking<00:02:14.719> about<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.560> like

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
lowered just by thinking about it like

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.649 
lowered just by thinking about it like
you're<00:02:15.769> priming<00:02:16.250> your<00:02:16.579> itch<00:02:16.819> nerves<00:02:17.329> for

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
you're priming your itch nerves for

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.899 
you're priming your itch nerves for
activation<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.950> second<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.609> it's<00:02:19.790> a

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
activation and the second is that it's a

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.940 
activation and the second is that it's a
sympathetic<00:02:20.480> contagious<00:02:21.170> response<00:02:21.650> like

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
sympathetic contagious response like

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.670 
sympathetic contagious response like
when<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.549> on<00:02:22.819> after<00:02:23.209> someone<00:02:23.540> else<00:02:23.719> yawns<00:02:23.989> not

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
when we on after someone else yawns not

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.470 
when we on after someone else yawns not
that<00:02:24.920> knowing<00:02:25.280> either<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.640> those<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.239> going<00:02:26.420> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
that knowing either of those is going to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.339 
that knowing either of those is going to
make<00:02:26.659> it<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:26.989> away

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
make it go away

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.699 
make it go away
and<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.159> am<00:02:28.280> super<00:02:28.780> susceptible<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.989> contagious

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
and I am super susceptible to contagious

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.709 
and I am super susceptible to contagious
