00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.300
ISS 'Firestation' to Explore the Tops of Thunderstorms - 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.170
presented by Science@NASA

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.480
We all know what comes out of the bottom of thunderclouds: 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.210
bolts of lightning. 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.740
Jagged columns of light plunge Earthward, 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.690
heating the air to 50,000 degrees F, 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.690
about five times hotter than the surface of the sun. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.010
Claps of thunder announce this process somewhere on Earth 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.760
as often as 50 times a second.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.520
Have you ever wondered, though,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.200
what comes out of the top?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.460
In recent decades 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.030
researchers have discovered some strange things happening in the cloud tops. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.980
High above ordinary lightning, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
exotic light flashes known as red sprites, blue elves, 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.620
and blue jets shoot toward the heavens, 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.410
cold cousins to the fiery bolts below.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.120
In some places jets of antimatter fly upwards, 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.270
triggering the detectors on NASA's orbiting high-energy observatories. 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.950
And as often as 500 times a day, 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
Earth briefly mimics a supernova, 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.260
producing a powerful blast of gamma-rays 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.740
known as Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes or TGFs.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.540
No one knows exactly how these phenomena are related 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.080
either to each other or to the lightning down below.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.050
A new experiment called 'Firestation' 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.160
onboard the space station aims to find out. 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.620
Firestation is a package of sensors 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.450
designed to explore the links between TGFs, 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.380
ordinary lightning, and sprites.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.620
'The space station's orbit 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.200
will carry Firestation directly above thousands of active thunderstorms 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.860
during the one-year lifetime of the experiment,' 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.480
says principal investigator Doug Rowland 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.310
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.500
'The ISS is perfect for this kind of research.'

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.670
Unlike previous experiments in upper atmospheric lightning, 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.430
Firestation has the unique ability to observe thunderstorms 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.160
at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
It can record the radio static from lightning, 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.180
measure its optical glow 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.860
(including the red and blue light of sprites, elves, and jets), 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.030
and detect the gamma-rays and electrons associated with TGFs 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.860
and antimatter events.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.170
Rowland expects Firestation to observe up to 50 lightning strokes per day, 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.100
at least one TGF every few hours, 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.680
and a large TGF every couple of days. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.190
Such a firehose of multi-wavelength data 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.290
will allow researchers to sort out cause-and-effect connections 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.970
impossible to see in previous studies.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.500
'There are several different types of lightning,' Rowland says. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.600
'At the moment, 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.890
we don't even know which type produces a gamma-ray flash.' 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.200
Firestation could solve that decades-old mystery 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.670
in its first few weeks of operation.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.370
The thing that intrigues Rowland most about TGFs 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.200
is their surprising energetics.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.840
'Gamma-rays are thought to come from the most violent events 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.080
in the cosmos like stars colliding or exploding,' he points out. 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.430
'What a surprise 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.710
to find them shooting out of the cold upper atmosphere 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.460
of our own planet.'

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.620
Something up there is accelerating low-energy particles of air 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.590
to nearly the speed of light, 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.500
producing gamma-radiation and, sometimes, 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.460
a cascade of antimatter. 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.030
Rowland wants to find out what that strange, 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.150
unknown 'something' is. 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.440
Firestation is poised to crack the mystery.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.240
The experiment was delivered to the space station on August 3, 2013, 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.480
by the Japanese robotic cargo vessel 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.280
'Kounotori-4.' 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.620
It has since been installed on the station's exterior 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.500
by the station's robotic arm. 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.700
All of the sensors were checked out at the end of August 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.890
and full-time science operations are slated to begin 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.990
in early September 2013.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.420
For results from the cloud tops, 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.013
