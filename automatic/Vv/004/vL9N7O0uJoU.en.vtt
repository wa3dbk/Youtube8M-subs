the<00:00:00.930> idea<00:00:01.260> for<00:00:01.500> our<00:00:01.589> project<00:00:02.040> was<00:00:02.190> inspired

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
the idea for our project was inspired

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.910 
the idea for our project was inspired
from<00:00:02.730> immers<00:00:03.240> mom<00:00:03.510> was<00:00:03.720> gardening<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.589> found

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
from immers mom was gardening and found

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.610 
from immers mom was gardening and found
nodules<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.490> roots<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:06.089> people's<00:00:06.589> unsure<00:00:07.589> of

bacteria lived in the nodules we found

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.220 
bacteria lived in the nodules we found
out<00:00:14.219> about<00:00:14.490> nitrogen<00:00:14.730> fixing<00:00:15.360> bacteria<00:00:15.420> and

out about nitrogen fixing bacteria and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
out about nitrogen fixing bacteria and
we<00:00:16.410> were<00:00:16.470> inspired<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.039> experiment<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
we were inspired to experiment with this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.490 
we were inspired to experiment with this
bacteria<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.750> try<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.080> speed<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.350> the
