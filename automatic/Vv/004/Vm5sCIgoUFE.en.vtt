00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.839 
the mirror I mean like how it turned out
it<00:04:57.099> blends<00:04:57.729> really<00:04:58.120> well<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.979> purple<00:05:00.639> and

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
it blends really well the purple and

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.230 
it blends really well the purple and
blue<00:05:01.229> actually<00:05:02.229> complements<00:05:03.099> the<00:05:03.400> neutral

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
blue actually complements the neutral

blue actually complements the neutral
shades<00:05:04.599> and<00:05:04.930> that<00:05:05.139> was<00:05:05.319> quite<00:05:05.530> surprising<00:05:05.949> to

this 4 out of 5 stars the eyeliner this
is<00:05:22.680> probably<00:05:23.070> in<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> product<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.120> like

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360

the<00:05:24.389> most<00:05:24.510> out<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.290> four<00:05:25.530> items<00:05:25.800> that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the most out of the four items that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.909 
the most out of the four items that
attracted<00:05:26.790> it<00:05:26.940> just<00:05:27.540> basically<00:05:27.840> because<00:05:28.620> it

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
attracted it just basically because it

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.760 
attracted it just basically because it

disappointment is a chilly the mascara

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.879 
disappointment is a chilly the mascara
because<00:05:41.009> it<00:05:41.940> kind<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.449> didn't<00:05:43.229> do<00:05:43.530> what<00:05:43.860> I

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
because it kind of didn't do what I

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.159 
because it kind of didn't do what I
thought<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.490> would<00:05:44.669> do<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:45.180> me<00:05:45.300> as<00:05:45.690> long<00:05:45.930> as<00:05:46.139> a

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
thought you would do to me as long as a

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.350 
thought you would do to me as long as a
mascara<00:05:46.650> doesn't<00:05:46.979> hold<00:05:47.400> up<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.759> curl<00:05:48.000> it's

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
mascara doesn't hold up the curl it's

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.820 
mascara doesn't hold up the curl it's
kind<00:05:48.569> of<00:05:48.690> useless<00:05:48.960> unless<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.740> have

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
kind of useless unless you have

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.219 
kind of useless unless you have
naturally<00:05:50.370> curly<00:05:50.610> lashes<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.479> would<00:05:51.930> say<00:05:52.050> like

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
naturally curly lashes I would say like

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.990 
naturally curly lashes I would say like
go<00:05:52.470> ahead<00:05:52.740> with<00:05:52.919> this<00:05:53.129> because<00:05:53.520> in<00:05:53.699> essence

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
go ahead with this because in essence

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.119 
go ahead with this because in essence
much<00:05:54.240> it's<00:05:54.720> a<00:05:54.870> good<00:05:55.050> thing<00:05:55.229> lengthening

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
much it's a good thing lengthening

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.470 
much it's a good thing lengthening
curling<00:05:56.960> volumizing<00:05:57.960> this<00:05:58.349> one<00:05:58.620> doesn't<00:05:59.129> do

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
curling volumizing this one doesn't do

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.530 
curling volumizing this one doesn't do
and<00:06:00.110> last<00:06:00.470> but<00:06:00.620> not<00:06:00.950> least<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.520> concealer<00:06:02.300> i

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
and last but not least the concealer i

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.900 
and last but not least the concealer i
would<00:06:03.050> hope<00:06:03.260> there<00:06:03.530> will<00:06:03.650> be<00:06:03.830> in<00:06:04.070> my<00:06:04.430> shape

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
would hope there will be in my shape

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.120 
would hope there will be in my shape
maybe<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.600> will<00:06:05.780> make<00:06:05.840> it<00:06:06.170> work<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:06.650> the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
maybe that will make it work but the

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.240 
maybe that will make it work but the
coverage<00:06:07.580> isn't<00:06:07.880> quick<00:06:08.450> enough<00:06:09.250> oxidizers

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
coverage isn't quick enough oxidizers

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.000 
coverage isn't quick enough oxidizers
I'm<00:06:11.150> saying<00:06:11.540> that<00:06:11.750> it's<00:06:11.930> not<00:06:12.170> good<00:06:12.470> maybe<00:06:12.740> it's

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
I'm saying that it's not good maybe it's

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.680 
I'm saying that it's not good maybe it's
just<00:06:13.100> not<00:06:13.370> suitable<00:06:13.670> for<00:06:13.850> me<00:06:14.150> but<00:06:14.420> I<00:06:14.480> still

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
just not suitable for me but I still

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.740 
just not suitable for me but I still
think<00:06:14.960> it's<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.230> very<00:06:15.410> good<00:06:15.740> product<00:06:16.430> but<00:06:16.760> not

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
think it's a very good product but not

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.350 
think it's a very good product but not
