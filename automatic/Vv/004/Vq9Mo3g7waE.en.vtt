00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.099
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.610
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.890
 Solmecke 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 and I am clean pick nationwide 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 active defense lawyer of the firm 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 poland and master and in ours 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.849
 today's common consequence of taut 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 block and as before - tv is about 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.730
 the crack of sim locks is so that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 I bought this mobile phone and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 this is now a vodafone contract 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.460
 coupled and now you could on the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 idea come when you change the provider 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.129
 wants to crack that there is so 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.379
 called jailbreaks for and then 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 telekom contract to get though the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 device was cheaper 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.760
 because it was sponsored by 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 vodafone and so had that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.500
 court in göppingen one apart 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 to set already in 2011 because they said 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.859
 that is illegal when i simlock 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 Crackers so now I have one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.380
 Press release read at the beginning of 2013 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.700
 Again it was about the district court of Göttingen 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
 and there say the media 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 Well, they have changed their opinion 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 Judge now is the crack of jay 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.049
 Mobile phones and the use of jailbreaks 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.759
 no longer illegal as it is now 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 the legal situation you know more rainer 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 well so first of all vulnerable 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.790
 Gottingen is only one of thousands 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 of the diet and not necessarily 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.049
 groundbreaking if it's a decision 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.700
 but there is also in the press that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.720
 one or another christian wrong 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 been reproduced 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.290
 as far as I know it is so 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.700
 that this decision of january 2013 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 has led to a dealer of the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 has bought commercially embossed cell phones 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 or has characterized itself 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.970
 has resold to end users and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.409
 has not revealed to them 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.979
 that they are cracked phones 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.140
 These 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.729
 The man is too scared for that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 a one-year imprisonment 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.200
 To be sentenced 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.580
 but another little offense added 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.140
 on the other side that has 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.299
 district court in this connection 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 just not concerned with the question 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.090
 whether the jailbreaken itself is a crime 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.870
 but has this aspect of 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 thing excreted under paragraf 154 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.500
 set means that one said the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.940
 Scam weighs so hard that we are with us 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.230
 do not pay special attention to the other 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.180
 what could that possibly be for one 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.730
 crime is not the jailbreak mine 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.420
 apparently moment that still as 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.989
 yes, that can be a crime 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 forgery of technical records 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.850
 that is under penalty in § 269 of the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.610
 Criminal Code 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
 and there is this older one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.090
 jurisdiction of godingen the after 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.000
 whatever I know anyway in the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.830
 literature and in justice largely 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.480
 is shared and that basically says 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.239
 it is forbidden 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.860
 here the corresponding lock too 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.900
 overcome by software 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.380
 manipulated yes because you have one 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.420
 see 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.130
 the one who buys a mobile phone and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 the one who populates the software 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.239
 Handy buys does not buy the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.610
 Software becomes property only 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.920
 rights to use the software but he 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.269
 This software may not be easy 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 change arbitrarily 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.709
 Of course, another question is what 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.660
 threatens the one prepared for the mobile phone 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.120
 buy now it is so that you just 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.459
 on simbay again and again sim lock free 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.810
 buy phones can looks like this 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.060
 that I either in the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.959
 product description has the phone is 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.640
 free in the lock or the mobile phone is 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.630
 gejailbreakt that sounds like already 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.359
 a little different 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.730
 Maybe they are also criminal offenses 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.220
 So the purchase of sim lock free 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.410
 jailbroken phones how is that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.390
 legal situation and what does it look like when I am 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.090
 did not know that before that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.269
 we have been coined 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.709
 since in a legal gray area so far 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.660
 is there as far as I do not know one 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.670
 no one sacrifice anyway 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.940
 often publishes it against the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.890
 buyer of an embossed cell phone but we 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.579
 have already the judgment of the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.300
 Mettingen mentions what 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.490
 here 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.480
 the jailbreaken itself as a crime 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.820
 within the meaning of section 269 stgb 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.100
 and that regulation in turn says that 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.830
 that not only the changing of data 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.350
 but also the use of data 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.959
 that would be a crime if 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 it is assumed that godingen on the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.240
 correct line is cause that 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 the one who knowingly made a game 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 project buys the phone and then in 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.380
 user takes offense whether that makes 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.960
 then actually leading to it soon 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.400
 the proceedings are instituted against 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.090
 the acquirers of cell phones you have to 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.150
 wait 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.610
 so far, without exception, commercial 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.320
 dealer complains but as I said there is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.870
 some in the river ok then you can 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.550
 in summary, no matter if I say so 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.590
 I knew that the phone I bought 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.650
 I was jailbreaking or not 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.630
 knew at the moment at the moment where I 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.420
 notice that this has been cracked 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.190
 I'm not allowed to use them anymore 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.600
 We legally see the matter of course 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.320
 a little different if I do that 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.790
 did not know 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.830
 then I have one 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.720
 warranty claim against the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.100
 seller and can the device 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.320
 send back and then get as well 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.750
 my full money back at christian 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.550
 must of course see that actual 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.200
 In any case, criminal law risk 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.880
 be vanishingly small 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.440
 at least in the moment how is that then 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.980
 developed in the future that will stop you 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.120
 wait 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.520
 that's true, I'm not the only one 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.280
 Case where someone knows about the purchase 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.020
 a jailbreaker device somehow 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.810
 so that would have been cracked 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.419
 actually still in the balance 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.810
 but if we already crack at the topic 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.450
 are 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.060
 then I can already go to that 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.960
 next topic of our common 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.350
 to point out video blogs because that's what it's about 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.050
 to cracking wlans or around that 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.020
 dial into open wlans and like that 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.360
 whole civil law and criminal 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.430
 to judge that is the description we give you 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.760
 again in this common 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.270
 Video project of tight block and wbs 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.430
 law.de v 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.940
 thanks for watching and happy to see you 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.940
 next time
