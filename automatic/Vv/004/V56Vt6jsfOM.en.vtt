alright<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.350> now<00:00:01.589> what<00:00:01.949> I've<00:00:02.070> done<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.429> I've

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
alright so now what I've done is I've

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.510 
alright so now what I've done is I've
cut<00:00:02.820> two<00:00:03.120> more<00:00:03.330> pieces<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.870> wire<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.290> length

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
cut two more pieces of wire to length

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.540 
cut two more pieces of wire to length
we're<00:00:05.520> going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.000> solder<00:00:07.189> you<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:08.280> same

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we're going to now solder you know same

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.720 
we're going to now solder you know same

hook<00:00:12.599> 1<00:00:12.960> into<00:00:13.410> 1<00:00:14.250> terminal<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.910> into<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
hook 1 into 1 terminal one into the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.180 
hook 1 into 1 terminal one into the
other<00:00:15.299> solder<00:00:16.109> them<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> terminals<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
other solder them to the terminals and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.970 
other solder them to the terminals and
then<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:18.240> there<00:00:18.660> well<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
then from there well one of them is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650 
then from there well one of them is
going<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> those<00:00:21.090> two<00:00:21.359> points

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
going to go to one of those two points

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.120 
going to go to one of those two points
on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> circuit<00:00:22.410> board<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> other<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
on the circuit board and the other is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
on the circuit board and the other is
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> other<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.390> those<00:00:24.539> two

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
going to go to the other of those two

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.089 
going to go to the other of those two
points<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.260> then<00:00:25.320> we'll<00:00:25.439> solder<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:25.859> there

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
points and then we'll solder them there

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.160 
points and then we'll solder them there
and<00:00:26.310> then<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.000> we're<00:00:27.119> done<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.480> we'll

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and then when we're done with that we'll

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.259 
and then when we're done with that we'll
close<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.340> thats<00:00:29.519> which<00:00:29.789> does

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
close it up and see if thats which does

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
close it up and see if thats which does
what<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.510> want<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
what we want it to so I'm just going to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
what we want it to so I'm just going to
kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.210> started<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:34.170> ahead

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
kind of get started with that go ahead

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
kind of get started with that go ahead
and<00:00:34.559> strip<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> tips<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.850> wires<00:00:36.149> again

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and strip the tips of my wires again

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
and strip the tips of my wires again
here<00:00:36.840> again<00:00:37.489> just<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> need<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
here again just all you need it's just a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
here again just all you need it's just a
little<00:00:39.840> tiny<00:00:40.140> bit<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> exposed<00:00:40.950> metal<00:00:41.190> there

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
little tiny bit of exposed metal there

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
little tiny bit of exposed metal there
there<00:00:42.180> i<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:42.960> eighth<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> an

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
there i just have about an eighth of an

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.850 
there i just have about an eighth of an
inch<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.920> plenty<00:00:45.230> maybe<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.440> bit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
inch i will be plenty maybe a little bit

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
inch i will be plenty maybe a little bit
more<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.489> side<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
more for the side that we're going to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
more for the side that we're going to
hook<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> terminal<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> switch

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
hook into that terminal of the switch

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
hook into that terminal of the switch
itself<00:00:50.460> ok<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> our<00:00:52.110> wires

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
itself ok so there's one of our wires

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
itself ok so there's one of our wires
let's<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.309> other<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.670> going

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
let's get kind of this other one going

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.709 
let's get kind of this other one going
here<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.370> there's<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:57.059> use<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.270> side

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
here and there's one will use that side

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.939 
here and there's one will use that side
because<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.320> longer<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
because it's a little longer for the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.299 
because it's a little longer for the
switch<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.890> one

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
switch and then we'll do a little one

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.960 
switch and then we'll do a little one
there<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:03.260> all<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.860> first<00:01:05.610> step

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
there good all right so first step

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
there good all right so first step
remember<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> tin<00:01:08.600> little<00:01:09.600> wire

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
remember we're going to tin little wire

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.420 
remember we're going to tin little wire
so<00:01:10.650> we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> clean<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.610> tip<00:01:11.820> here

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
so we're going to clean our tip here

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
so we're going to clean our tip here
going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> wire<00:01:15.420> hot<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.590> kind

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to get the wire hot I'm just kind

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.899 
going to get the wire hot I'm just kind
of<00:01:16.770> put<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> near<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> solder<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> see

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of put it near the solder here you see

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
of put it near the solder here you see
you've<00:01:18.000> got<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.180> solder<00:01:18.450> coil<00:01:18.810> coming<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.380> here

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you've got my solder coil coming up here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
you've got my solder coil coming up here
then<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> wire<00:01:20.790> hot<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.960> kind

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
then you get the wire hot and just kind

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
then you get the wire hot and just kind
of<00:01:22.229> let<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.119> solder<00:01:24.119> whoops<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.810> sort<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
of let the solder whoops just sort of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530 
of let the solder whoops just sort of
let<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> solder<00:01:25.710> flow<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
let the solder flow kind of right on to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
let the solder flow kind of right on to
it<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> takes<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it and there it is that's all it takes I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
it and there it is that's all it takes I
mean<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> happens<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.790> fast<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> tip

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
mean it happens so fast so now the tip

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
mean it happens so fast so now the tip
of<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.530> wire<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.799> tinned<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> since<00:01:33.540> we're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
of this wire is tinned and since we're

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.940 
of this wire is tinned and since we're
here<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:33.930> might<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> other

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
here we might as well just do the other

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
here we might as well just do the other
side<00:01:35.299> hope<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> happens<00:01:37.409> almost

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
side hope there it is happens almost

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
side hope there it is happens almost
instantly<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:42.150> we

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
instantly so going to make just like we

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
instantly so going to make just like we
did<00:01:42.390> before<00:01:42.570> we're<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
did before we're going to make kind of a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.679 
did before we're going to make kind of a
little<00:01:45.210> hook<00:01:45.479> shape<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.600> put<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
little hook shape here and put the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
little hook shape here and put the
little<00:01:48.869> circuit<00:01:49.140> board<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.250> we're<00:01:50.369> going

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
little circuit board up and we're going

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.510 
little circuit board up and we're going
to<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.399> know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to put it in one of these two you know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
to put it in one of these two you know
well<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:54.780> when

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
well one thing to think about when

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.190 
well one thing to think about when
you're<00:01:55.259> doing<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're doing this kind of thing is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
you're doing this kind of thing is
sometimes<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.149> piece<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
sometimes if you make the piece of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.709 
sometimes if you make the piece of
exposed<00:02:00.990> wire<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.680> long<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:03.270> might<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
exposed wire too long it might even be

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.170 
exposed wire too long it might even be
long<00:02:03.990> enough<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.469> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> bridge<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
long enough to kind of bridge one of the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.789 
long enough to kind of bridge one of the
context<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> switch<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> touch<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
context in the switch and touch the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
context in the switch and touch the
other<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.399> which<00:02:08.819> case<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.420> which

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
other one in which case that's which

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.729 
other one in which case that's which
isn't<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.140> its<00:02:10.289> thing<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
isn't going to do its thing so you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.770 
isn't going to do its thing so you
