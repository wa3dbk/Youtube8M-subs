just<00:01:18.960> leaks<00:01:19.289> over<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.310> evidenced<00:01:21.119> by<00:01:21.270> all

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
just leaks over time as evidenced by all

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.730 
just leaks over time as evidenced by all
the<00:01:22.429> residue<00:01:23.429> here<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.499> today<00:01:25.499> we're<00:01:25.619> gonna

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the residue here but today we're gonna

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.529 
the residue here but today we're gonna
take<00:01:25.920> care<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.789> took<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.240> police

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
take care of that we took all the police

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.239 
take care of that we took all the police
off<00:01:28.069> belt<00:01:29.069> and<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> outer<00:01:30.890> ring<00:01:31.890> for

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
off belt and this is the outer ring for

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:40.609 
off belt and this is the outer ring for
the<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:35.039> shield<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.869> seal<00:01:39.869> for

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the the shield and this is the seal for

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.330 
the the shield and this is the seal for
the<00:01:40.799> shaft<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> basically<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> safety<00:01:44.069> tip

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the shaft so basically it's a safety tip

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
the shaft so basically it's a safety tip
as<00:01:44.549> well

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
as well

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.840

anything with high speed rotating

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.309 
anything with high speed rotating
equipment<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.719> have<00:01:48.869> any<00:01:49.020> loose

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319

objects anywhere close to the rotating

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
objects anywhere close to the rotating
parts<00:01:52.920> maybe<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.090> belt<00:01:54.389> guard<00:01:54.600> should<00:01:54.840> have

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
parts maybe this belt guard should have

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.949 
parts maybe this belt guard should have
have<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> an<00:01:55.499> additional<00:01:56.369> mesh<00:01:56.639> over<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.359> but

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
have it an additional mesh over here but

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.959 
have it an additional mesh over here but
even<00:01:58.259> though<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.310> place<00:01:59.490> anything<00:01:59.759> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969

even though you don't place anything in
this<00:02:00.060> area<00:02:00.209> I<00:02:00.630> mean<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.740> convenient

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
this area I mean it's like a convenient

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.959 
this area I mean it's like a convenient
storage<00:02:02.579> spot<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.209> isn't<00:02:03.569> so<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
storage spot but it isn't so the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.949

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
anything could work its way in today or

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.460 
anything could work its way in today or
