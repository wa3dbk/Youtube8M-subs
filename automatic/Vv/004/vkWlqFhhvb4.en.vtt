something<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.340> I'm<00:00:56.340> thinking<00:00:56.699> about

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
something out that I'm thinking about

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.349

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
so let's go ahead and get started and

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
so let's go ahead and get started and
I'm<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.310> use<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:09.479> no<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:10.080> what

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

let's not do that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
let's not do that
because<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.939> wanted<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.450> smooth<00:01:12.750> stone

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because I wanted to use smooth stone

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
with it so I have an idea let's put it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.630 
with it so I have an idea let's put it
in<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.030> tree<00:01:23.420> I'll<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.570> perfect<00:01:25.610> all<00:01:26.610> right

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in this tree I'll be perfect all right

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.440 
in this tree I'll be perfect all right
said<00:01:26.939> boat<00:01:28.220> I've<00:01:29.220> built<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.640> ladders<00:01:30.060> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
said boat I've built some ladders here

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
said boat I've built some ladders here
we're<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> ladders

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
we're just gonna go up with the ladders

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
we're just gonna go up with the ladders
now<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> trick<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.060> ladders<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.869> do

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
now the trick with ladders is you can do

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.499 
now the trick with ladders is you can do
every<00:01:34.290> other<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.689> still<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.229> work

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
every other one and it still will work

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.270 
every other one and it still will work
you'll<00:01:39.509> still<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.380> ladder

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.679 

and<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.490> think<00:01:46.880> there's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.150> spider<00:01:47.450> here

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
and I think there's a spider here

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.460 
and I think there's a spider here
somewhere<00:01:49.750> because<00:01:50.750> if<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.020> haven't<00:01:51.200> checked

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
somewhere because if you haven't checked

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.080 
somewhere because if you haven't checked

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
these around the outside like this I get

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120 
these around the outside like this I get
so<00:05:31.030> lucky<00:05:31.210> that<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.990> dimensions<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:32.949> this

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
so lucky that the dimensions of this

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.110 
so lucky that the dimensions of this
outside<00:05:33.570> wall<00:05:34.570> here<00:05:34.840> it's<00:05:34.990> perfect

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
outside wall here it's perfect

alright so now we have look at our and
up<00:05:46.930> over<00:05:47.880> well<00:05:48.880> let's<00:05:49.060> just<00:05:49.210> do<00:05:49.479> that<00:05:49.510> that<00:05:49.750> was

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
up over well let's just do that that was

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.060 
up over well let's just do that that was
stacked<00:05:50.050> once<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:53.560> could<00:05:53.680> use<00:05:53.830> cobblestone

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
stacked once you could use cobblestone

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.300 
stacked once you could use cobblestone
as<00:05:54.520> well<00:05:54.669> but<00:05:54.880> who<00:05:55.000> cares<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.949> makes<00:06:00.100> more

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
as well but who cares that it makes more

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:09.950 
as well but who cares that it makes more
torches<00:06:00.580> first<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:05.200> now<00:06:05.320> you<00:06:05.380> can<00:06:05.620> do<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:05.979> in

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.050 

you<00:06:10.960> can<00:06:11.139> do<00:06:11.260> this<00:06:11.440> in<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:12.099> tree<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.760> can<00:06:12.940> do

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
you can do this in a tree you can do

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.680 
you can do this in a tree you can do
this<00:06:14.160> as<00:06:15.160> a<00:06:15.220> man-made<00:06:15.639> structure<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.450> doesn't

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
this as a man-made structure it doesn't

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.510 
this as a man-made structure it doesn't
really<00:06:16.780> matter<00:06:17.020> what<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.410> do<00:06:17.740> it<00:06:17.889> at<00:06:18.070> what<00:06:18.460> do
