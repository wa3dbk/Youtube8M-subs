00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello today is I want to tell how we can 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.510
 make this type of hanger to place 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.050
 our bracelets hanging rings and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.280
 earrings in a very original way 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.620
 the materials that we are going to use 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.300
 they would be a polyethylene ball 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.779
 small box silicone tail ornament 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.730
 and umbrella wands broken first 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.490
 What we're going to do is take the wand 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.340
 broken umbrella and let's take the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.350
 wire that leads inside then 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 to remove it the only thing we're going to do 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.039
 is to cut it in the area here with the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.039
 pliers 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.330
 and take it out 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.260
 Now what we are going to do is take the 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.450
 umbrella wand and stay with this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.190
 area here and that we're going to remove 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.320
 screw that has 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.290
 inside 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.110
 that we already have it separated what we're going 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.540
 to do next is that this area 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.650
 from here we are going to cut it with a plier 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.650
 a little stronger 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.420
 what we are going to do is remove this and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.190
 take out the wand with a subject and with the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.210
 other 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.210
 let's go separating what 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 once we had already separated 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.909
 Pretty the wand comes out without problem 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 so what we are going to do is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.649
 take out the wires from all the rods 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 of the umbrellas with the wire that we have 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.049
 pulled out of the wand what we 're going to do 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.390
 is that in this area here we are going to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.260
 rotate it to form a circle 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.410
 asif 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.140
 and we will go forming drawings and shapes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.430
 as we like, for example, we can 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 do here one more circle is a wire 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.060
 difficult to handle hard serves us very 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.190
 well to then hold the rings and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.590
 the earrings and that we do not fall 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.370
 then we are doing turns like that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.320
 giving it shape as we like 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.270
 we can make another turn here and once 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.040
 that we have given it the form that most 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.690
 like what we're going to do is join this 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.820
 end of the wire with the wand 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.470
 so for this what we are going to do 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.420
 is to turn the wire in this way 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.990
 place it at the height that we want it to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.260
 go on the wand for example here do you 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:46.140
 pressure and we go rolling what 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.930
 around the wand we do a lot 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.750
 pressure so that it is properly attached to the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.069
 wand and the end of the wire thread 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.980
 we close it well so they do not stick 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.180
 once we have it properly 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.689
 for the wand 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.750
 the umbrella would stay like this 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.810
 wire now we will place it as 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.640
 we like it better so let's go 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.760
 doing with all the wires of the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.700
 umbrella wands once you already 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.519
 we have placed all the wires in the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.639
 umbrella wand would stay like that 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.219
 you can move to the side that 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.639
 We want that depends how you want 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:33.639
 you and if some of us are going 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.409
 dripping down and we want that 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.209
 do not move us the only thing that we have to 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.090
 do is throw a little tail of 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.750
 silicone in the base with the union of 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.169
 wire and we would have it now what 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.409
 Let's do is take the box that 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.419
 we have for example this one here I 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.629
 I have this one here and what we're going to 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.909
 to do is cut half of the ball of 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.510
 paul steele in o that I already have 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.620
 cut also here would stay like that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.530
 then we are going to introduce 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.900
 the wire so that it is well secured 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.010
 to the polystyrene ball what are we going 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.079
 to do is to throw all this area of 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.459
 here with the silicone to be able 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.560
 paste it 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.069
 once we have cast enough cola 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.490
 of silicone we are going to place it in our 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:30.190
 box gives you let's make pressure to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.590
 it is firmly stuck once and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.479
 we have it well stuck what we are going to 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.330
 do is place and throw also 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.250
 silicone glue adhesive in the base 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.699
 where it is inserted in the ball of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.699
 polystyrene 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.030
 and we will leave so that it stays well 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.770
 stuck once we have it stuck 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.360
 we can cast colored pebbles and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.570
 cover what is the ball of Paul Steele 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.770
 not also what we can do is 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.080
 put ornaments like little bows 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.930
 once we have placed the 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.030
 rings the earrings and the bracelets are 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.850
 we would stay like this I hope that I have 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.410
 liked this tutorial and see you in the 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.410
 next thanks
