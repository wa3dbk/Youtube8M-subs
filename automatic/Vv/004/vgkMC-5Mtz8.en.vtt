yeah<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.990> start<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.650> my<00:00:04.759> head<00:00:05.759> gasket

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
yeah this is the start of my head gasket

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.560 
yeah this is the start of my head gasket
failure<00:00:06.600> test<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.820> hook<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.540> my

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
failure test I'm going to hook up my

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.440 
failure test I'm going to hook up my
tester<00:00:10.469> kit<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.700> vacuum<00:00:12.210> line<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
tester kit to the vacuum line I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.530 
tester kit to the vacuum line I
disconnected<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.500> right<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.540> don't

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
disconnected this right here I don't

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.150 
disconnected this right here I don't
know<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.929> goes<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.350> specifically<00:00:17.039> but

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
know what this goes to specifically but

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.130 
know what this goes to specifically but
I'm<00:00:17.279> guessing<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:17.970> climate<00:00:18.330> control<00:00:18.690> on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I'm guessing it's for climate control on

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.550 
I'm guessing it's for climate control on
this<00:00:19.619> right<00:00:19.920> side<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:21.109> this<00:00:22.109> piece<00:00:22.320> right

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this right side here this piece right

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
this right side here this piece right
here<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.920> soon<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.279> disconnected<00:00:23.939> these

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
here as soon as I disconnected these

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.839 
here as soon as I disconnected these
there<00:00:24.330> was<00:00:24.390> definitely<00:00:24.930> some<00:00:25.320> air<00:00:25.590> sucking<00:00:26.550> in

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
there was definitely some air sucking in

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.550 
there was definitely some air sucking in
through<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:27.840> assuming<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
through here so I'm assuming this is the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
through here so I'm assuming this is the
source<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> my<00:00:29.189> vacuum<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.119> I'm

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
source of my vacuum this is where I'm

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.430 
source of my vacuum this is where I'm
going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> try<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.750> hook<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:32.870> okay<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.170> have

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
going to try and hook up okay now have

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
going to try and hook up okay now have
my<00:00:34.739> hose<00:00:35.329> seen<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:38.010> came<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.489> tester

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
my hose seen here it came with my tester

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
my hose seen here it came with my tester
kit<00:00:39.270> hooked<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> left<00:00:40.500> side<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
kit hooked up to the left side of the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.299 
kit hooked up to the left side of the
tee<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:43.350> gonna<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> car<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
tee and I'm gonna start the car in a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.040 
tee and I'm gonna start the car in a

second and make sure I'm getting suction

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
second and make sure I'm getting suction

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.859 
the back of the lovely bottle here yeah
you<00:01:13.020> can't<00:01:13.260> read<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.000> for<00:01:15.000> starting<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you can't read that for starting the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
you can't read that for starting the
engine<00:01:16.229> while<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> engine<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> cold<00:01:17.340> or

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
coolant to 2 to 3 inches below the
opening<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.509> coolant<00:01:21.869> cannot<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> drawn<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
opening so coolant cannot be drawn to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.969 
opening so coolant cannot be drawn to
the<00:01:22.890> dust<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> tester<00:01:24.530> obviously<00:01:25.530> save

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the dust into the tester obviously save

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
the dust into the tester obviously save
your<00:01:26.189> coolant<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.820> need<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> replace<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
your coolant you will need to replace it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.380 
your coolant you will need to replace it
when<00:01:27.630> done<00:01:27.840> testing<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.860> pretty<00:01:29.430> sure<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.000> have

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
when done testing I'm pretty sure I have

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
when done testing I'm pretty sure I have
at<00:01:30.720> least<00:01:30.930> 2<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> 3<00:01:31.470> inches<00:01:31.950> under<00:01:32.250> here

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
at least 2 to 3 inches under here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.760 
at least 2 to 3 inches under here
already<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> we're<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> verify

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
already so we're just going to verify

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.469 
already so we're just going to verify
that<00:01:35.040> oh<00:01:37.549> yeah<00:01:38.549> there's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and of course it's green which is a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
and of course it's green which is a
whole<00:01:47.640> nother<00:01:47.820> matter<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.960> deal

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
whole nother matter that we have to deal
