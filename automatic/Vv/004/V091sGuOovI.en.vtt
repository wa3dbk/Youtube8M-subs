00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
is the base coat that I've been using
lately<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.110> helping<00:01:34.290> my

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
lately I don't know if it's helping my

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
lately I don't know if it's helping my
nails<00:01:34.619> grow<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.400> seem<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> little

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
nails grow if they seem to be a little

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
nails grow if they seem to be a little
bit<00:01:36.180> stronger<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.950> I've

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
bit stronger but this is just what I've

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.450 
bit stronger but this is just what I've
been<00:01:38.070> using<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.180> regular

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.580 

so<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.789> step<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> obviously<00:01:48.750> optional<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so this step is obviously optional I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.700 
so this step is obviously optional I
like<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.280> peel<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.939> backing<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.990> Center

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
like to peel the backing or Center

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.169 
like to peel the backing or Center
stripping<00:01:53.429> whatever<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.819> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> call<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
stripping whatever you want to call it

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.599 
stripping whatever you want to call it
out<00:01:54.689> from<00:01:55.020> around<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.710> actual<00:01:56.069> nail<00:01:56.219> wraps<00:01:56.429> I

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
out from around the actual nail wraps I

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.219 
out from around the actual nail wraps I
find<00:01:56.819> that<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> makes<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.360> easier<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
find that it makes it a little easier to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.839 
find that it makes it a little easier to
remove<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.069> a<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.429> this<00:02:00.060> way

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.630 

so<00:02:08.849> next<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.569> measure<00:02:10.019> which<00:02:10.530> strip<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.430> think

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so next up I measure which strip I think

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.729 
so next up I measure which strip I think
will<00:02:11.790> fit<00:02:11.940> best<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.720> finger<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.290> take<00:02:13.530> my

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
will fit best on my finger I take my

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.850 
will fit best on my finger I take my
tweezers<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.760> carefully<00:02:15.599> remove<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.560> wrap

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
tweezers and I carefully remove the wrap

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.460 
tweezers and I carefully remove the wrap
from<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.370> actual<00:02:18.000> backing<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.349> I'm

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
from the actual backing and then I'm

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.190 
from the actual backing and then I'm
going<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.819> Center<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.849> over<00:02:21.269> my<00:02:21.390> nail<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.900> kind

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
going to Center it over my nail and kind

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440 
going to Center it over my nail and kind
of<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:23.220> takes<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.580> lot<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> time<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.360> on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
of it takes a lot of time to get it on

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.479 
of it takes a lot of time to get it on
there<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.140> set<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.590> let

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
there you kind of set it down let

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.910 
there you kind of set it down let
lightly<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.060> first<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.379> can<00:02:28.799> kind

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
lightly at first and then you can kind

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.619 
lightly at first and then you can kind
of<00:02:29.040> push<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> down<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.970> more<00:02:30.180> settled

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
of push it down and get it more settled

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.570 
of push it down and get it more settled
in<00:02:30.750> once<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.290> know<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:31.980> exactly<00:02:32.400> where

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
in once you know that it's exactly where

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.470 
in once you know that it's exactly where
you<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.459> after<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> wrap<00:02:36.299> all

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
you want it so after I have the wrap all

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.539 
you want it so after I have the wrap all
smooth<00:02:36.959> down<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.680> take<00:02:37.920> another<00:02:38.069> one<00:02:38.459> of

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
smooth down I then take another one of

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.069 
smooth down I then take another one of
my<00:02:38.610> fingernails<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.390> push<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.870> down

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
my fingernails and I push it down

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.440 
my fingernails and I push it down
underneath<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.950> tip<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.340> my<00:02:41.489> nail<00:02:41.640> as<00:02:41.880> much<00:02:42.299> as

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
underneath the tip of my nail as much as

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.509 
underneath the tip of my nail as much as
I<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.500> reason<00:02:43.769> for<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
I can the reason for this is so that it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.910 
I can the reason for this is so that it
gives<00:02:44.640> me<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> nice<00:02:45.000> smooth<00:02:45.660> sharp<00:02:46.200> crisp<00:02:46.590> edge

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
gives me a nice smooth sharp crisp edge

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.330 
gives me a nice smooth sharp crisp edge
so<00:02:47.459> when<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.640> file<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.209> off<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:49.170> am<00:02:49.739> ensuring<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so when I file it off I am ensuring that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.410 
so when I file it off I am ensuring that
i<00:02:50.519> get<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> smoothest<00:02:51.660> most<00:02:52.380> perfect<00:02:52.980> most

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
i get the smoothest most perfect most

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.580 
i get the smoothest most perfect most
amazing<00:02:55.130> edge<00:02:56.130> possible<00:02:56.940> take<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> look<00:02:57.690> boom

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
amazing edge possible take a look boom

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.010 
amazing edge possible take a look boom
just<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.130> that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020
