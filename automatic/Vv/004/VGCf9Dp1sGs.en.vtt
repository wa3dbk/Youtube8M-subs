00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.570 

I<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.980> made<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.190> lot<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.520> these<00:00:08.760> chairs<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.510> a

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
I have made a lot of these chairs it's a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.610 
I have made a lot of these chairs it's a
one<00:00:11.360> of<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.540> things<00:00:11.780> that's<00:00:11.900> key<00:00:12.170> to<00:00:12.380> making

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
one of the things that's key to making

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.130 
one of the things that's key to making
the

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.830 
the
look<00:00:13.290> good<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.920> both<00:00:14.550> legs<00:00:14.970> need<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.720> be

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
look good is that both legs need to be

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.660 
look good is that both legs need to be
exactly<00:00:16.470> identical<00:00:16.590> they<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
exactly identical they have to be the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.790 
exactly identical they have to be the
same<00:00:17.850> shape<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.780> easiest<00:00:19.170> way<00:00:19.290> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.590> that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
same shape the easiest way to make that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.730 
same shape the easiest way to make that
happen<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.000> use<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.360> pattern<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.500> one

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
happen is to use a pattern like this one

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.340 
happen is to use a pattern like this one
so<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.610> pattern<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> exact<00:00:24.840> shape<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so this pattern is the exact shape of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.190 
so this pattern is the exact shape of
the<00:00:25.710> back<00:00:25.920> leg<00:00:25.950> in<00:00:26.550> addition<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.570> giving<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
the back leg in addition to giving the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.409 
the back leg in addition to giving the
shape<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> leg<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.160> also<00:00:29.610> provides<00:00:30.119> all

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
shape of the leg it also provides all

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.950 
shape of the leg it also provides all
the<00:00:30.450> mortis<00:00:30.869> locations<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> leg<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:33.329> when

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the mortis locations of the leg so when

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.640 
the mortis locations of the leg so when
I<00:00:33.990> make<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.470> legs<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.329> start<00:00:36.840> by

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
I make the legs what I do is start by

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.790 
I make the legs what I do is start by
cutting<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.340> leg<00:00:38.730> blank<00:00:39.350> larger<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
cutting my leg blank larger than the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.370 
cutting my leg blank larger than the
finish<00:00:41.100> size<00:00:41.310> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> took<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:42.000> wood<00:00:42.270> set<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
finish size so I took my wood set the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.590 
finish size so I took my wood set the
template<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.310> traced<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.060> then

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
template on here and traced it and then

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
template on here and traced it and then
on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> bandsaw<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> cut<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.770> sixteenth

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
on the bandsaw I cut about a sixteenth

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700 
on the bandsaw I cut about a sixteenth
of<00:00:47.370> an<00:00:47.489> inch<00:00:47.579> outside<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.300> line<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of an inch outside the line now what we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.549 
of an inch outside the line now what we
need<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> material<00:00:52.050> trimmed

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
need to do is get the material trimmed

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.279 
need to do is get the material trimmed
so<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> perfect<00:00:54.210> match<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.719> template

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so it's a perfect match to the template

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
so it's a perfect match to the template
and<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> call<00:00:56.519> for<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.000> like

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and that's going to call for a bit like

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.740 
and that's going to call for a bit like
this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.349 
this
this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.800> called<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> flush<00:00:59.399> trim<00:00:59.640> router<00:01:00.030> bit

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this is called a flush trim router bit

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
this is called a flush trim router bit
the<00:01:01.079> bearing<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> cutter<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.579> exactly

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the bearing and the cutter are exactly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.150 
the bearing and the cutter are exactly
the<00:01:03.179> same<00:01:03.420> diameter<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.620> whatever<00:01:04.980> the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
the same diameter so whatever the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.820 
the same diameter so whatever the
bearing<00:01:05.489> rides<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
bearing rides on it's going to make the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580 
bearing rides on it's going to make the
shape<00:01:08.100> below<00:01:08.430> exactly<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.120> same<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.440> need

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
shape below exactly the same so we need

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
shape below exactly the same so we need
a<00:01:10.620> couple<00:01:10.800> things<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.640> cutter<00:01:11.850> flush

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a couple things out of this cutter flush

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
a couple things out of this cutter flush
trim<00:01:12.570> bits<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.990> available<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
trim bits are available in a lot of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.550 
trim bits are available in a lot of
different<00:01:14.130> sizes<00:01:14.450> looking<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
different sizes looking at this one it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
different sizes looking at this one it's
a<00:01:16.740> big<00:01:17.010> beefy<00:01:17.549> bit<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.600> important

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a big beefy bit that's very important

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.310 
a big beefy bit that's very important
because<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.159> leg<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.790> thick<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.960> bid<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
because the leg is so thick the bid is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
because the leg is so thick the bid is
sticking<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> long<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> router

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
sticking a long way up out of the router

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.450 
sticking a long way up out of the router
table<00:01:24.329> so<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> had<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> small<00:01:25.920> bit<00:01:26.189> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
table so if we had a small bit that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
table so if we had a small bit that
couldn't<00:01:26.729> take<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:27.960> chatter<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
couldn't take that it would chatter and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
couldn't take that it would chatter and
that<00:01:28.649> chatter<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.820> Telegraph<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.570> our

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that chatter would Telegraph into our

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
that chatter would Telegraph into our
work<00:01:30.960> we'd<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.439> sorts<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> sanding<00:01:32.189> to

work we'd have all sorts of sanding to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
work we'd have all sorts of sanding to
do<00:01:32.430> later<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.630> cut<00:01:33.840> quality<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> bid

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
do later the cut quality from this bid

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.170 
do later the cut quality from this bid
is<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.490> nice<00:01:35.700> they'll<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.060> very

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
is going to be so nice they'll be very

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
is going to be so nice they'll be very
little<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.689> any<00:01:36.869> sanding<00:01:37.320> required<00:01:37.649> when

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
little if any sanding required when

to the pattern and to the material
doesn't<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.219> a<00:01:53.250> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> fact<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
doesn't take a lot of it in fact if you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.209 
doesn't take a lot of it in fact if you
use<00:01:55.049> too<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.469> it<00:01:55.710> you'll<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
use too much of it you'll just have a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.630 
use too much of it you'll just have a
hard<00:01:56.460> time<00:01:56.670> separating<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.390> two<00:01:57.570> later<00:02:01.640> with

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
hard time separating the two later with

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
hard time separating the two later with
the<00:02:02.789> second<00:02:03.210> paper<00:02:03.420> layer<00:02:03.750> taken<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the second paper layer taken off of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.580 
the second paper layer taken off of the
tape<00:02:04.829> now<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.789> put<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.000> pattern<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:07.409> want

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
tape now I can put my pattern on we want

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
tape now I can put my pattern on we want
to<00:02:07.649> make<00:02:07.710> sure<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.630> pattern<00:02:09.990> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to make sure that the pattern is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.800 
to make sure that the pattern is
positioned<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.820> first<00:02:12.150> time<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.630> goes

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
positioned right the first time it goes

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.650 
positioned right the first time it goes
on<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.560> tape<00:02:13.830> grabs<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.670> well<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
on because that tape grabs so well you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.680 
on because that tape grabs so well you
can<00:02:15.870> only<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.410> shot<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.149 

with<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.810> pattern<00:02:26.200> adhered<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> blank

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
with the pattern adhered to the blank

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.789 
with the pattern adhered to the blank
now<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.819> see<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.260> leg<00:02:29.470> blank

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
now you can see that the leg blank

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.860 
now you can see that the leg blank
itself<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.549> larger<00:02:31.000> than<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.299> pattern<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
itself is larger than the pattern and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.809 
itself is larger than the pattern and
that's<00:02:32.379> what<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.739> flush<00:02:33.010> trim<00:02:33.280> bit<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.610> fix

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
that's what the flush trim bit will fix

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:44.190 
that's what the flush trim bit will fix
for<00:02:34.060> us

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.590 

I've<00:02:45.200> got<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.620> height<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.040> bit<00:02:46.220> set<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
I've got the height of the bit set so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.910 
I've got the height of the bit set so
that<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.840> bearing<00:02:47.990> will<00:02:48.440> write<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.830> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that the bearing will write on the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.460 
that the bearing will write on the
pattern<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.480> top<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.050> cutter<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
pattern and the top of the cutter is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.050 
pattern and the top of the cutter is
just<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.740> little<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.160> above<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.610> top<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
just a little bit above the top of the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.120 
just a little bit above the top of the
material<00:02:53.180> at<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.110> point<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.620> turn<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
material at this point I can turn on the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.030 
material at this point I can turn on the
router<00:02:55.280> ease<00:02:56.270> into<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.870> bit<00:02:57.200> get<00:02:57.800> on<00:02:57.920> the

router ease into that bit get on the
ball<00:02:58.190> bearing<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.850> trim<00:02:59.450> away<00:02:59.660> all<00:02:59.810> the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
ball bearing and trim away all the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:17.360 
ball bearing and trim away all the
excess

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.809 

once<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.540> flush<00:03:18.780> trim<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.319> done<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.459> can<00:03:20.610> take

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
once the flush trim is done we can take

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.030 
once the flush trim is done we can take
the<00:03:20.970> pattern<00:03:21.209> off<00:03:24.170> remove<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.349> tape<00:03:25.560> residue

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the pattern off remove the tape residue

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.119 
the pattern off remove the tape residue
and<00:03:26.250> now<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.440> how<00:03:28.560> smooth<00:03:29.099> that

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
and now you can see just how smooth that

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.150 
and now you can see just how smooth that
is<00:03:29.370> even<00:03:30.209> more<00:03:30.239> importantly<00:03:31.019> every<00:03:31.769> leg<00:03:32.010> we
