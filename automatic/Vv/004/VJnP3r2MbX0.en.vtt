00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
about pretty much kill stings kill

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.070 
about pretty much kill stings kill
streaks<00:06:11.130> and<00:06:11.340> pretty<00:06:11.610> much<00:06:11.730> camping<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.450> mean

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
streaks and pretty much camping I mean

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.200 
streaks and pretty much camping I mean
the<00:06:13.680> quick<00:06:13.890> scope<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.400> all<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.820> stuff<00:06:15.030> is

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
the quick scope and all that stuff is

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.670 
the quick scope and all that stuff is
good<00:06:15.420> the<00:06:15.570> quick<00:06:15.750> scope<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.110> drop<00:06:16.290> shot<00:06:16.500> it's

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
good the quick scope the drop shot it's

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.310 
good the quick scope the drop shot it's
all<00:06:16.800> good<00:06:17.040> but<00:06:17.250> I<00:06:17.460> think<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.300> strafe<00:06:18.630> least

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
all good but I think the strafe least

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.280 
all good but I think the strafe least
the<00:06:19.470> drop<00:06:19.710> shot<00:06:20.010> I<00:06:20.220> think<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.120> noscope<00:06:21.600> beats

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
the drop shot I think the noscope beats

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.620 
the drop shot I think the noscope beats
the<00:06:22.500> quick<00:06:22.740> scope<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.250> obviously<00:06:24.210> everything

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
the quick scope and obviously everything

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.900 
the quick scope and obviously everything
beats<00:06:25.440> camping<00:06:25.920> so<00:06:26.550> but<00:06:27.510> umm<00:06:27.690> I<00:06:28.520> just<00:06:29.520> pretty

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
beats camping so but umm I just pretty

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.350 
beats camping so but umm I just pretty
much<00:06:29.970> feel<00:06:30.300> that<00:06:30.690> if<00:06:31.650> you<00:06:31.710> were<00:06:31.860> to<00:06:32.100> compare

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
much feel that if you were to compare

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.020 
much feel that if you were to compare
somebody<00:06:33.360> in<00:06:33.690> Halo<00:06:34.080> that<00:06:35.010> gets<00:06:35.190> 30<00:06:35.430> kills<00:06:35.790> in
