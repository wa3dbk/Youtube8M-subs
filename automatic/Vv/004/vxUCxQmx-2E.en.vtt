00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
why adulterates it with spices such as

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
why adulterates it with spices such as
nutmeg<00:02:05.430> cinnamon<00:02:05.640> when<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.900> just<00:02:06.990> let

the natural flavors of the ingredients
speak<00:02:09.540> for<00:02:09.810> themselves<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.710> stays<00:02:10.890> for

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
speak for themselves so it stays for

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860

simplest and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.170 
simplest and
why<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.490> we<00:02:17.610> make<00:02:17.730> things<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.030> complicated

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
why do we make things so complicated

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.840 
why do we make things so complicated

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
so rich I mean you can imagine the skill

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
so rich I mean you can imagine the skill
needed<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.330> work<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.350> sort<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.830> near<00:02:41.040> dough

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
needed to work this sort of near dough

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
needed to work this sort of near dough
because<00:02:42.090> because<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.510> got<00:02:42.660> such<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> high

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
because because it's got such a high

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.990 
because because it's got such a high
water<00:02:43.350> content<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.070> it's<00:02:44.190> very<00:02:44.430> rich<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
water content and it's very rich you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.370 
water content and it's very rich you
know<00:02:45.360> last<00:02:45.570> week<00:02:45.630> when<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:45.959> trying<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
know last week when I was trying the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.550 
know last week when I was trying the
recipe<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.950> did<00:02:47.640> use<00:02:47.850> homemade<00:02:48.840> puff<00:02:49.080> pastry

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
recipe I did use homemade puff pastry

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
recipe I did use homemade puff pastry
and<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.550> didn't<00:02:50.820> work<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.390> didn't<00:02:51.660> have

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and it didn't work and it didn't have

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.470 
and it didn't work and it didn't have
the<00:02:52.020> same<00:02:52.200> effect<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:53.580> looking<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the same effect just looking to this and

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.710 
the same effect just looking to this and
seeing<00:02:55.020> this<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.459> recipe<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.660> how

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
seeing this this this recipe and how

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.410 
seeing this this this recipe and how
buttery<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:59.489> see<00:02:59.730> why<00:02:59.940> now<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.300> gets

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
buttery it is I can see why now it gets

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
buttery it is I can see why now it gets
that<00:03:00.600> flakiness<00:03:01.080> with<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> way<00:03:01.800> you've

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that flakiness with with the way you've

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620 
that flakiness with with the way you've
made<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.820> I've<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:03.239> got<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.420> come

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
made it I think I've really got to come

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
made it I think I've really got to come
back<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.989> roots<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.530> recipe<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.100> to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
back to the roots of the recipe and to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.930 
back to the roots of the recipe and to
fall<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.600> me<00:03:06.690> I've<00:03:06.780> got<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.989> start<00:03:07.170> again<00:03:07.940> and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
fall for me I've got to start again and

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.360 
fall for me I've got to start again and
his<00:03:09.420> Eccles<00:03:09.900> cake<00:03:10.200> education<00:03:10.800> doesn't<00:03:11.220> end

his Eccles cake education doesn't end

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.850 
his Eccles cake education doesn't end
there<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.540> final<00:03:12.900> stage<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.320> bring<00:03:13.680> all

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
there the final stage is to bring all

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220 
there the final stage is to bring all
the<00:03:14.010> ingredients<00:03:14.130> together<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.959> largely

the ingredients together this is largely
done<00:03:16.470> by<00:03:16.500> hand<00:03:17.010> as<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> machine<00:03:17.820> would<00:03:18.030> break<00:03:18.330> up

the fruit and ruin the fillings
consistency<00:03:20.870> even<00:03:21.870> though<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
consistency even though this is a

consistency even though this is a
labor-intensive<00:03:22.920> process<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.390> factory

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
labor-intensive process the factory

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.259 
sort of quantity one or two shouldn't be
missed<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:33.410> think<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.620> key<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.799> these<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:36.030> to

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
missed I think the key to these is to

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.759 
missed I think the key to these is to
keep<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> traditional<00:03:36.660> there's<00:03:37.470> no<00:03:37.560> need<00:03:37.739> for

keep it traditional there's no need for

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.259 
keep it traditional there's no need for
me<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:37.980> change<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.430> no<00:03:38.760> because<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.180> is
