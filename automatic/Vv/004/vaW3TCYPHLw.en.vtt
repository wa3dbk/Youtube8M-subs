00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
adapter so you'll need to buy one if

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.449 
adapter so you'll need to buy one if
you're<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> install<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
you're going to install it in the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're going to install it in the
desktop<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
desktop and you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.160 
desktop and you
have<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.909> case<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.209> natively<00:02:13.689> support

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
have a case that natively support

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.800 
have a case that natively support
student<00:02:14.500> half-inch<00:02:14.799> dreads<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.670> while<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.689> is

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
student half-inch dreads so while it is

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.949 
student half-inch dreads so while it is
a<00:02:16.840> mainstream<00:02:17.739> drive<00:02:18.010> remember<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.540> was<00:02:19.780> only

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
a mainstream drive remember it was only

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.899 
a mainstream drive remember it was only
last<00:02:20.290> generate<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.069> last<00:02:21.280> generation<00:02:21.849> of

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
last generate the last generation of

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.940 
last generate the last generation of
products<00:02:22.420> where<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.629> vertex<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.590> reigned

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
products where the vertex to reigned

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.819 
products where the vertex to reigned
supreme<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.879> this<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> faster<00:02:26.290> than<00:02:26.409> a<00:02:26.470> vertex

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
supreme and this is faster than a vertex

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.280 
supreme and this is faster than a vertex
-<00:02:27.099> so<00:02:27.579> we're<00:02:27.760> only<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.239> generation<00:02:28.720> behind

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
- so we're only one generation behind

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.830 
- so we're only one generation behind
the<00:02:29.940> high-performance<00:02:30.940> parts<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.480> terms<00:02:31.690> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the high-performance parts in terms of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.619 
the high-performance parts in terms of
performance<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.159> mainstream<00:02:33.549> part<00:02:34.180> so

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
performance on this mainstream part so

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.119 
performance on this mainstream part so
the<00:02:34.780> drive<00:02:34.959> looks<00:02:35.290> pretty<00:02:35.530> typical<00:02:35.769> this

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
the drive looks pretty typical this

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.830 
the drive looks pretty typical this
looks<00:02:36.430> pretty<00:02:36.730> much<00:02:36.970> oh<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.599> kind<00:02:37.750> of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
looks pretty much oh this is kind of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.300 
looks pretty much oh this is kind of
interesting<00:02:38.079> actually<00:02:38.470> check<00:02:38.829> this<00:02:38.950> out<00:02:39.129> so

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
interesting actually check this out so

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.009 
interesting actually check this out so
compared<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.599> know<00:02:40.659> what<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.870> actually

there's<00:02:46.930> my<00:02:47.140> 510<00:02:47.829> with<00:02:48.069> kind<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.549> Goldy

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
there's my 510 with kind of a Goldy

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.879 
there's my 510 with kind of a Goldy
finish<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.930> on<00:02:50.019> my<00:02:50.140> test<00:02:50.379> bench<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.739> see

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
finish on it on my test bench you see

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.520 
finish on it on my test bench you see
that<00:02:51.069> okay<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.760> look<00:02:51.909> at<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.060> 510<00:02:52.389> now<00:02:53.049> look<00:02:53.379> at

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
that okay so look at the 510 now look at

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.610 
that okay so look at the 510 now look at
the<00:02:53.650> 320<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.459> 320<00:02:55.030> brings<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:55.900> this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the 320 so the 320 brings back this

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.860 
the 320 so the 320 brings back this
little<00:02:57.099> plastic<00:02:57.579> piece<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.120> which

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
little plastic piece here which

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.050 
little plastic piece here which
increases<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.829> compatibility<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.790> this

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
increases the compatibility of this

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.149 
increases the compatibility of this

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
back in and now all of a sudden you have

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.890 
back in and now all of a sudden you have
a<00:03:17.829> slimmer<00:03:18.190> profile<00:03:18.699> drive<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.419> spacer

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
a slimmer profile drive so this spacer

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.720 
a slimmer profile drive so this spacer
here<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.859> it'll<00:03:21.010> also<00:03:21.250> install

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
here is so that it'll also install

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.449 
here is so that it'll also install
easily<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.389> computers<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.379> do<00:03:24.099> not<00:03:24.250> require

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
easily in computers that do not require

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.520 
easily in computers that do not require
the<00:03:24.819> slimmer<00:03:25.030> drive<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.139> front<00:03:26.260> you'll

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
the slimmer drive so on the front you'll

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.259 
the slimmer drive so on the front you'll
find<00:03:26.590> information<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.669> part<00:03:27.970> number

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
find information like the part number

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.530 
find information like the part number
