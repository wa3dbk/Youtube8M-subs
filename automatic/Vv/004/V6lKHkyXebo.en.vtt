00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
like to do loads because my hair is so
thin<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.030> doesn't<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.390> anything<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
thin and it just doesn't do anything so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350 
thin and it just doesn't do anything so
you<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.040> backcomb<00:01:38.430> loads<00:01:38.970> into

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you kind of have to backcomb loads into

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.810 
you kind of have to backcomb loads into
my<00:01:39.509> hair<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> until<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.369> looks<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.770 

another<00:01:47.820> section<00:01:49.700> from<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:51.000> behind<00:01:51.390> there

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.260 

again<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.700> up

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.430 

then<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.620> need<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.800> do<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.400> kind<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.440> with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
then what you need to do is kind of with

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.050

extensions it's gonna be hard to try and
cover<00:03:03.520> them<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.090> haven't<00:03:04.209> got<00:03:04.330> hair

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
extensions and you've got long hair then

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.870 
extensions and you've got long hair then
go<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.739> see<00:03:09.299> if<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.540> even<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:15.610> that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
go you but to see if it's even like that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.220 
go you but to see if it's even like that
so<00:03:16.480> then<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.930> bouffant<00:03:17.110> is<00:03:17.709> done<00:03:18.959> now<00:03:19.959> we're

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
so then the bouffant is done now we're

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.680 
so then the bouffant is done now we're
basically<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.250> two<00:03:21.489> braids<00:03:22.060> here<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.510> can

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
basically the two braids here you can

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.080 
basically the two braids here you can
either<00:03:22.810> do<00:03:23.080> normal<00:03:23.650> braids<00:03:23.950> or<00:03:24.280> fishtail<00:03:24.820> I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
either do normal braids or fishtail I

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.910 
either do normal braids or fishtail I
tend<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:25.630> fishtail<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:26.440> because<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.769> think

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
tend to do fishtail just because I think

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.400 
tend to do fishtail just because I think
they<00:03:27.280> look<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.519> bit<00:03:27.670> nicer<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.570> don't<00:03:29.230> know<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
they look a bit nicer I don't know you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.360 
they look a bit nicer I don't know you
can<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.650> whatever<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.190> like

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
can do whatever you like

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.770 
can do whatever you like
I<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:30.790> fishtail<00:03:31.269> look<00:03:31.420> really<00:03:31.660> nice

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
I just think fishtail look really nice

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.600 
I just think fishtail look really nice
and<00:03:31.989> you've<00:03:32.110> got<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:32.410> ombre<00:03:32.799> or<00:03:33.130> highlights

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
I'll show you how I do this so I just

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.090 
I'll show you how I do this so I just
grab<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:42.850> put<00:03:43.239> my<00:03:43.330> hair<00:03:43.540> into<00:03:43.690> two<00:03:43.989> sections

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
grab like put my hair into two sections

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.970 
grab like put my hair into two sections
and<00:03:45.100> then<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:46.090> grab<00:03:46.209> one<00:03:46.540> side<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.320> tend<00:03:47.799> to

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
and then just grab one side I tend to

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.100 
and then just grab one side I tend to
leave<00:03:48.310> these<00:03:48.640> orbits<00:03:49.090> out<00:03:49.330> not<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.840> get<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.080> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
leave these orbits out not to get in the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.630 
leave these orbits out not to get in the
braid<00:03:50.410> because<00:03:50.590> we're<00:03:50.799> gonna<00:03:50.920> be<00:03:51.070> using<00:03:51.430> them

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
braid because we're gonna be using them

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.030 
braid because we're gonna be using them
later<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.330> sit<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.570> flip<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.590> over<00:03:53.769> Shawn

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
later and sit up flip that over Shawn

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.940 
later and sit up flip that over Shawn
surged<00:03:54.660> fish<00:03:55.660> tails<00:03:55.959> they<00:03:56.230> are<00:03:56.380> pretty<00:03:56.620> easy

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
surged fish tails they are pretty easy

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.620 
surged fish tails they are pretty easy
when<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.370> get<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.610> know<00:03:57.790> obviously<00:03:58.360> anyone

you so you get a section from the back
of<00:04:09.790> one<00:04:09.959> brain<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.320> strand<00:04:11.940> then<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.060> get

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
of one brain one strand then you get

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.190 
of one brain one strand then you get
another<00:04:13.450> section<00:04:13.959> from<00:04:14.819> section<00:04:15.819> from

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
another section from section from

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.180 
another section from section from
back<00:04:16.350> here<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.720> bring<00:04:19.050> it<00:04:19.170> over<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:20.040> other

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
back here and bring it over to the other

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.040 
back here and bring it over to the other
strand<00:04:20.610> it<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.360> you<00:04:21.570> get<00:04:21.690> them<00:04:21.810> from<00:04:21.990> the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
strand it going you get them from the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.370 
strand it going you get them from the
back<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.450> thin<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.900> be<00:04:25.020> thick<00:04:25.230> I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
back it can be thin it can be thick I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.960 
back it can be thin it can be thick I
think<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.650> more<00:04:25.800> effective<00:04:26.250> ones<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.850> get

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
think the more effective ones if you get

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.080 
think the more effective ones if you get
thin<00:04:27.300> strands<00:04:28.070> this<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.190> my<00:04:29.340> real<00:04:29.610> hair<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:29.880> you

thin strands this is my real hair so you
can<00:04:30.150> see<00:04:30.450> it's<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:30.870> annoying<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.560> we'll

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
can see it's really annoying so we'll

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.490 
can see it's really annoying so we'll
leave<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.520> for<00:04:32.580> later<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.840> yeah<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.140> get<00:04:34.290> one

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
leave that for later so yeah you get one

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.960 
leave that for later so yeah you get one
strand<00:04:34.830> from<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.010> back<00:04:35.280> bring<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.670> over<00:04:35.850> to

strand from the back bring it over to
the<00:04:36.060> first<00:04:36.360> strand<00:04:37.010> then<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:39.000> one<00:04:39.300> over<00:04:40.040> here

I've<00:05:26.040> just<00:05:26.070> got<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.490> much<00:05:26.700> hair<00:05:26.910> left<00:05:26.970> so<00:05:27.630> I'm

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
I've just got this much hair left so I'm

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.620 
I've just got this much hair left so I'm
going<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.400> light<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.430> bubble<00:05:29.820> before<00:05:30.389> you<00:05:30.480> put

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
going to light a bubble before you put

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.510 
going to light a bubble before you put
in<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.780> bubble<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.350> can<00:05:31.470> keep<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.130> like<00:05:32.160> this<00:05:32.280> if

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
in a bubble you can keep it like this if

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.220 
in a bubble you can keep it like this if
you<00:05:32.610> really<00:05:32.760> want<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.180> keep<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.660> neat<00:05:33.930> but

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
you really want that to keep to neat but

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.909 
you really want that to keep to neat but
I<00:05:34.380> like<00:05:34.560> my<00:05:34.889> braids<00:05:35.700> quite<00:05:36.120> thick<00:05:36.480> and<00:05:36.720> big<00:05:37.260> so

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
I like my braids quite thick and big so

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.030 
I like my braids quite thick and big so
what<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.130> tend<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:38.669> is<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:39.000> just<00:05:39.060> pull

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
what I tend to do is I just pull

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.180 
what I tend to do is I just pull
sections<00:05:41.040> out<00:05:41.370> don't<00:05:42.270> pull<00:05:42.510> too<00:05:42.750> much

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
sections out don't pull too much

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.320 
sections out don't pull too much
obviously<00:05:44.190> because<00:05:44.340> you'll<00:05:44.490> make<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.120> braid

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
obviously because you'll make the braid

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.540 
obviously because you'll make the braid
all<00:05:45.540> come<00:05:45.690> out<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:46.800> you've<00:05:46.919> got<00:05:47.070> layers<00:05:47.220> be

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
all come out and if you've got layers be

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.790 
all come out and if you've got layers be
very<00:05:47.880> careful<00:05:48.419> because<00:05:48.630> if<00:05:49.320> you're<00:05:49.500> pulling

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
very careful because if you're pulling

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.409 
very careful because if you're pulling
like<00:05:49.980> this<00:05:50.010> some<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.730> layers<00:05:50.910> come<00:05:51.180> quiet

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
like this some of the layers come quiet

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.060 
like this some of the layers come quiet
like<00:05:51.570> with<00:05:51.720> my<00:05:51.870> natural<00:05:52.350> hair<00:05:52.500> blending<00:05:52.950> in

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
like with my natural hair blending in

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.909 
like with my natural hair blending in
with<00:05:53.160> my<00:05:53.340> extensions<00:05:53.970> so<00:05:54.840> if<00:05:54.960> it<00:05:55.050> pops<00:05:55.229> out<00:05:55.530> so

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
with my extensions so if it pops out so

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.379 
with my extensions so if it pops out so
I<00:05:55.950> think<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.310> can<00:05:56.430> see<00:05:56.639> there<00:05:56.850> that's<00:05:57.060> popped

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
I think you can see there that's popped

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.680 
I think you can see there that's popped
out<00:05:57.570> there<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:58.800> yeah<00:05:59.210> literally<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.419> do

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
out there but yeah literally just do

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.520 
out there but yeah literally just do
this<00:06:01.220> as<00:06:02.220> big<00:06:02.490> as<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:03.240> want<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:04.020> like<00:06:04.260> mine

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
this as big as you want I like mine

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.610 
this as big as you want I like mine
quite<00:06:04.770> big<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.600> just<00:06:06.600> gets<00:06:06.810> eighth<00:06:07.020> bubble<00:06:07.200> I

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
quite big so just gets eighth bubble I

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.140 
quite big so just gets eighth bubble I
only<00:06:08.040> have<00:06:08.160> brown<00:06:08.430> ones<00:06:08.669> from<00:06:08.820> when<00:06:08.970> I<00:06:09.000> had

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
only have brown ones from when I had

only have brown ones from when I had
brown<00:06:09.360> hair<00:06:09.630> so<00:06:09.660> how<00:06:10.050> can<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.350> know<00:06:10.470> use<00:06:10.950> a

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
brown hair so how can you know use a

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.460 
brown hair so how can you know use a
clear<00:06:11.280> elastic<00:06:11.370> if<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.940> want<00:06:12.200> literally<00:06:13.200> just

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
clear elastic if you want literally just

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.060 
clear elastic if you want literally just
do<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:15.110> and<00:06:16.110> when<00:06:16.410> you've<00:06:16.560> got<00:06:16.590> it<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.919> you

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
do that and when you've got it in you

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.750 
do that and when you've got it in you
can<00:06:17.280> just<00:06:18.150> go<00:06:18.419> over<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:19.010> you<00:06:20.010> know<00:06:20.160> make<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.580> a

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
can just go over and you know make it a

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.400 
can just go over and you know make it a
little<00:06:21.000> bit<00:06:21.300> bigger<00:06:23.900> that's<00:06:24.900> one<00:06:25.140> of<00:06:25.260> them

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
little bit bigger that's one of them

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:36.770 
little bit bigger that's one of them
done

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.700 

so<00:06:37.780> I've<00:06:37.870> just<00:06:38.050> done<00:06:38.200> the<00:06:38.230> other<00:06:38.500> braid

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
so I've just done the other braid

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.790 
so I've just done the other braid
exactly<00:06:39.160> hide<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:39.460> this<00:06:39.640> one<00:06:40.000> and<00:06:40.590> yeah

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
exactly hide it this one and yeah

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.190 
exactly hide it this one and yeah
so<00:06:41.920> then<00:06:42.070> what<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:42.460> do<00:06:42.670> afterwards<00:06:43.450> is<00:06:43.570> you<00:06:43.870> get

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
so then what I do afterwards is you get

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.060 
so then what I do afterwards is you get
these<00:06:44.350> little<00:06:44.620> bits<00:06:44.920> here<00:06:45.040> and<00:06:46.770> get<00:06:47.770> my

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
these little bits here and get my

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.550 
these little bits here and get my
straighteners<00:06:48.760> and<00:06:49.000> then<00:06:49.750> just<00:06:50.020> curl<00:06:50.320> them

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
straighteners and then just curl them

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.170 
straighteners and then just curl them
obviously<00:06:50.770> you<00:06:51.100> don't<00:06:51.220> have<00:06:51.340> to<00:06:51.730> but<00:06:51.970> this<00:06:52.120> is

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
obviously you don't have to but this is

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.590 
obviously you don't have to but this is
how<00:06:52.510> I<00:06:52.740> won't<00:06:53.740> do<00:06:53.950> it<00:06:54.070> anyway<00:06:54.580> and<00:06:54.910> then<00:06:57.600> curl

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
how I won't do it anyway and then curl

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:11.710 
how I won't do it anyway and then curl
them

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.870 

but<00:07:12.720> then<00:07:13.140> I<00:07:13.170> do<00:07:13.440> exactly<00:07:13.980> the<00:07:14.250> same<00:07:14.520> on<00:07:14.760> the

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
but then I do exactly the same on the

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.540 
but then I do exactly the same on the
other<00:07:14.910> side<00:07:15.360> just<00:07:15.840> cut<00:07:16.650> it<00:07:16.770> up<00:07:16.860> itself<00:07:17.250> hair

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
other side just cut it up itself hair

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:28.839 
other side just cut it up itself hair
and<00:07:19.340> curl

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.389 

that<00:07:29.749> then<00:07:30.529> obviously<00:07:30.800> get<00:07:31.129> your<00:07:31.279> brush<00:07:31.779> and

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:33.399 
that then obviously get your brush and

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:39.399 
that then obviously get your brush and
just<00:07:34.399> brush<00:07:34.759> it<00:07:34.819> out<00:07:36.999> hairspray<00:07:37.999> and<00:07:38.409> just

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:39.409 
just brush it out hairspray and just

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:49.029 
just brush it out hairspray and just
spray<00:07:40.249> that<00:07:40.490> into<00:07:40.909> place<00:07:46.659> so<00:07:47.659> that<00:07:47.959> is<00:07:48.409> it<00:07:48.649> I

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 
spray that into place so that is it I

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.899 
spray that into place so that is it I
hope<00:07:49.610> you<00:07:49.819> enjoyed<00:07:50.149> it<00:07:50.389> and<00:07:50.589> I<00:07:51.589> hope<00:07:52.339> it<00:07:52.729> made
