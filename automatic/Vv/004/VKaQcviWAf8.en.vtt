probably max 600 650 coins when I do

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.099 
probably max 600 650 coins when I do
decide<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.650> sell<00:02:45.859> him<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:47.060> some<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.989> guys

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
decide to sell him now some you guys

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.750 
decide to sell him now some you guys
might<00:02:48.290> say<00:02:48.409> well<00:02:48.590> why<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:48.980> know<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:49.669> I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
might say well why you know you but I

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.250 
might say well why you know you but I
think<00:02:50.000> you'd<00:02:50.090> be<00:02:50.209> able<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.480> sell<00:02:50.659> him<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.989> for

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
think you'd be able to sell him on for

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.199 
think you'd be able to sell him on for
more<00:02:51.590> than<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.919> maybe<00:02:52.159> and<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.579> you<00:02:53.090> know

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
more than that maybe and the a you know

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.959 
more than that maybe and the a you know
maybe<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.750> really<00:02:54.049> good<00:02:54.199> day<00:02:54.379> but<00:02:54.919> when<00:02:55.669> the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
maybe on a really good day but when the

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.670 
maybe on a really good day but when the
way<00:02:56.090> French<00:02:56.449> goalkeepers<00:02:56.959> go<00:02:57.139> in<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.500> league

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
way French goalkeepers go in the league

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.770 
way French goalkeepers go in the league
one<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.099> that<00:02:58.310> they're<00:02:58.639> they're<00:02:59.329> really<00:02:59.629> not

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
one is that they're they're really not

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.929 
one is that they're they're really not
expensive<00:03:00.260> you've<00:03:00.650> got<00:03:00.859> mandanda<00:03:01.699> who's

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
expensive you've got mandanda who's

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.500 
expensive you've got mandanda who's
probably<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:03.169> most<00:03:04.159> expensive<00:03:04.730> keeper<00:03:05.269> in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
probably the most expensive keeper in

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.479 
probably the most expensive keeper in
that<00:03:05.719> league<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.139> you<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.409> still<00:03:06.650> get<00:03:06.889> him<00:03:07.159> if

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
especially when you to try think you

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.450 
especially when you to try think you
intercepted<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.710> pass<00:04:36.889> and<00:04:37.070> then<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.310> doesn't

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460
