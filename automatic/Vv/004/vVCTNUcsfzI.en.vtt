knock<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.860> review<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> see

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
knock on this review and as you can see

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
knock on this review and as you can see
your<00:00:56.190> souls<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.670> translucent<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.780> give

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
your souls are translucent they do give

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.959 
your souls are translucent they do give
your<00:00:58.199> gum<00:00:58.530> hue<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> inner

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
your gum hue that's because the inner

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.500 
your gum hue that's because the inner
lining<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.469> inner<00:01:01.680> soles<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.370> gum<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
lining on the inner soles are gum so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.329 
lining on the inner soles are gum so
that<00:01:03.690> gum<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.229> Sun<00:01:04.500> shines<00:01:04.979> through

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that gum pretty much Sun shines through

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
that gum pretty much Sun shines through
or<00:01:05.580> skins<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> gum<00:01:06.119> hue<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> can

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
or skins of the gum hue but as you can

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530 
or skins of the gum hue but as you can
see<00:01:07.229> even<00:01:07.740> better<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:09.090> actually

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
see even better right here they actually

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
see even better right here they actually
are<00:01:09.689> translucent<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> gum<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> up

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
are translucent you get the gum you up

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.090 
are translucent you get the gum you up
here<00:01:11.820> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> where<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.710> gum<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.920> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
here which is where the the gum is in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.760 
here which is where the the gum is in
the<00:01:14.159> background<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.610> course<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:16.680> course

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the background of course of course

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
the background of course of course
you're<00:01:17.130> gonna<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.490> holographic<00:01:18.270> Cady

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you're gonna have your holographic Cady

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
you're gonna have your holographic Cady
logo<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.229> wouldn't<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:19.890> without

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
logo there wouldn't be right without

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
logo there wouldn't be right without
that<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.840> holographic<00:01:21.840> background<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.740> course

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that a holographic background of course

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.910 
that a holographic background of course
and<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:24.330> actual<00:01:24.930> Cady<00:01:25.170> local<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and the actual Cady local is going to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
and the actual Cady local is going to
give<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:30.049> your<00:01:31.049> sections<00:01:31.650> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
give off a go to you your sections here

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
give off a go to you your sections here
which<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:32.939> similar<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> Sharpie
