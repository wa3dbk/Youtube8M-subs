00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you're going to want to do a straight

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're going to want to do a straight
line<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> hand<00:00:46.079> starts<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
line up to where the hand starts and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
line up to where the hand starts and
then<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> hit<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> hand<00:00:48.329> you're<00:00:48.600> going

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to go with an arc and then a straight

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
to go with an arc and then a straight
line<00:00:52.079> once<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.590> off<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> hand

line once you get off with the hand
touches<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.110> these<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.379> arcs<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.920> what's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
touches and these little arcs is what's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
touches and these little arcs is what's
going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> give<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> hand<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> 3d<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.780> first

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
going to give the hand the 3d so first

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.360 
going to give the hand the 3d so first
you're<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.500> black<00:00:58.680> into<00:00:59.250> your

you're going to go with black into your

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
you're going to go with black into your
intervals<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> hand<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
intervals all the way up the hand so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.149 
intervals all the way up the hand so
there's<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.160> another<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.789> here

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.280 

I'm<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> straight<00:01:08.610> line

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
I'm going to straight line

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
I'm going to straight line
another<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:11.360> make<00:01:12.360> sure<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.750> arc<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
another one here make sure you go arc on

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
another one here make sure you go arc on
the<00:01:13.350> finger<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.040> straight<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the finger and then straight off the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.380 
the finger and then straight off the
finger<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:16.080> there's<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.530> arc<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.549> then

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
finger so there's an arc and then

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
finger so there's an arc and then
straight<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
straight do one more so then you want to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
straight do one more so then you want to
go<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.159> next<00:01:23.430> color<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.970> we'll<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.360> Orange

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
go to your next color so we'll go Orange

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.830 
go to your next color so we'll go Orange
next<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.939> top<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> each<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
next you just go on top of each of the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
next you just go on top of each of the
black<00:01:27.990> lines<00:01:28.259> remembering<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> arc<00:01:29.579> only<00:01:30.450> over

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
black lines remembering to arc only over

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
black lines remembering to arc only over
where<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.140> hand<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
where your hand is and when you get to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
where your hand is and when you get to
the<00:01:32.700> fingers<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> finger

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the fingers make sure you are the finger

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
the fingers make sure you are the finger
and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:34.860> straight<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.430> between<00:01:35.909> them

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and then go straight in between them

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
and then go straight in between them
even<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.840> tiny<00:01:37.020> it'll<00:01:37.380> help<00:01:37.530> flip

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
even if it's really tiny it'll help flip

00:01:37.770 --> 00:02:07.370 
even if it's really tiny it'll help flip
the<00:01:37.890> effect

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.380 

okay<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:08.440> by<00:02:09.040> now<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.280> probably<00:02:09.550> get<00:02:10.240> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
okay so by now you probably get the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.000 
okay so by now you probably get the
point<00:02:10.630> as<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.960> can<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.290> made<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> bit<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.710> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
point as you can see I made a bit of a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.550 
point as you can see I made a bit of a
little<00:02:12.370> bit<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.670> mistake<00:02:12.850> there<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.630> kind<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
little bit of a mistake there I kind of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.850 
little bit of a mistake there I kind of
messed<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.190> arc<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:16.360> whatever<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.650> I'm

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
messed up the arc about whatever so I'm

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.380 
messed up the arc about whatever so I'm
not<00:02:17.950> going<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.130> finish<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.490> one<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
not going to finish this one because it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.040 
not going to finish this one because it
takes<00:02:19.630> forever<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.700> here's<00:02:21.700> another<00:02:21.970> look<00:02:22.810> at

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
takes forever but here's another look at

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.510 
takes forever but here's another look at
the<00:02:24.570> finished<00:02:25.570> one<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.050> did<00:02:26.350> before<00:02:26.520> pretty

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
the finished one I did before pretty

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.660 
the finished one I did before pretty
