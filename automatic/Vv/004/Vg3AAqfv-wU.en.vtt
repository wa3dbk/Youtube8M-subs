as<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> specs<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> boss

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
as you can see the specs are the boss

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
as you can see the specs are the boss
from<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.259> they've<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:44.250> frequency<00:01:44.880> range

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
from here they've got frequency range

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.330 
from here they've got frequency range
which<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.450> 180<00:01:46.049> Hertz<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> 20<00:01:46.649> kilohertz<00:01:46.829> if

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
which is 180 Hertz to 20 kilohertz if

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
which is 180 Hertz to 20 kilohertz if
you<00:01:47.430> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> read<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.689> pause<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
you want to read all that just pause it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.359 
you want to read all that just pause it
now<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> bore<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.770> too<00:01:50.189> many

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
now I don't want to bore you too many

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
now I don't want to bore you too many
specs<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.840> quickly<00:01:52.049> read<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
specs because you can quickly read it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
specs because you can quickly read it
well<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.189> take<00:01:53.340> forever<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.090> probably

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
well I will take forever and probably

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
well I will take forever and probably
get<00:01:54.509> distracted<00:01:54.750> whilst<00:01:55.140> reading<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.829> as

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
get distracted whilst reading out but as

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.300 
get distracted whilst reading out but as
you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.630> here<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.590> specs

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you can see there here are the specs

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.020 
you can see there here are the specs

you know give them a shake and it does
come<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.520> relative<00:02:19.180> strong<00:02:19.390> magnets

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
come out but relative strong magnets

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.780 
come out but relative strong magnets
which<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> nice<00:02:20.320> for<00:02:20.980> portability<00:02:21.670> it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
which is a nice for portability it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.700 
which is a nice for portability it's
also<00:02:21.940> one<00:02:22.720> thing<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.900> should<00:02:22.960> mention<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.560> well

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
also one thing I should mention as well

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.410 
also one thing I should mention as well
they<00:02:23.860> are<00:02:23.980> actually<00:02:24.370> extremely<00:02:24.820> light<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.390> a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
they are actually extremely light for a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870 
they are actually extremely light for a
metal<00:02:25.630> construction<00:02:26.370> they're<00:02:27.370> very<00:02:27.610> very

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
metal construction they're very very

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.670 
metal construction they're very very
light<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.870> quite<00:02:29.020> surprising<00:02:29.440> how<00:02:29.470> light

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
light it's quite surprising how light

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
they are actually you can hold this in

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.490 
they are actually you can hold this in
your<00:02:31.840> palm<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.110> hand

doesn't<00:02:34.000> register<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.720> weight<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.320> that's<00:02:35.440> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
doesn't register the weight so that's a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.560 
doesn't register the weight so that's a
great<00:02:35.740> great<00:02:35.800> feature<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.460> very<00:02:36.760> important

great great feature and very important

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.300 
great great feature and very important
for<00:02:37.690> portability<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:38.740> we<00:02:38.860> take<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.040> look<00:02:39.220> at

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
for portability so if we take a look at

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.220 
for portability so if we take a look at
the<00:02:39.370> build<00:02:39.550> quality<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.330> made<00:02:40.600> from<00:02:40.810> metal

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the build quality it is made from metal

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.620 
the build quality it is made from metal
as<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.220> said<00:02:42.460> it's<00:02:42.790> put<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> real<00:02:43.180> house<00:02:43.300> brush

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
as I said it's put a real house brush

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.360 
as I said it's put a real house brush
look<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.020> does<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> few<00:02:44.590> little<00:02:44.980> scratches

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
but nothing major they've definitely

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.880 
but nothing major they've definitely
been<00:02:46.720> built<00:02:47.050> with<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.440> potential

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890

green when it's charged enough we move

green when it's charged enough we move
on<00:03:11.230> top<00:03:11.500> here's<00:03:11.770> one<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.010> made<00:03:12.100> earlier<00:03:12.310> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
on top here's one I made earlier so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.820 
on top here's one I made earlier so
anyway<00:03:13.570> as<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.780> said<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.110> design<00:03:14.410> as<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> whole

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
anyway as I said the design as a whole

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.620 
anyway as I said the design as a whole
you've<00:03:15.010> got<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.220> speaker<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:15.670> top<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.210> then

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
you've got the speaker on top and then

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.240 
you've got the speaker on top and then
the<00:03:16.720> housing<00:03:17.170> around<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.650> metal<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
the housing around in the metal is a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.580 
the housing around in the metal is a
very<00:03:18.490> nice<00:03:18.670> clean<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.510> modern<00:03:19.600> design<00:03:19.840> really

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
very nice clean and modern design really

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.230 
very nice clean and modern design really
nice<00:03:20.800> um<00:03:20.950> compacting<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.640> definitely<00:03:22.210> a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
nice um compacting and definitely a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.270 
nice um compacting and definitely a
sweet<00:03:22.480> design<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:23.680> what<00:03:23.920> good<00:03:24.130> is

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
sweet design but you know what good is

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.370 
sweet design but you know what good is
great<00:03:24.550> design<00:03:24.880> without<00:03:25.510> sound<00:03:25.870> quality<00:03:26.260> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
great design without sound quality to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.110 
great design without sound quality to
match<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.950> let's<00:03:27.460> move<00:03:27.610> on<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> sound

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
match so let's move on to the sound

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880 
match so let's move on to the sound
quality<00:03:28.450> because<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.110> why<00:03:29.410> we're<00:03:29.740> all

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
quality because that is why we're all

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.830 
quality because that is why we're all
here<00:03:29.920> now<00:03:30.790> I'll<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.060> get<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.450> cabling

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
here now I'll just get the cabling

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.700 
here now I'll just get the cabling
because<00:03:32.050> I've<00:03:32.110> course<00:03:32.290> obviously<00:03:32.560> about<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
because I've course obviously about the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.620 
because I've course obviously about the
cable<00:03:32.950> not<00:03:33.460> very<00:03:33.640> interesting<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.120> cable<00:03:34.480> but

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
cable not very interesting in cable but

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.420 
cable not very interesting in cable but
I<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:34.960> straight<00:03:35.230> about<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.470> cable<00:03:35.800> one

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
I have so straight about the cable one

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.010 
I have so straight about the cable one
thing<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.730> would<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:36.970> liked<00:03:37.240> on<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.630> cable<00:03:37.930> if

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
thing I would have liked on the cable if

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.480 
thing I would have liked on the cable if
I<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.290> untangle<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:39.040> slightly<00:03:39.400> the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
I just untangle it slightly the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.090 
I just untangle it slightly the

sound<00:06:33.680> quality<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:34.130> these<00:06:34.220> speakers<00:06:34.580> is

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
sound quality of these speakers is

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.920 
sound quality of these speakers is
actually<00:06:35.000> pretty<00:06:35.150> good<00:06:35.360> for<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.690> price

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
actually pretty good for the price

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.720 
actually pretty good for the price
they're<00:06:36.320> they're<00:06:36.500> more<00:06:36.680> than<00:06:36.830> worth<00:06:37.010> it<00:06:37.220> at<00:06:37.670> a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
they're they're more than worth it at a

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.280 
they're they're more than worth it at a
hundred<00:06:37.940> percent<00:06:38.090> volumes<00:06:38.660> things<00:06:38.900> do<00:06:39.140> get

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
hundred percent volumes things do get

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.410 
hundred percent volumes things do get
tend<00:06:39.740> to<00:06:39.830> be<00:06:39.920> a<00:06:39.950> little<00:06:40.130> bit<00:06:40.280> scratchy<00:06:40.580> so<00:06:41.270> it's

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
tend to be a little bit scratchy so it's

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.940 
tend to be a little bit scratchy so it's
just<00:06:41.750> suggest<00:06:42.020> around<00:06:42.260> eighty<00:06:42.410> to<00:06:42.590> ninety

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
just suggest around eighty to ninety

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.940 
just suggest around eighty to ninety
percent<00:06:42.980> volume<00:06:43.490> is<00:06:43.790> ideal<00:06:44.180> but<00:06:44.750> on<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.770> whole

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
percent volume is ideal but on the whole

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.560 
percent volume is ideal but on the whole
this<00:06:46.310> is<00:06:46.370> a<00:06:46.430> great<00:06:46.670> little<00:06:46.850> budget<00:06:47.120> set<00:06:47.480> of

this is a great little budget set of
