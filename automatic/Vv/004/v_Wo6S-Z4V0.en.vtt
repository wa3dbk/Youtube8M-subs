00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.289
 hi comrades how are you and we are 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.370
 here in the top 5 gadgets for 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.880
 most useless infantry of butterfield 4 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.230
 warning 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.700
 the mega video that you are going to see 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.950
 below is a personal opinion 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.949
 about the useless gadgets for the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.570
 infantry draw of 4 and starting with 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.550
 down in the 5th position dyno utility 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.339
 we have not an accessory but a 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.710
 grenade grenade grenade this grenade 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.269
 consider one of the most useless wools 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.640
 of the game not to say the most useless 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.860
 because we can only carry a single 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 grenade of this type and exerts damage by 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 time is to say it does not make a bang 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 that does an instant damage but that 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.570
 makes a cloud of fire that is going 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.790
 burning little by little and little by little we 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.310
 It is hurting considering 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.050
 we can escape from this cloud easily 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.450
 should cause considerable damage 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.610
 if we stay in the cloud but the most 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.410
 funny is that if we stay in the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 cloud since it explodes until 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 disappears in the cloud we are only exercised 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.180
 90 damage points what the hell are you going for? 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.330
 here part with this grenade and the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.170
 granada m-67 can kill you instantly 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 it does not make any sense 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.350
 and in position 4 of uselessness it 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.180
 find the m 320 shotgun yes sir 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.159
 this special cartridge of the lancer nothing 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.320
 it gets 120 that turns this 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.170
 grenade launcher in a powerful shotgun 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.240
 a single shot if its damage to short 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.700
 distances is greater than a shotgun 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.220
 sliding but seriously compensates 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.159
 spend a slot of an accessory for 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.020
 this crap of a single shot 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.360
 someone uses it please let me in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.610
 comments and now yes entering the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.380
 podium of futility of peace of the end in the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.270
 put 3 we found the incredible 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.520
 ucap that it is a missile 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 remote-controlled television you can 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.080
 throw anywhere in heaven 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.299
 open and inflicting infantry with a 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.880
 only impact up here all right not 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.880
 it seems like a checada but that the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.280
 problem there is good first of all not 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.709
 it goes so far and secondly it is 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.619
 we have to wait 50 seconds 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.500
 to throw another one a savage so that 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.450
 you're going to take this by occupying a slot 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.640
 accessories when you can take another 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 something more useful as for example 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.570
 a mortar 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.970
 of silver because everything is for the accessory 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.970
 for the brother recognition class 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.410
 of place the swap the south is no longer a 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.540
 small plane with which we can mark 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.910
 objectives not to do for almost 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.430
 partners with the jable and they can do 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.540
 laser-designated attacks so far 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.820
 everything well does not seem like a tool 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.350
 perfect to encourage the game in 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.570
 team in the recognition class 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.770
 but the problem is that it is well cited 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.810
 it lasts 30 seconds 30 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.720
 seconds besides that it's pretty 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.880
 cumbersome fix goals with laser in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.950
 the air we can only use 30 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 seconds and after that it explodes and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.650
 disappears and we have to wait for others 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.060
 30 seconds to recharge 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.890
 recharge if we have a box 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.290
 of ammunition next door because we can only 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.140
 take one until you can catch another one 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.790
 a box of ammunition not these two 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.830
 details in which this contraption is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.470
 deserves to be one of the most useless 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.570
 discussions of the 4th you have seen someone 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.750
 use it and I do not mean those that are 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.580
 devote to trolling with this contraption 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.480
 trying to run over but do not use 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.769
 someone truly to fix 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.299
 by laser good good and here is 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.730
 difficult the truth choose the winner with 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.299
 a podium so tight of gadgets 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.739
 useless but here we have the winner on 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.840
 amazing and fantastic mp / ap is this 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.730
 Gadget is supposed to create a barrier 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.890
 of electronic countermeasures that makes 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 exploit all the projectiles that 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.750
 have explosives that try to pass 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.340
 this barrier is supposed to be 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.620
 Gadget is designed to help 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.890
 the allied tanks or protect us from 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.019
 rocket launchers or explosives is assumed by 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.049
 what in addition to this barrier of action 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.420
 not very well and 7 meters long each time 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.370
 that receives a projectile goes to a state 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.920
 of discharge of about 2 seconds 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.200
 approximately where you can continue 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.200
 stopping explosives but after passing 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.299
 that phase needs to be recharged and it takes 5 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.459
 seconds to do it in those five 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.380
 seconds any explosive can pass 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.090
 the barrier plus this contraption you 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.100
 you can charge with normal bullets or 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.560
 just throwing a grenade at him 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.540
 someone from this planet 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.090
 useful battlefield 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.740
 to this shit please leave it on 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.960
 the comments because the truth is that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.750
 I would be very curious to know how 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 use this shit and well this is all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.790
 comrades and I remind you that this is a 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.130
 personal opinion and I encourage you to put 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.620
 and without comments your top 5 of 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.680
 useless gadgets for the infantry 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.260
 in comments I would like to know which 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.690
 are yours and we can certainly 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.460
 get to 50 likes with this video to see 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.880
 yes we can until the next video 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.880
 comrades
