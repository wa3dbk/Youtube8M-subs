00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
with a copy of a safe erase so you can

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
with a copy of a safe erase so you can
completely<00:01:42.450> scrub<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> annihilate

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
completely scrub and annihilate
everything<00:01:43.649> left<00:01:43.950> behind<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> old

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
everything left behind on the old

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
everything left behind on the old
machine<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.020> has<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> sync<00:01:46.560> package

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
machine and it also has a sync package

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.109 
machine and it also has a sync package
so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.340> move<00:01:47.460> forward<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.030> new

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so you can move forward with your new

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
so you can move forward with your new
machine<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> keep<00:01:48.600> everything<00:01:48.930> coordinated

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
machine to keep everything coordinated

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
machine to keep everything coordinated
there's<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> great<00:01:50.700> idea<00:01:50.909> also<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> nice<00:01:51.600> little

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
there's a great idea also a nice little

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
there's a great idea also a nice little
thing<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.520> PT<00:01:53.520> mover<00:01:53.850> has<00:01:54.090> done<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
thing that the PT mover has done a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
thing that the PT mover has done a
rather<00:01:54.540> lap<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.049> they've<00:01:55.380> come<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.740> with

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
rather lap like they've come out with

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
rather lap like they've come out with
another<00:01:56.189> version<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.119> software<00:01:57.509> package

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
another version of the software package

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.499 
another version of the software package
called<00:01:58.110> PC<00:01:58.890> relocator<00:01:59.490> which<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> only<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
called PC relocator which is only the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.050 
called PC relocator which is only the
the<00:02:00.840> cable<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> mover<00:02:02.670> software

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the cable and the and the mover software

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730 
the cable and the and the mover software
doesn't<00:02:03.329> come<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> described<00:02:04.259> software

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
doesn't come with the described software

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.499 
doesn't come with the described software
or<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> synchronizer<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
or the synchronizer so that's the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
or the synchronizer so that's the
difference<00:02:06.659> between<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.229> $50<00:02:07.649> package<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
difference between the $50 package and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.230 
difference between the $50 package and
the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.970 
the
or<00:02:09.420> package<00:02:09.780> anyways<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.620> want<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:10.890> more

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
or package anyways if you want some more

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.680 
or package anyways if you want some more
information<00:02:11.190> come<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.240> Micro<00:02:12.480> Center

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
information come on down to Micro Center

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.410 
information come on down to Micro Center
thanks<00:02:12.960> for<00:02:13.080> watching
