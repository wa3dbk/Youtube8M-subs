00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 very good guys here we are in another 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.900
 site over watts 2,600 our 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.900
 screens and 32 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 positive because in this case I bring you 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.690
 had mystery and stress were committed 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.340
 reference and model but tell you that if 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 you give me a somewhat strange voice is that I 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.919
 has had seville a cold that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 flipas but good here I am commenting 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.949
 how can I and how do I say if I 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 you listen to something weird because that's why 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.800
 ok and look look at this little horse that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.050
 peak this movement is so extremely 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.669
 nice has new codes I bring a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.380
 new a new reference to which 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 we can find justly forgiveness in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 this location up here of all the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 map of chicago is worth right here in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.270
 kind of has appointment so here we can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 find one has a reference in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 this game and as I say they are 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 just up to the left of everything 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 the map is worth just here and good 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 as I say here a kind of store the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.860
 which is called the version of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 quite rare and it has two species here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 of wooden bears at the entrance and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.740
 It seemed quite shocking and good to see 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.740
 as we enter right here in and 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.120
 just inside the boat inside the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.100
 from the bar counter we can 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 find a reference to one of the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 rayman rabbits rabbids rabbids what 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.050
 it was called the game and well then good 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.760
 if we give the box then 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.310
 start laughing because as you know 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.780
 this game was about sexually very 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.550
 well what it was about but it was a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 species of mutant rabbits which 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.930
 I already wanted to say how to empower saying 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.130
 of the earth and then there is a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 kind of doll that has to do 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.850
 different missions and such to finish 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.110
 with these mutant rabbits not for 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.730
 say migrations we leave the picture 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.990
 pressed and we take it out because it starts to 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.730
 laugh with red eyes in plan 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.950
 diabolical and the truth and as I say is 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.950
 quite pretty funny and sub-16 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.720
 and as I say the references 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.430
 you do not know and it's I do not know how to pronounce it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.850
 and as I say this rayman game 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.650
 raving rabbids because it's the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.270
 ubisoft developers obviously from 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.370
 the same as Washington since 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.110
 obviously you can not put references to 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.400
 other video games so clear that they were 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.470
 from another developer without supervision 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.399
 so this has been the reference or 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.440
 belief in this issue and we exploit more 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.420
 acting I think it's going to be more epic 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.069
 here I say goodbye with this one 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.750
 spirit or the shotgun so to call it 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.750
 this track is pretty cool 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.770
 two
