00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
memory card reader slot here on the left

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.680 
memory card reader slot here on the left
side<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.980> watch<00:02:44.980> events<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.510> can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
side we have the watch events as you can

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.970 
side we have the watch events as you can
see<00:02:46.840> there's<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.920> HDMI<00:02:48.610> port<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.090> two<00:02:49.989> USB<00:02:50.560> 3.0

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
see there's a HDMI port here two USB 3.0

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
see there's a HDMI port here two USB 3.0
ports<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.930> microphone<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.370> headphone<00:02:54.370> jack

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
ports a microphone and headphone jack

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.979 
ports a microphone and headphone jack
this<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.959> guess<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.560> power<00:02:56.950> outlet<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
this I guess is the power outlet the

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.140 
this I guess is the power outlet the
back<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.709> pretty<00:03:02.770> much<00:03:03.220> bare<00:03:03.550> as<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.030> see

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
back is pretty much bare as you can see

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.199 
back is pretty much bare as you can see
this<00:03:04.300> mooting<00:03:04.600> at<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:04.959> except<00:03:05.380> for<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
this mooting at the back except for the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.620 
this mooting at the back except for the
hinges<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:09.160> let's<00:03:09.580> go<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.880> right<00:03:10.030> side<00:03:10.390> we

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
hinges now let's go to the right side we

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.210 
hinges now let's go to the right side we
have<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.310> optical<00:03:12.520> right<00:03:12.970> here<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.800> there<00:03:15.040> we

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
have the optical right here and there we

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.410 
have the optical right here and there we
have<00:03:15.459> two<00:03:16.030> more<00:03:16.209> USB<00:03:16.390> 3.0<00:03:17.170> ports<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:19.180> is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
have two more USB 3.0 ports and this is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.520 
have two more USB 3.0 ports and this is
the<00:03:19.660> Raja<00:03:20.530> 45

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.600 

this<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.730> Kensington<00:03:25.910> lock<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:28.280> that's

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
this is the Kensington lock and that's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
this is the Kensington lock and that's
pretty<00:03:29.360> much<00:03:29.480> about<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:31.280> boat<00:03:31.520> try<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.300> open

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
pretty much about the boat try to open

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:47.920 
pretty much about the boat try to open
this<00:03:32.780> now<00:03:34.270> maybe<00:03:35.270> for<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.600> first<00:03:35.630> time

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.640 

very<00:03:48.500> shiny<00:03:48.830> agency

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.429 

so<00:03:56.239> this<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.189> parent<00:03:59.189> 14r<00:03:59.999> and<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.170> comes

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
so this is the parent 14r and this comes

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.410 
so this is the parent 14r and this comes
