a little bit about gum disease I brought

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.060 
a little bit about gum disease I brought
a<00:00:22.289> model<00:00:23.070> here<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:24.119> happens<00:00:24.800> reason<00:00:25.800> why<00:00:25.890> we

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
a model here what happens reason why we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.150 
a model here what happens reason why we
care<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.840> gum<00:00:27.840> disease<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.830> leading<00:00:28.859> cause

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
statistic is seventy five percent of the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
statistic is seventy five percent of the
people<00:00:35.040> over<00:00:35.340> age<00:00:35.850> 35<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> American

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
people over age 35 to American

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.549 
people over age 35 to American
population<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.309> form<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.879> gum<00:00:39.120> disease

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
population have some form of gum disease

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
population have some form of gum disease
so<00:00:40.559> let<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:40.770> show<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.370> detrimental

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so let me show you the detrimental

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
so let me show you the detrimental
effects<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.719> gum<00:00:42.930> disease<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.800> model<00:00:44.190> here

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
effects of gum disease and a model here

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
effects of gum disease and a model here
so<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.200> deal<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
so basically this deal right here is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
so basically this deal right here is
showing<00:00:47.250> us<00:00:47.899> gum<00:00:48.899> disease<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.230> its<00:00:49.559> effects

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
showing us gum disease and its effects

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
showing us gum disease and its effects
so<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.730> teeth<00:00:50.940> become<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.570> loose<00:00:51.750> there's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so the teeth become really loose there's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
so the teeth become really loose there's
no<00:00:52.469> bone<00:00:52.739> left<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> support<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> tooth<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
no bone left to support the tooth you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
no bone left to support the tooth you
can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> bone<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.500> lost<00:00:55.739> also<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.309> see

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
can see the bone is lost also you see

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.349 
can see the bone is lost also you see
kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> yucky<00:00:57.899> brown<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
kind of this yucky brown that's a

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.470 
kind of this yucky brown that's a
representation<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.840> tartar<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.480> what

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
representation of tartar and that's what

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
representation of tartar and that's what
often<00:01:04.110> happens<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.799> gum<00:01:05.040> disease<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.640> what

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
often happens with gum disease so what

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
often happens with gum disease so what
we<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> combat<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.560> here's<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> game

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
we do to combat that and here's the game

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
we do to combat that and here's the game
changer<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:09.930> called<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
changer we use this thing called a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
changer we use this thing called a
Reston<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.729> simply<00:01:12.180> gets<00:01:12.659> closed<00:01:13.020> up

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
Reston and it simply gets closed up

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.249 
Reston and it simply gets closed up
there<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.710> I'll<00:01:13.890> show<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
there and I'll show you actually the the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
there and I'll show you actually the the
magic<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
magic of all of it right there that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
magic of all of it right there that
yellow<00:01:18.780> tip<00:01:19.080> that's<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:20.280> menno<00:01:20.580> cyclin

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
yellow tip that's actually menno cyclin

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.109 
yellow tip that's actually menno cyclin
it's<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.869> common<00:01:22.320> antibiotic<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's just a very common antibiotic in a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's just a very common antibiotic in a
powder<00:01:24.360> form<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.340> take<00:01:26.490> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
powder form what we do is we take this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
powder form what we do is we take this
antibiotic<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.619> place<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.159> under<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> gum

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
antibiotic and we place it under the gum

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.749 
antibiotic and we place it under the gum
line<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.150> an<00:01:30.390> injection<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.350> just

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
line it's not an injection it just

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.560 
line it's not an injection it just
actually<00:01:32.759> show<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.509> here

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
actually show you right here

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
actually show you right here
demonstration<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.290> goes<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:35.130> up

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
demonstration it goes right up

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
demonstration it goes right up
underneath<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> gum<00:01:36.090> line<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:37.049> able

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
underneath the gum line and we're able

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
underneath the gum line and we're able
to<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> express<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to kind of express that or put that in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
to kind of express that or put that in
the<00:01:39.270> depth<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> pocket<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.369> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the depth of that pocket and that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
the depth of that pocket and that
attacks<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.740> bacterial<00:01:43.740> infection<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
attacks the bacterial infection at the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.260 
attacks the bacterial infection at the
heart<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> source<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.590> oftentimes<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:48.240> can

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
heart of the source so oftentimes we can

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.810 
heart of the source so oftentimes we can
say<00:01:48.600> people<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.140> having<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.680> through

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
say people from having to go through

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.569 
say people from having to go through
