00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
so much like Gras last year the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.360 
so much like Gras last year the
single-player<00:00:16.750> campaign<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.800> pretty<00:00:17.830> solid

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.370 
single-player campaign is pretty solid

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.510 
single-player campaign is pretty solid
it's<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.120> medium<00:00:19.510> to<00:00:19.810> short<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.770> length<00:00:20.830> about

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
it's a medium to short in length about

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's a medium to short in length about
eight<00:00:21.760> hours<00:00:21.970> depending<00:00:22.510> on<00:00:22.540> how<00:00:22.690> good<00:00:22.840> you

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
eight hours depending on how good you

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.630 
eight hours depending on how good you
are<00:00:23.140> there<00:00:23.590> are<00:00:23.710> three<00:00:23.920> levels<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.250> difficulty

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
are there are three levels of difficulty

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.130 
are there are three levels of difficulty
and<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:25.030> recommend<00:00:25.360> playing<00:00:25.720> through<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:25.960> medium

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
and I recommend playing through a medium

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.390 
and I recommend playing through a medium
and<00:00:26.410> then<00:00:26.500> going<00:00:26.650> back<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.040> playing<00:00:27.100> through

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
and then going back and playing through

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.540 
and then going back and playing through
it<00:00:27.430> are<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:29.590> you're<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.890> get<00:00:30.040> is<00:00:30.310> a

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550

system<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.049> same<00:03:21.260> way<00:03:21.439> you<00:03:21.920> can't<00:03:22.220> always

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
system in the same way you can't always

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.879 
system in the same way you can't always
go<00:03:23.359> through<00:03:23.629> bushes<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.439> things<00:03:24.470> like<00:03:24.829> that

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
go through bushes and things like that

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.099 
go through bushes and things like that
so<00:03:25.700> you're<00:03:26.030> really<00:03:26.209> losing<00:03:26.510> some<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:26.989> the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
so you're really losing some of the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
campaign which kind of takes away from

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.309 
campaign which kind of takes away from
the<00:03:29.870> whole<00:03:30.049> ghost<00:03:30.620> feel<00:03:31.689> finally<00:03:32.689> the<00:03:32.959> sound

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
that but everything that they did the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.119 
that but everything that they did the
first<00:04:11.449> time<00:04:11.720> they've<00:04:12.229> made<00:04:12.530> better<00:04:12.829> this<00:04:13.069> time

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
first time they've made better this time

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.920 
first time they've made better this time
they've<00:04:13.549> made<00:04:13.579> things<00:04:14.030> more<00:04:14.180> efficient<00:04:14.629> it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
they've made things more efficient it

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.779 
they've made things more efficient it
made<00:04:15.260> things<00:04:15.409> better<00:04:15.650> looking<00:04:16.099> they<00:04:16.489> had<00:04:16.760> a

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
made things better looking they had a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.189 
made things better looking they had a
lot<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:16.970> features<00:04:17.329> they<00:04:17.510> wanted<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.930> add<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
lot of features they wanted to add the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.710 
lot of features they wanted to add the
first<00:04:18.409> time<00:04:18.590> around<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.760> it's<00:04:20.479> one<00:04:20.630> of

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
first time around and so it's one of

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.899 
first time around and so it's one of
those<00:04:20.840> classic<00:04:21.019> sequels<00:04:21.709> it's<00:04:22.280> not<00:04:22.610> going<00:04:22.789> to

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
those classic sequels it's not going to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.370 
those classic sequels it's not going to
not<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.570> blow<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.930> away<00:04:24.020> from<00:04:24.289> the

not going to blow you away from the
first<00:04:24.560> one<00:04:24.830> that's<00:04:25.280> going<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.520> give<00:04:25.639> you

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
first one that's going to give you

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.860 
first one that's going to give you
everything<00:04:25.849> that<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.240> liked<00:04:26.479> in<00:04:26.599> the<00:04:26.659> first

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
everything that you liked in the first

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870 
everything that you liked in the first
one<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.229> more<00:04:27.590> some<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.400> problems<00:04:28.610> have

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
one and more some of the problems have

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.029 
one and more some of the problems have
been<00:04:28.909> solved<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:29.539> I<00:04:30.229> would<00:04:30.680> say<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.949> the

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
been solved and I would say that the

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.279 
been solved and I would say that the
co-op's<00:04:31.699> even<00:04:32.060> meteor<00:04:32.449> and<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.750> multiplayer

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
co-op's even meteor and the multiplayer

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.050 
co-op's even meteor and the multiplayer
is<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.590> as<00:04:33.710> good<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.280> fact<00:04:34.430> even<00:04:34.580> better<00:04:34.880> this

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
is just as good in fact even better this

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.300 
is just as good in fact even better this
time<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.599> I<00:04:36.169> think<00:04:36.260> for<00:04:36.979> anyone<00:04:37.190> looking

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
time and I think for anyone looking

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.879 
time and I think for anyone looking
forward<00:04:37.909> to<00:04:38.060> more<00:04:38.510> of<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.750> same<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.650> just

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
forward to more of the same but just

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.920 
forward to more of the same but just
slightly<00:04:40.280> better<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.690> what<00:04:41.810> you're

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
slightly better this is what you're

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.080 
slightly better this is what you're
going<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.110> get<00:04:42.229> with<00:04:42.409> bra<00:04:42.800> too

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
going to get with bra too

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.150 
going to get with bra too
