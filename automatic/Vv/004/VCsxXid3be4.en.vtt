 top sport center of rotterdam tpp in rotterdam against fc marlène closeup.nl 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.490
 international 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.129
 peter rozebeke the keeper of fc marlène prepares himself and also that scan that he 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.919
 the more does that on the side of rotterdam 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.849
 the numbers six and five face each other in the honorary indoor football division 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.089
 audience is ready 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.579
 two teams who lost a game in the Premier League last week 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.449
 and so an important period of time has come to make the message not top four 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.150
 the teacher taking over fc marlène 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.340
 it looks like a very good attack containing ice floes 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.040
 from rooy huisman 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.180
 and that scan that he the anteater temporarily grab the ball 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.150
 the first skirmishes in this competition 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.500
 and lyrical pereira again 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.970
 who immediately takes the lead for his team tpp that the three games 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.420
 lost in a row and there is the opening goal 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.660
 So it is nagging profit to Arcadis taking the hit 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.030
 for tpp rotterdam 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 that is the teams of the old goalkeeper car 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.910
 ahead 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.350
 fc marlène realizes that cycling has to do back two teams that are very close 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 incomplete and a very nice shot with a good save 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.370
 roozenbeek 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.460
 million worked with the chance to come to 2 0 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.920
 ponte drove football from fc marlène and bijstra shot the ball over 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 a very nice opportunity 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.870
 for fc marlène closeup.nl 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.440
 but it remains I want for the home team 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.890
 that concentrated football field that the council is replaying 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.660
 it is also the new fc marlène 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.460
 it is not then 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.930
 well done we are leistra she has no room for a shot 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 it is fine 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.860
 maingain and sarah and eggs decide to shoot education 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.619
 and then it does hit 3d 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.039
 in this way the team of kenneth goudmijn could return to the race 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 fc marlène rovers lost another away game this season 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.470
 on new highly concentrated football with an equally beautiful shot from a distance 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.150
 and finally 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.300
 but they are standing 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.269
 near the ant 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.139
 who gets injured 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.319
 we stand with the chance that two ing 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.069
 five minutes before rest 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.069
 fc marlène gert ariane falls on the right again 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:25.039
 good action of the wasp if there is peacock strong and there is 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.069
 the cross 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.109
 and then it's hit 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.999
 blizzard animals coveted lead for rc marlène is the goal of sofie 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.559
 whether or not 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.489
 great lead 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.530
 wdp try to give something back with the natural figurehead of the teams 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.849
 happier pereira 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.849
 but that didn't work out just before the break 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.499
 unfortunately fc marlène takes the lead 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.429
 the number five in the indoor football league 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.029
 it is not the first minute of the second half 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.279
 with marian the base 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.879
 and he gets the ball back 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.359
 the team of kenneth goudmijn excellently took the lead 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.739
 it is a triplet there is to be sported at a wonderful moments 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.479
 at that moment after the break this is a very important goal and again it was then 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 not 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.659
 margin of two goals difference this was pitched as with a good cross and 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.679
 rate shoots the ball on the post 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:26.119
 what an enormous opportunity for fc marlène to expand that lead even further 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.739
 can not lose the ball at the ps as the chickens but still it is 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.009
 suddenly a modern one 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.000
 that ball loss 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.399
 good pass from zakaria 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.329
 it brings the tension back to the match she lives here he makes it 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.989
 connection goal 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.839
 in the top sports center in Rotterdam 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.819
 with a nice applause from the audience 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.859
 he is sitting 2 3 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.859
 give the visitors a head start 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.849
 babysitting is not blown yet is almost the 3 3 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.339
 it's her career 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.519
 which almost benefits from the loss of the ball 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.719
 from ensign mannnen 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.149
 beautiful staircase of type roozenbeek 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.149
 but we find the forests it only got it 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.689
 it all started with the keeper of fc marlène 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.349
 And FC Marlène wants more here in Rotterdam that feels pretty good 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.440
 to show the result 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.060
 and look at is 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.650
 the scan that he is the animals 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.870
 bypassed 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.510
 and is choosing anp and za this is the second makes in this match and made 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.099
 dwm and now also the 4 2 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.400
 in Rotterdam 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.520
 then the ttp something back, or at least it tries to do something back via the boeljon 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.309
 zoom 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:34.840
 and that doesn't happen 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.120
 the going towards the end of the game the disappointment of course 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.699
 thereby on barbat 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.740
 it is the fourth defeat in a row that is now certain 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.500
 the long ball of dennis forest and there is unfortunately weistra 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.120
 with the 5 2 in 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.650
 rotterdam for fc marlène a nice final chord for what we stand for 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.789
 team from heerhugowaard a nice victory 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:56.459
