00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 this is quite difficult I think everything 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.000
 the world is giving the maximum and doing 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.289
 things in the best way in a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 Strong but pretty healthy competition 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.280
 you try to give your best and do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.280
 things well and good and then 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.009
 the most difficult decision is the people 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.670
 technical because we all treat 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.220
 to put it hard look good I feel 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.829
 Really happy that there 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.040
 the trainings are quite strong but 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.239
 but very good because personally 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.160
 as you say were things I needed 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.960
 and I'm trying to go 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.940
 grabbing them from this week is pretty 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.430
 I feel better and that's the best 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.030
 important is always nice 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.160
 It represents your country and after 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 the things that I have lived I think this 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.869
 is something that is not explained and that one does not 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.380
 wants to leave it to the one who leaves so 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.200
 easy there's no doubt because I think my 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.330
 I had better physical condition when 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.509
 I was in Caracas and it was with the same 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.990
 coaching staff right now the jobs 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.690
 they are pretty similar and then over there 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.060
 it costs me at the beginning for so long 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.470
 that was not dragging this kind of 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.660
 things but 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.640
 but but there's going if it's a group 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.800
 quite difficult is not only Brazil 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.470
 also colombia is the same but in the 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.190
 friendly that we were this was a 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 difficult match we saw a lot 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.609
 even 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 and beyond that they also 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.000
 players were missing the best we 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.150
 also in physical states they were not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.430
 the same 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.900
 and many things that can be related 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 with respect to what the 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.280
 matches but I think with what 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.620
 we have been working, I think that beyond 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.030
 We want to worry about it 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 they will also worry about 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.430
 us and we think more about what 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.060
 we are and what we know that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.729
 we can give and all that goes on the basis of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.350
 work and good as I told you before 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.140
 is doing that and it is working 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.000
 pretty strong looking is true that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.510
 the most important thing is that good 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.010
 we can do something here in ixtac or to 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.870
 improve what could have been done before 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.989
 obviously one always has to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.140
 think big and then things 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.180
 staff that comes to study it 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.180
 think about it and make the best decision
