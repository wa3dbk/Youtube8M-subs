00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
first around and pretend that it's an

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
first around and pretend that it's an
Alec<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.359> doing<00:00:27.510> anything

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
against another fairy dragon and also it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
against another fairy dragon and also it
has<00:00:43.200> two<00:00:43.559> attacks<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.489> strong<00:00:44.969> against

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
do moon fire and then I'm gonna start
building<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.789> my<00:00:50.940> arcane<00:00:51.360> blast<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
building up my arcane blast and it's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
building up my arcane blast and it's
really<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> build<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
really good if you can build up the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.350 
really good if you can build up the
arcane<00:00:54.690> blast<00:00:55.100> will<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.180> means

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
arcane blast will because that means

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
arcane blast will because that means
that<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:57.989> Darwin<00:00:58.379> comes<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> will

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that when Darwin comes in and you will

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.280 
that when Darwin comes in and you will
all<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.890> some<00:01:03.110> some<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
cellphone was running with a complicated

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.679 
cellphone was running with a complicated
emulate<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.890> done<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.570> want<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.869> do

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
emulate and done and you want to do

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.179 
emulate and done and you want to do
emulate<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.250> complicate<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:42.560> gonna<00:01:42.799> do

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
emulate and complicate so just gonna do

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.899 
emulate and complicate so just gonna do
a<00:01:43.429> emulator<00:01:44.390> first<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.350> make<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.979> MA<00:01:46.399> /<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
a emulator first to make the MA / and

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.260 
a emulator first to make the MA / and
then<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:48.020> gonna<00:01:48.229> follow<00:01:48.500> up<00:01:48.679> with<00:01:48.710> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
then I'm gonna follow up with a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.120 
then I'm gonna follow up with a
confident<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.960> can<00:01:51.079> see<00:01:51.229> he's<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.500> really

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
confident and you can see he's a really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.090 
confident and you can see he's a really
low<00:01:52.429> health<00:01:52.670> already<00:01:53.030> because<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.100> route

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
low health already because of the route

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.279 
low health already because of the route
thing<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.030> he<00:01:56.119> does<00:01:56.299> was<00:01:56.569> called<00:01:56.929> entangling

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
thing that he does was called entangling

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.609 
thing that he does was called entangling
roots<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.729> fine<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.270> because<00:01:59.899> all<00:02:00.470> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
roots but it's fine and because all the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.800 
roots but it's fine and because all the
other<00:02:00.740> texts<00:02:01.189> are<00:02:01.340> weak<00:02:01.700> against<00:02:02.000> him<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.360> it's

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
other texts are weak against him so it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.899 
other texts are weak against him so it's
not<00:02:03.259> no<00:02:03.679> problem<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.130> all<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.429> I'm<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.759> gonna
