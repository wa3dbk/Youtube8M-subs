00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.919
 hi guys it's batistuta so we 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.870
 is today for the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.690
 third episode of my rivals all 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 according to my series abdou to sharon cherop 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 sea ​​fishing in both episodes 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.680
 previous I had done about 70 me of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.810
 benefit because I had not managed to 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.609
 acquire 30 players 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.189
 I did not acquire in the wines of the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.590
 twenty there again I bought 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.410
 20 June 22 players 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.140
 I think I've never been able to maybe 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.469
 that my budget too low to stay 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.790
 high risk to have global but 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.309
 to have money here is train of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.539
 oise simply knowing the fact 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.590
 per game on the players move so 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.980
 it's quite expensive it's minimum jimmy 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.840
 after there are big players like 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.350
 like for example the goal of dortmund the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.449
 watch facts their boosters 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 but good to do to make a 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.409
 maximum of profits to do it on 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.320
 things is very very big players the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.900
 kawa very very strong kagawa that I 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 advise to a lot of people to a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 middle center mcg not i have not removed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.340
 but in 1200 tr of aces and there is good 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.980
 even the view a square that I liked to 38 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 I bought it at 20 me I read my 30 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.780
 stack simply because they 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.410
 had they had a lot of contracts 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.120
 incidentally in previous episodes 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.330
 following episodes I will put you the 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.250
 customer contract standards 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.800
 I think I'm more if I do them 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.110
 there or not but I know that in the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.240
 following episodes I did them because 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:02.229
 that I already have two episodes ahead but 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 yes it must be done quickly for the pcci 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.430
 cr7 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.900
 on the other hand I have a doubt about its price I 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.100
 thought it was a million five hundred 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.350
 a thousand but I was watching this morning and I 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.040
 most seen was worth 1 million 800 thousand and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.000
 I think I think it's 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 because it was morning that's all 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.560
 raphael mouth you I have never tested 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.390
 but he looks very logical do not see 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.580
 the interest of putting 30 miles of lateral 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.930
 law 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 I say this but I bought daniel 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 alves poland that makes 5000 more 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.739
 yeah but here we are when you play 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.739
 also quite cheating in the game 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.230
 Moroccan labyad 4 and hodge and techniques 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.030
 81,50 speed really you make a 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 Moroccan team with life is Arab 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.450
 chouf ouchouf to el arabi and the world 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.820
 I wanted to make one but the problem 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.950
 it's defense a defense say that 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.080
 blessed to use the old 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.380
 Marseille, China 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380
 else 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.180
 there we will arrive soon at the end I 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.340
 think with them their that too I 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
 would never understand he has 82 general he 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.080
 is boosted costs more than the 84th 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.780
 general who is not boost I 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.540
 would never understand that it's like and 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
 chara wild he has a taste I put you there 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.440
 that I felt this more expensive listening 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.440
 than at lucas 81st 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 short 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.860
 and here are the last two players that 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.650
 on mbokani and borja valero tons this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.340
 which you saw there I bought I 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.050
 bought two tons 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.080
 after that I just bought 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.480
 many and not women's footsteps 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.120
 big players to more than 5 credit because 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.340
 that it is especially that it is on this kind 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.100
 player who did the most 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.580
 profits despite the very high tax 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.940
 had but it's going fast with 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.530
 players over 5000 kg 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.720
 that's why as soon as you have 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.459
 at least that's it but credit is going fast 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.520
 researcher at 21 2 2 so here are my 22 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.900
 players sold themselves and that makes me 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 451 1426 credit frankly I was 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.350
 quite happy because out of 22 players 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.810
 fans a profit of about 5000 credit 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.760
 it's very, very well 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:39.890
 about 5000 profit credit per share 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:41.600
 players so here's the animal age to 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.560
 around 500 me credit and there you 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.200
 see that it's going to be very, very 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.160
 quick 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.250
 there is nothing simpler about you 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.290
 let it make me weird it's over 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.840
 you can go up to 6 7 million 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.130
 quiet after if you want 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.530
 continue or continue here is a 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.700
 vocalist and the last player so 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.720
 I had 350 4625 radio start I'm 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.960
 found with 451 1426 credit at the end 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.150
 only a total gain of 96 1821 credit and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.840
 an average gain per player of 4400 credit 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.900
 sailing at 96 1821 believable by knowing 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.600
 knowing that 22 players 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.090
 so frankly I'm pretty happy 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.730
 of this episode 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.660
 now i'm going to have tried to have 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.640
