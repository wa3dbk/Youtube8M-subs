00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:10.050
 so haye to all the time i have in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.690
 last time ios 4.3 unlock 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.870
 or jailbreak procedure 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.369
 followed more closely and many of you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.670
 we jumped right on a jailbreak 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.850
 hoped an untethered jailbreak and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.560
 unlock and I have now too 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 I'm developing a little bit around myself 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.010
 Do and for a long time already 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.119
 jailbreaks and unlocks themselves 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.969
 Playing dubai play around 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.460
 I would like to publish now but 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.829
 just show my between town 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.510
 So you see here I have the version 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.190
 4.3 on it as the newest and me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 have now even unlock the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 which does not work yet 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 is suitable for mass 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.160
 I also work with the ipad 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.340
 baseband and now I'll just show you 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.260
 did not think that I would like you for apple 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.260
 have been here this works 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.820
 because I could use you normally 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 then I turn off and show you 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.050
 that is really an untethered one 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.050
 jailbreak 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.320
 be done so now 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.290
 takes a little longer than usual 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.060
 new we need to wait until the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.060
 have received 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.980
 searching what he is looking for network 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.879
 Now he has found his net and that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 problem with an unlock 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:28.300
 respectively untethered jailbreak of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.010
 ios 4.3 is not quite that 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140
 is suitable for mass because it still has everything 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.340
 is quite complicated and I the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.310
 If I really have that, then I'm afraid 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.709
 would publish that the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.750
 to shoot most of you your iphone 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.760
 I hope some attempts are needed 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.250
 is it really that worked like that 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.830
 you've seen this here now so I have 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.140
 of course, that will continue to develop 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.230
 and maybe we will see if I am 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.959
 the time one of the first or the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.329
 an untethered jailbreak respectively 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.120
 even start for the iphone 3g s 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.500
 So that is now in the iphone 3gs or 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.500
 of the iphone 4 released
