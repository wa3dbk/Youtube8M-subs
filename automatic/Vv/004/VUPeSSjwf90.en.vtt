00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.939
 today we are going to prepare broken eggs with 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 chorizo and the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.650
 use are 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 4 medium potatoes cut into stick 4 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.290
 eggs two sausages on a 2 2 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.490
 teaspoons of spicy sweet paprika 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.490
 virgin olive oil and salt 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.750
 warmed abundant olive oil 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.750
 a pan and fry all the potatoes 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.270
 It is important to use fresh potatoes and not 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.390
 those that come frozen because the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.880
 dish will not come out the same 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.470
 when they take a light golden color and 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.020
 the we can draw to avoid leaving 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.530
 crunchy we set them on a plate with 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 kitchen paper 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.470
 Once drained, we season to taste 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.310
 We divide the potatoes into two servings 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
 spreading the envelope on the bottom of a 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.640
 plate 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.050
 now fry the eggs taking advantage of the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.050
 hot potato skillet 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.800
 fry the eggs one by one until 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.750
 the white is white 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.240
 do not leave them long to the pan 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.580
 if you want the yolk to remain liquid and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.290
 Do not cook when the eggs are 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.290
 facts we put them on the potatoes 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.430
 We cut the chorizos in half to the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.430
 long 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.570
 we fry them on the grill 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.260
 we turn around 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.200
 and we squeeze them against the pan to 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.570
 that they do better 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.560
 once fried we add in half to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.560
 each side of the eggs 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 to finish we throw a little 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.090
 paprika above in our case 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.039
 we have used a little spicy just 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.270
 Before eating them, you should break the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.130
 eggs 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.440
 and it is ready and it is very easy and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.720
