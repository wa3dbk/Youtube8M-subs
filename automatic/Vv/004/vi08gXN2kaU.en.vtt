00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.610
 Hello, today's video, I'll show 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.639
 how easy it is to sew new shorts 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.799
 This method is suitable for beginners if 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.779
 you are interested then stay watch 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.329
 this video I will need a segment further 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.140
 fabric length 80 and width 100 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.930
 centimeters 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.410
 new shorts i will cut to old and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.540
 first fold the fabric in half 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.440
 get a rectangle with sides 50 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.810
 this is the width and 80 is the length we fold 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.230
 old shorts in half with the back 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.870
 up and chalk like shorts 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.780
 will be on the gum then side increased 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.240
 Antalya 5-10 centimeters and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.880
 top waist 5 centimeters for 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.780
 gum inserts and allowances on the bottom 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.150
 from the tanks then turn over the shorts 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.000
 the front part and also circled 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.309
 their chalk increasing quietly somewhat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 centimeters given the fact that the front 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.560
 part of the waist has a slight slope 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.510
 also leave 5 centimeters for insertion 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.330
 gum and allowances all cut and 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.530
 we should have four parts 2 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.409
 front and 2 rear 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.420
 On the overlock we connect 2 backs first 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.659
 parts on the center from seamy side 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.399
 together and then take the two front 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.399
 and also line up 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.000
 after that it remains to connect the side 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.229
 parts at the front and back side together 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.229
 also using overlockers 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.750
 and we also connect parts in the middle of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.750
 future shorts together 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 the last step is inserting a rubber band and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.020
 bottom processing 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.440
 shorts to start on overlock 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.479
 we process edges of a bottom and thinking 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.240
 cars are laying the line 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.730
 then we work from the top of her 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.040
 edges also process screw a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.500
 then bend a couple of centimeters with 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.560
 seamy side need it in order 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.350
 so that we can insert the tongue gum 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.810
 I insert with a pin pushing 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.150
 or forward stretching the fabric and holding 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.130
 one end after all 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
 I put the gum I will connect 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.880
 and two ends of it and sews up a place where 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.370
 exhibited this gum but that's all 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 simple shorts for summer ready now you 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.590
 also be able to sew yourself 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 such and if you're wondering how I will do 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.570
 Here is a pattern on the shorts then go 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.150

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.730
