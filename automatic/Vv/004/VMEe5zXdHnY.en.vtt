now this method is a bit harder than the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
now this method is a bit harder than the
usual<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.900> you're<00:01:10.080> new<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.470> try<00:01:10.979> the

usual way if you're new at this try the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
usual way if you're new at this try the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
videos instead of this one okay so once

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
videos instead of this one okay so once
you<00:01:17.040> fold<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.700> turn<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> its<00:01:18.390> side

you fold it up and turn it on its side
and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.990> firm<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.380> again<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and you firm it up again and then you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
and you firm it up again and then you
turn<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> its<00:01:20.790> side<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
turn it on its side one more time to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
turn it on its side one more time to
firm<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
firm it up one last time and this is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.929 
firm it up one last time and this is
done<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.360> nice<00:01:24.540> smooth

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
done so you get nice smooth

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
done so you get nice smooth
otherwise<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> looks<00:01:27.149> fit<00:01:27.539> squared<00:01:28.549> let's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
otherwise it looks fit squared let's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
otherwise it looks fit squared let's
flip<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.880> around<00:01:29.969> okay<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:30.929> now<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
flip them around okay so now you take a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.279 
flip them around okay so now you take a
sliced<00:01:31.859> avocado<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:33.509> slices<00:01:34.049> one

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
sliced avocado and you take slices one

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.200 
sliced avocado and you take slices one

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
1 being truffle now the reason for this

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.400 
1 being truffle now the reason for this
is<00:05:55.300> truffle<00:05:55.600> oil<00:05:55.630> is<00:05:55.750> very<00:05:55.780> strong<00:05:56.230> and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
is truffle oil is very strong and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.470 
is truffle oil is very strong and
pungent<00:05:56.620> so<00:05:57.040> I<00:05:57.070> don't<00:05:57.310> want<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.550> overwhelm<00:05:58.150> the
