sniper rifles and they shoot too fast

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.039 
sniper rifles and they shoot too fast
even<00:01:09.090> though<00:01:09.180> their<00:01:09.360> bolt<00:01:09.570> action<00:01:09.930> sniper

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
even though their bolt action sniper

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you that are both fully automatic but we

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
you that are both fully automatic but we
need<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> nerve<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> slow<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> fire<00:01:19.350> right

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
need to nerve and slow the fire right

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
need to nerve and slow the fire right
down<00:01:19.860> or<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> ballista<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> dsr<00:01:21.659> even<00:01:22.080> though

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
down or the ballista and dsr even though

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
down or the ballista and dsr even though
they're<00:01:22.350> already<00:01:22.740> bold<00:01:23.159> action<00:01:23.520> sniper

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
they're already bold action sniper

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
they're already bold action sniper
rifles<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> slowest<00:01:25.710> shooting<00:01:26.189> guns

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
rifles and are the slowest shooting guns

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
rifles and are the slowest shooting guns
in<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> game<00:01:27.380> yeah<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> makes<00:01:28.619> sense<00:01:28.829> we

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
in the game yeah it makes sense we

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.440 
in the game yeah it makes sense we
really<00:01:29.490> need<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> sell<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.210> when

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
really need to sell those down when

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.149 
really need to sell those down when
there's<00:01:30.570> Remington's<00:01:31.439> running<00:01:31.799> around<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
there's Remington's running around that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
there's Remington's running around that
shoot<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.729> point<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> gun<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.750> ground<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
shoot from point that gun to ground and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
shoot from point that gun to ground and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
target finder LMGs with no recoil yeah

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.240 
target finder LMGs with no recoil yeah
it<00:01:37.229> makes<00:01:37.350> sense<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it makes sense that you need to make the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.990 
it makes sense that you need to make the
slowest<00:01:38.729> shooting<00:01:39.000> guns<00:01:39.270> shoot<00:01:40.049> slower<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
slowest shooting guns shoot slower I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
slowest shooting guns shoot slower I
