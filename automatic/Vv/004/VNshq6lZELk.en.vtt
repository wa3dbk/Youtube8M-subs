 power and I am now in the customize 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.580
 menu in the fun of it is that there are three 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.530
 new models 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.379
 player models can be seen that is for 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 the cross the knot and the oards 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.239
 it's especially when you see the difference 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.120
 just keep an old one between simple 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.030
 troll or an old leaf r11 and then go 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.410
 back to the war so new churches 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.000
 model then you really do not know something 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.900
 looks so much nicer when you go 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.260
 buzzer and you take a look at it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.780
 face and still just that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.849
 recognizability cartoonish 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.849
 ball fight very cool 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.470

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.980
 trainer who has has a holy fire 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.330
 a bit fried it starts 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220
 really itching again old love 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.810
 does not rust in that regard mainly because 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.720
 you just go to the original world 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.360
 van de resort now returns to the orks there 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.590
 the timber has been since those three rts 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.330
 games from blizzard 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.010
 and from the first pc games where i really 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.900
 a lot of time has been spent and 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.610
 apart from the central role that the doctor 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.240
 take you of course have the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.490
 new already system from 90 to level 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.830

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.830
 to do in this fifth expension 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.120
 of the workshop and I have the idea that 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.989
 this is by no means pure this morning 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.989
 So 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.070
 strubbe cunt 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.400
 how stable 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:43.550
 no 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:45.800
 don't be busy in the tent remote from 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.930
 diablo iii reaper of souls 1 of the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.880
 major pillars of enlargement 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.289
 diablo iii 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.350
 I do not know what awaits me 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.490
 is a random jellies 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.229
 those tricks are behind and the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.729
 also generate the tufts and serve 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.110
 times different so you never know what 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.270
 you have to expect 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.970
 find a super cool addition to the van 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.380
 the gameplay is not just for people who 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.680
 air max lab hardcore that already speaks for language 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.620
 hr and see it is for everywhere 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.449
 anyone who has finished story mode you 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.639
 could be labeled from that sex 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.699
 you can add it your own this more for it 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.729
 people who finished a story but 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.699
 mighty claymore diablo iii and war over 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.550
 shorten the radio it's a dark retty script 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.919
 Here it is also that we have a critical point 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.479
 of of players that it might to 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.070
 just a little too cartoon that just a little too 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.889
 great german oh that's actually already 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.449
 fikkie comes those cathedral routines mine 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.130
 of course you have the crash and the crusade 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.310
 and the new class I think it's really one 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.020
 very cool class he radiates power from it 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.539
 is one it's a cool grabs the good 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.610
 I also vote lower 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.260
 farm that just says it all 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.150
 which has everything in control 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.430
 I think that's blister with this 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.090
 just very good new class 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.090
 introduces 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.169
 If I have to summarize this trip 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.080
 think that 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.479
 bliss has two titles in the oven 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.240
 stand that say a little more and the 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.169
 critical fans could board again 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.270
 to get 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.669
 people were missing or do not pair 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.340
 fit the front cover completely in the glasses 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.349
 universe too cheerful those little bears there 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.419
 too too too cute 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.159
 do not really fit with the or the world 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.659
 or warcraft was after come with 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.400
 warlords or draenor of course completely 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:46.599
 well it goes back to the roots 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.490
 of what what what was and is the same 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:50.590
 also applies a bit to reaper or 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.680
 souls which also includes a lot 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.779
 bottlenecks are being addressed now or that 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.090
 all is going to be enough 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.650
 that will have to prove itself as the 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.150
 March 25 game 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.219
 I'm really out of both games very 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.990
 I had a lot of fun now it's over 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:06.490
 dive into the language I'm going on my 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.050
 watch your movie on a laptop and then I am 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.110
 back in three and a half hours 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.110
 The Netherlands 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.600
 the 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.210
 hate
