00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.249
 First 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:48.349
 because for the standards issues of productivity is a fundamental issue 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.819
 to compete in global and national markets 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.489
 the second because it will mark a new milestone the turn of business in this matter 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.109
 given that the competition from Colombia on Colombia is increasingly based 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.119
 more than in difference is that the partners 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:11.229
 that way you can facilitate access to machinery points to the micro 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.169
 small and medium-sized companies in the sector and at the same time decrease 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.119
 significant gap productivity and competitiveness of fashion companies 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.909
 maybe I have 11 ene in the project is very important 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.669
 because this machine 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.269
 will bring modernization and technology for the entrepreneur 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.659
 and also increased its competitiveness Jorge Arancibia companies 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.249
 be more productive 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:43.909
 the 99 percent is to say more than 11 thousand two hundred companies of the textile cluster and 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.689
 tailoring design and fashion 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.859
 are small and medium-sized microphones according to data of this hero in 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.880
 antioquia more than half of these 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.100
 have an average investment in technology while a third 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.579
 part has state-of-the-art technology 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.299
 and the rest has outdated technology hence the importance of 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.669
 benefit from this service to be famous for being a technological service 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.970
 that goes for it 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.529
 deliver through all this alliance

 to employers in the textile and clothing sector 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.629
 is fundamental was a prisoner that we set to make the day 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.529
 why do not we have a lot of companies 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.340
 of the sector in order to cheat 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.720
 with a very big interest in this way its competitiveness of improvement of 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.660
 entity infrastructures in addition to its benefits in cutting the machine 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.610
 has advantages such as saving energy by consuming a quarter of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.889
 the energy that a suicide machine 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.599
 save time due to the possibility of cutting different amounts of 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.150
 pieces of simultaneous minor way wasted the possibility on the part of 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.960
 producers to estimate the costs of production ep the development of 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.680
 products 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.289
 making considerable hours of material 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.860
 since the fabric represents around 50% the total cost of the product 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.560
 we do not have around 30 thousand micro-enterprises per year, many of them from 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.129
 clothing sector 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.089
 in us through different strategies as head of marketing 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.879
 advertising calls for civilizations we achieve those with the 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.990
 who can access this service 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.400
 it is as well as thanks to the leadership of inexmoda in the framework of the project 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.270
 platform of innovation the commitment of scene of comfama the textile task 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.010
 and making and interacting 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.650
 small and medium entrepreneurs not only of antioquia but of other 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.340
 cities 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.970
 they will be able to access a service that will result in more cut garments 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.670
 professionals and of higher quality standing at the height of the great 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.599
 competitors 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.580
 also in this company does not currently have the cutting service 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.569
 automated 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.639
 really the idea interested us a lot because we all know that with 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.219
 the 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.099
 we can have another access to higher productivity at a better quality and 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.809
 better optimization of human resources and resources 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.960
 of consumption between products 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.380
 We thank the mayor of Milan and the Inter-American Development Bank 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.150
 for making this dream possible the dream of continuing to formalize the sector 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.460
 textile confection design and fashion in colombia
