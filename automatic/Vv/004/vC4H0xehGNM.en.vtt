00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.840 
person i have two more of these in the
cabinet<00:07:05.710> already<00:07:05.980> done<00:07:06.310> reason<00:07:06.580> I<00:07:06.640> got<00:07:06.790> this

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
cabinet already done reason I got this

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.980 
cabinet already done reason I got this
is<00:07:07.240> because<00:07:07.420> it<00:07:07.480> was<00:07:07.600> like<00:07:07.690> two<00:07:07.840> or<00:07:07.930> three

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
is because it was like two or three

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.780 
is because it was like two or three
bucks<00:07:08.350> cheaper<00:07:08.650> than<00:07:08.890> the<00:07:09.010> regular<00:07:09.190> Stoker's

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
bucks cheaper than the regular Stoker's

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.840 
bucks cheaper than the regular Stoker's
