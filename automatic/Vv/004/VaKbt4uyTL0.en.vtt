00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.970
 hello friends I'm paco 9999 in my second 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.009
 video about you play swell of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.860
 legends or in Spanish league of legends 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.290
 League of Legends was released on 27 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.300
 October 2009 by the river company 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.400
 game of being a mere stranger to 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.560
 become the most played game 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.390
 world we can not think of a better 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.400
 argument that justifies returning to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.890
 enter today on the map of the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.630
 geof legends to reanalyze now with 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.910
 greater perspective on what really 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 we are dealing with the biggest phenomenon 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.860
 videojueguil of the moment for platform 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.079
 some released as a simple clone 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.539
 evolved the veteran mode will cap 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.430
 warcraft 3 a little over three years ago 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.770
 riot has not left for those who are not 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.710
 ever played a mob to the goal is 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.809
 simple we incarnate a champion who with 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.149
 the help of four other controlled by 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.280
 colleagues is part of a team that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.109
 will fight against five opponents with the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.600
 sole purpose of destroying its main base 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.940
 while the opposing team tries to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.519
 end with ours to that simple 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.470
 equation obviously lacks variables 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.000
 and nuances that enrich the experience 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.710
 of game 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 the map where the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.880
 games is symmetrical for one and the other 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.850
 team and is composed of three paths 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.380
 main top midi board that connect 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.450
 one basis with the other and in which 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.640
 we develop our champion based 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.530
 kill opponents of rival team towers 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.450
 of defense that make our 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 advance towards the enemy base and you can 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 it seems surprising that such a concept 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.630
 simple may have become the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.030
 phenomenon that is today and the reason is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.910
 that behind that simple formula is 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.920
 hides much more existing more than 100 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.380
 different champions all different 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.790
 each other and taking into account that each 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.160
 champion has its own 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.320
 characteristics skills and role within 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.360
 of the battlefield the possibilities 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 in a competitive online scenario are 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
 almost endless all stand out in a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.020
 certain function and lack of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.670
 potential in another and that's where it comes in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 team play with the rest of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.850
 companions 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.280
 there are suitable champions for the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 hand-to-hand combat specialists in 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.989
 the use of magic experts in the murder 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.330
 or resistant to damage but none of 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.070
 they are enough 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.780
 self-sufficient is worth the redundancy as 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.910
 to not need the virtues 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.100
 his companions entered the bases 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.959
 that define the axis of legends and the rest 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.790
 to move to as such it's time to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.310
 go into detail what difference to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 river play the rest and it's in that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.000
 responsibility on the part of each 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.920
 player to lead the battle of good 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.739
 term where they rise from wall from which 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.900
 We were talking to you earlier because the failure of 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.120
 One directly affects the rest of the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 first games with a fashion are usually 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.069
 frustrating and that's why at 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.470
 develop the legends from the 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.510
 base established in dota riot decided 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.430
 adapt some of its mechanics to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.709
 that the learning curve was more 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.530
 soft and definitely offer a 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.810
 gaming experience much more accessible 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.700
 so riot ended up with no power 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.590
 kill our own minions for 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.780
 that the rival team does not obtain gold or 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.540
 experience with the loss of gold to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.850
 die with them are attenuated thanks to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.920
 those changes the first steps in the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.900
 legends are much more bearable 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.930
 inviting the uninitiated to follow 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.760
 Experiencing learning and improving 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.190
 the only problem derived from these 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.720
 changes as you can imagine is the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.680
 reduction of depth and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 complexity 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.120
 level by leaving him of legends as a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.760
 much more direct and a priori proposal 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.069
 without complications that of the rest 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.109
 In turn, youth implemented a system of 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.879
 progression alien to the games themselves in 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.489
 the one that the players are going up from 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.010
 level up to 30 as you participate in 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.230
 online games and therefore at the time 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.230
 of searching for public games are organized 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.170
 groups of similar level lol is a game 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.700
 absorbent that takes away too much time I know 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.340
 which is a recurring theme in many 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.200
 online multiplayer games but in this 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.049
 case I would like to highlight one aspect 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.299
 concrete lol aside from being addictive 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.909
 it involves large investments of time in 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.909
 each game play a normal game 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.280
 it takes an average of 40 minutes a time 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.799
 in which you can not leave the game 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.650
 neither totally nor almost momentarily because 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.629
 you harm your team and if you do 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.599
 expose to bans and not be able to play more 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.039
 in other words it is not a game that 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.320
 you can leave when you want 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.470
 the lol itself conditions your time of 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.190
 game to a certain extent is a game of 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.790
 elite or rather elitist hundreds of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.100
 games 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.810
 in which players brand as nova 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.760
 to others for small failures or 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.160
 simply for not being as good as 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.590
 them or even by just starting to 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.450
 play recently instead of being a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.180
 little sympathetic or help them or 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.980
 advise them this kind of people be the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.290
 He's fucking around the game as soon as 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.330
 have an error and do not get off of asshole 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.250
 in my case, a lot of 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.020
 times and instead of helping you get up on 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.000
 they leave more but in the end you do not have to 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.430
 keep playing all to hell in 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.260
 conclusion is a great game you will have fun 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.120
 a lot although it can be a little 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.980
 frustrating at first but after 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.920
 a few days you will try to be the 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.320
 better believe me it happened to me like this I saw my 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.320
 carnal playing and telling him that you see him 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.230
 that fucking game and he told me he 's sorry 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.360
 and I really played it and believe me I do not know 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.850
 will regret I try to be the best 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.830
 but they always kick my ass when 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.660
 more you enjoy is when you touch the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.330
 novices or better known as no 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.520
 giveaways of xdddd is super 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.310
 funny because you can only kill

 all xd xd xd i 'll say in the non-league of 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.420

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.300
 double murder 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.470
 he is innate triple quadruple murder and 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.740
 pp ppp 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.020
