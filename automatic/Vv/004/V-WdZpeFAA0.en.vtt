00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
start off by drawing the line out and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
start off by drawing the line out and
connecting<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> bottom<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> filling

I<00:01:36.950> don't<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> defined<00:01:38.549> crease<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.420> my

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I don't have a defined crease so my

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
I don't have a defined crease so my
favorite<00:01:39.929> thing<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.679> just<00:01:40.740> add<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> warm

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
brown shade to my crease so it adds more

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.620

dimension<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.609> eyes<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.329> I'm<00:01:48.479> just

so that my lips look more full and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.259 
so that my lips look more full and
that's<00:02:25.560> pretty<00:02:25.799> much<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.099> for<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.579> face<00:02:26.790> now
