00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
some bodyweight alternatives to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
some bodyweight alternatives to
deadlifts<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> doesn't<00:00:43.829> mean<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> don't

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
deadlifts but that doesn't mean I don't

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.319 
deadlifts but that doesn't mean I don't
think<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> deadlift<00:00:44.820> isn't<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> great

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
think the deadlift isn't a great

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.229 
think the deadlift isn't a great
exercise<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> great<00:00:47.010> exercise<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.059> not

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
exercise it is a great exercise but not

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
exercise it is a great exercise but not
everybody<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.750> access<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.500> weights<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> gym

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
everybody has access to weights or a gym

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.350 
everybody has access to weights or a gym
