00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
retro controller experience a bit it's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450 
retro controller experience a bit it's
easy<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.200> cheap<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> do<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.429> know

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
easy and it's cheap to do and I know

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.079 
easy and it's cheap to do and I know
before<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.179> show<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.139> or<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.349> see<00:00:13.650> it

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
before I show it to you or you see it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.300 
before I show it to you or you see it
and<00:00:15.089> say<00:00:15.330> anything<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and say anything that that it is it is a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.200 
and say anything that that it is it is a
bit<00:00:17.609> ghetto<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> injury<00:00:18.720> rate<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.439> will

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
bit ghetto and injury rate if you will

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
bit ghetto and injury rate if you will
but<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.449> effective<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.310> need<00:00:23.460> for

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
but it is effective and all you need for

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.109 
but it is effective and all you need for
this<00:00:23.699> project<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> thick<00:00:25.410> about<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> 13<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this project is a thick about a 13 to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.720 
this project is a thick about a 13 to
half<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.750> inch<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.050> diameter<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.800> hot<00:00:29.369> glue

stick and some hot fire or some fire

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
stick and some hot fire or some fire
that's<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:34.800> yeah<00:00:35.070> whatever<00:00:35.340> okay

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that's it that is how yeah whatever okay

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.470 
that's it that is how yeah whatever okay
and<00:00:37.850> fundamentally<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.120> trying<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and fundamentally what we're trying to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.049 
and fundamentally what we're trying to
achieve<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.829> turn<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> standard<00:00:41.670> d<00:00:41.790> pad

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
achieve here is to turn a standard d pad

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.299 
achieve here is to turn a standard d pad
on<00:00:42.300> your<00:00:42.329> retro<00:00:42.780> control<00:00:43.110> unlike<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> NES<00:00:43.980> or

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
on your retro control unlike the NES or

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
on your retro control unlike the NES or
or<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.809> Sega<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> Master<00:00:47.610> System<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.420> even

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
or the Sega or the Master System or even

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
or the Sega or the Master System or even
the<00:00:49.200> Super<00:00:49.920> Nintendo<00:00:50.010> hell<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:51.000> even<00:00:51.030> done

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the Super Nintendo hell I've even done

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
the Super Nintendo hell I've even done
it<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:52.410> gameboy<00:00:52.649> basically<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:54.480> trying

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it for my gameboy basically we're trying

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
it for my gameboy basically we're trying
to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.260> fundamentally<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.129> we're<00:00:56.309> trying

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to do or fundamentally what we're trying

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
to do or fundamentally what we're trying
to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.030> turn<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> standard<00:00:58.530> d-pad<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to do is turn that standard d-pad into a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
to do is turn that standard d-pad into a
joystick<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:01.070> more<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.190> less<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.609> simulation<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
joystick or more or less a simulation of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
joystick or more or less a simulation of
an<00:01:03.719> analog<00:01:04.080> stick<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
an analog stick because that's kind of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
an analog stick because that's kind of
what<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.790> fill<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
what the the fill that I get out of it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.640 
what the the fill that I get out of it
at<00:01:06.990> least<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> I'll<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.880> through<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.210> steps

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
at least and I'll go through the steps

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:21.030 
at least and I'll go through the steps
albeit<00:01:10.650> short<00:01:10.860> steps<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.790> accomplish<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.830 

all<00:01:21.400> right<00:01:21.640> guys<00:01:21.940> let's<00:01:22.150> take<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> look<00:01:22.630> at<00:01:22.750> what

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
all right guys let's take a look at what

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.520 
all right guys let's take a look at what
we<00:01:22.960> got<00:01:23.080> here<00:01:24.300> basically<00:01:25.300> what<00:01:25.810> you're<00:01:26.290> going

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
we got here basically what you're going

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.600 
we got here basically what you're going
to<00:01:26.650> need<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:28.120> lighter<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:30.070> some<00:01:30.340> hot<00:01:30.490> glue

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
to need is a lighter on some hot glue

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.050 
to need is a lighter on some hot glue
sticks<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.860> thickness<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.850> can<00:01:33.970> go

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
sticks about the thickness you can go

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.110 
sticks about the thickness you can go
thicker<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:34.780> go<00:01:35.160> thinner<00:01:36.160> just<00:01:36.550> however

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
thicker you can go thinner just however

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.010 
thicker you can go thinner just however
it<00:01:37.800> whatever<00:01:38.800> feels<00:01:39.040> right<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:40.020> alright

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
it whatever feels right to you alright

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.660 
it whatever feels right to you alright
so<00:01:41.200> what<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.620> want<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.830> do<00:01:42.040> with<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.520> glue

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
so what we want to do with the glue

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.840 
so what we want to do with the glue
stick<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.620> we<00:01:44.620> want<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.830> cut<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.280> down<00:01:45.370> to<00:01:45.610> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
stick is we want to cut it down to the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.200 
stick is we want to cut it down to the
size<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.250> feels<00:01:48.460> right<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.880> longer

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
size that that feels right the longer

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.120 
size that that feels right the longer
that<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.350> keep<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.920> more

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
that you you you keep it the more

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.290 
that you you you keep it the more
joystick<00:01:51.910> ish<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.870> fills<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.880> shorter<00:01:55.210> you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
joystick ish it fills the shorter you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.180 
joystick ish it fills the shorter you
cut<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.540> down<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.690> them<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.320> more<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.830> kind<00:01:57.160> of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
cut it down to them the more it kind of

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.609 
cut it down to them the more it kind of
feels<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.960> like<00:01:59.110> an<00:01:59.229> analog

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
feels like a kind of like an analog

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.050 
feels like a kind of like an analog
stick<00:01:59.979> kind<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.430> gives<00:02:00.550> you<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.759> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
stick kind of gives you that that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.290 
stick kind of gives you that that
simulated<00:02:01.750> film<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.090> an

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
simulated film basically here is an

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.060 
simulated film basically here is an
example<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:05.110> what<00:02:05.680> what<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.580> would<00:02:06.700> look<00:02:06.850> like

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070

the time i get said a good fill it could

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.870 
the time i get said a good fill it could
be<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> little<00:02:17.530> bit<00:02:17.709> shorter<00:02:18.070> if<00:02:18.190> i<00:02:18.310> wanted<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
be a little bit shorter if i wanted it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.240 
be a little bit shorter if i wanted it
to<00:02:19.000> feel<00:02:19.150> more<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.770> like<00:02:20.770> an<00:02:20.890> analog

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the d-pad the actual i guess you would

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.160 
the d-pad the actual i guess you would
call<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.880> kind<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.360> plunges<00:02:40.780> underneath

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
call it kind of like plunges underneath

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.070 
call it kind of like plunges underneath
the<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.920> buttons<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.489> plastic<00:02:42.940> buttons<00:02:43.840> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
the the buttons the plastic buttons that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100 
the the buttons the plastic buttons that
hit<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.500> button<00:02:45.430> sensor<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.420> PCB

hit the button sensor on the PCB

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.800 
hit the button sensor on the PCB
underneath<00:02:47.670> sometimes<00:02:48.670> those<00:02:49.209> plungers<00:02:49.690> were

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
underneath sometimes those plungers were

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.940 
underneath sometimes those plungers were
out<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:52.090> get<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.269> little<00:02:52.420> harder<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.930> push<00:02:53.200> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
out they get a little harder to push you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.380 
out they get a little harder to push you
know<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.130> get<00:02:54.610> actually<00:02:55.060> pushing<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.330> little

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
know to get actually pushing a little

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.780 
know to get actually pushing a little
hard<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.080> get<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> respond<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.250> this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
hard to get it to respond and and this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
hard to get it to respond and and this
even<00:02:58.090> kind<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.299> helps<00:02:58.540> set<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.930> scenario<00:02:59.320> a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
even kind of helps set that scenario a

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.150 
even kind of helps set that scenario a
little<00:02:59.769> bit<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.540> project<00:03:01.989> here<00:03:02.200> so

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
little bit to the project here so

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.250 
little bit to the project here so
basically<00:03:03.400> i<00:03:03.489> want<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> do<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.060> want<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.810> cut

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
basically i want to do is I want to cut

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
basically i want to do is I want to cut
the<00:03:06.070> glue<00:03:06.489> stick<00:03:06.730> down<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:08.160> actually<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.400> want

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
the glue stick down and actually I want

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.720 
the glue stick down and actually I want
to<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.959> for<00:03:11.440> my<00:03:11.680> gameboy<00:03:11.950> color<00:03:12.100> here<00:03:12.519> I'm

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
to do it for my gameboy color here I'm

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.710 
to do it for my gameboy color here I'm
actually<00:03:12.880> going<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.180> put<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.450> there<00:03:13.600> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
actually going to put it on there to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.789 
actually going to put it on there to
show<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.140> actually<00:03:14.260> works<00:03:14.560> with

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
show you that it actually works with

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.800 
show you that it actually works with
with<00:03:15.220> even<00:03:15.489> smaller<00:03:15.760> d-pads<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.570> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
with even smaller d-pads like this and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.449 
with even smaller d-pads like this and
it<00:03:16.870> works<00:03:17.320> pretty<00:03:17.440> well<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:17.890> I'm<00:03:18.190> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.340> try

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it works pretty well so I'm going to try

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.970 
it works pretty well so I'm going to try
to<00:03:18.519> cut<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.880> short<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
to cut it short on this one so it you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.380 
to cut it short on this one so it you
know<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.190> feels<00:03:21.370> more<00:03:21.820> comfortable<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:22.269> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
know it feels more comfortable on the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.789 
know it feels more comfortable on the
hand<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.690> your<00:03:22.900> thumbs<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.440> stick<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.739> all

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
before you before you cut it down you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.099 
before you before you cut it down you
want<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.530> hold<00:03:29.919> the<00:03:30.040> controller<00:03:30.400> or<00:03:31.109> portable

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.830 
ideally you want it to be like flat like
that<00:03:57.579> it's<00:03:57.969> almost<00:03:58.090> impossible<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.689> do

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
that it's almost impossible to do

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.839 
that it's almost impossible to do
without<00:03:58.959> like<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.319> razor<00:03:59.889> or<00:04:00.219> a<00:04:00.280> knife<00:04:00.489> i'm<00:04:00.700> just

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
without like a razor or a knife i'm just

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.190 
without like a razor or a knife i'm just
using<00:04:01.030> scissors<00:04:01.329> so<00:04:01.629> it<00:04:01.719> is<00:04:01.810> kind<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:01.989> hard<00:04:02.109> to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
using scissors so it is kind of hard to

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.399 
using scissors so it is kind of hard to
get<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:02.469> an<00:04:02.650> even<00:04:03.189> cut<00:04:03.569> but<00:04:04.569> what<00:04:04.959> we'll<00:04:05.079> do<00:04:05.200> is

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
get it an even cut but what we'll do is

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.559 
get it an even cut but what we'll do is
I<00:04:05.590> want<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.829> cut<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.040> maybe<00:04:06.909> like<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.120> half<00:04:07.329> in<00:04:07.480> it

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
I want to cut it maybe like a half in it

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.940 
I want to cut it maybe like a half in it
maybe<00:04:07.959> like<00:04:08.169> a<00:04:08.200> half<00:04:08.379> an<00:04:08.500> inch<00:04:08.620> couple

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
maybe like a half an inch couple

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.159 
maybe like a half an inch couple
centimeters<00:04:09.189> or<00:04:09.430> something<00:04:09.760> like<00:04:09.879> that<00:04:10.169> let

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
centimeters or something like that let

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.690 
centimeters or something like that let
me<00:04:11.260> try<00:04:11.409> to<00:04:11.470> rotate<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.889> scissors<00:04:12.189> as<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:12.519> it

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
me try to rotate the scissors as I do it

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.810 
me try to rotate the scissors as I do it
so<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:12.879> can<00:04:12.939> I<00:04:13.060> gives<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.359> clean<00:04:13.540> cut<00:04:20.699> so<00:04:21.699> this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
so it can I gives it a clean cut so this

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.969 
so it can I gives it a clean cut so this
is<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.060> piece<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:23.470> were<00:04:23.560> left<00:04:23.740> with

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
is the piece that that were left with

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.249 
is the piece that that were left with
okay<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.389> trick<00:04:25.599> is<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:28.270> trick<00:04:28.539> is<00:04:28.750> to

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
okay so the trick is the trick is to

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.930 
okay so the trick is the trick is to
actually<00:04:29.590> lightly<00:04:30.539> burn<00:04:31.539> or<00:04:32.460> lightly<00:04:33.460> melt

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
actually lightly burn or lightly melt

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.510 
actually lightly burn or lightly melt
the<00:04:34.930> end<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:39.070> glue<00:04:39.220> stick<00:04:39.430> that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
the end of the of the glue stick that

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.920 
the end of the of the glue stick that
you're<00:04:39.639> going<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.789> pull<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.030> d-pad<00:04:40.389> until<00:04:40.810> you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
you're going to pull the d-pad until you

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.589 
you're going to pull the d-pad until you
see<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.199> get<00:04:41.530> kind<00:04:41.889> of<00:04:41.949> glossy<00:04:42.430> you're<00:04:43.180> not<00:04:43.330> not

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
see it get kind of glossy you're not not

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.939 
see it get kind of glossy you're not not
dripping<00:04:43.930> because<00:04:44.199> one<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.440> dripping<00:04:44.830> us

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
dripping because one it's dripping us

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.170 
dripping because one it's dripping us
too<00:04:45.130> much<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.520> wanted<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.880> get<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.090> kind

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
too much you just wanted to get it kind

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.250 
too much you just wanted to get it kind
of<00:04:46.270> Gaul<00:04:46.449> so<00:04:46.599> you<00:04:46.690> don't<00:04:46.840> want<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.110> melt

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
of Gaul so you don't want it to melt

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.350 
of Gaul so you don't want it to melt
completely<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:48.099> then<00:04:48.970> place<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.409> right<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.270> I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
completely and then place it right and I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.750 
completely and then place it right and I
brought<00:04:52.510> us<00:04:52.630> in<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.930> middle<00:04:53.139> as<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.380> can<00:04:53.760> on

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
brought us in the middle as you can on

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.980 
brought us in the middle as you can on
the<00:04:54.970> d-pad<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.419> don't<00:04:55.570> have<00:04:55.659> it<00:04:55.750> too<00:04:55.870> much

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
the d-pad you don't have it too much

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
the d-pad you don't have it too much
pressure<00:04:56.229> because<00:04:56.409> you<00:04:56.650> don't<00:04:56.800> want<00:04:56.919> that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
pressure because you don't want that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.879 
pressure because you don't want that
glue<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.370> melt<00:04:57.580> down<00:04:58.320> beyond<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.500> top<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.830> the

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
glue to melt down beyond the top of the

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.500 
glue to melt down beyond the top of the
d-pad<00:05:00.280> because<00:05:00.699> you<00:05:00.820> know<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.120> can<00:05:01.270> kind<00:05:01.449> of

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
d-pad because you know that can kind of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.330 
d-pad because you know that can kind of
get<00:05:01.630> underneath<00:05:01.900> your<00:05:02.199> d-pad<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.830> make<00:05:03.220> it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
get underneath your d-pad and make it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.800 
get underneath your d-pad and make it
harder<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.610> control<00:05:03.849> but<00:05:04.240> if<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.389> do<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.630> just

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
harder to control but if you do it just

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.990 
harder to control but if you do it just
try<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.169> actually<00:05:05.289> works<00:05:05.650> pretty<00:05:05.740> well<00:05:06.000> so

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
try it it actually works pretty well so

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.749 
try it it actually works pretty well so
you<00:05:07.090> cannot<00:05:07.270> let<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.509> dry<00:05:09.780> let<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.870> dry<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.139> set

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
you cannot let it dry let it dry and set

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.230 
you cannot let it dry let it dry and set
and<00:05:13.380> there<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.470> go<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:14.800> that's<00:05:14.949> kind<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.159> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
and there you go so that's kind of the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.610 
and there you go so that's kind of the
basic<00:05:16.240> idea<00:05:16.539> behind<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.900> but<00:05:17.050> they're<00:05:17.289> easily

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
basic idea behind it but they're easily

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.200 
basic idea behind it but they're easily
there's<00:05:18.039> even<00:05:18.250> one<00:05:18.280> step<00:05:18.550> further<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.120> we

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
there's even one step further that we

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.480 
there's even one step further that we
can<00:05:19.389> go<00:05:19.539> to<00:05:19.599> to<00:05:20.470> make<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.770> gaming<00:05:21.130> experience

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
can go to to make the gaming experience

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.629 
can go to to make the gaming experience
even<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.940> even<00:05:22.599> better<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.949> what<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.159> do<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.400> I

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
even and even better and what I do is I

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.279 
even and even better and what I do is I
do<00:05:24.849> pretty<00:05:25.150> much<00:05:25.240> exactly<00:05:25.570> what<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.900> did<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.199> the

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
do pretty much exactly what I did to the

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.749 
do pretty much exactly what I did to the
one<00:05:26.470> side<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:26.860> we<00:05:26.919> stuck<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.280> d-pad<00:05:27.580> to

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
one side that we stuck to the d-pad to

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.529 
one side that we stuck to the d-pad to
the<00:05:27.849> top<00:05:28.030> here<00:05:28.979> kind<00:05:29.979> of<00:05:30.090> get<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.210> nice<00:05:31.389> and

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
the top here kind of get it nice and

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.570 
the top here kind of get it nice and
kind<00:05:34.539> of<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:34.659> gloss<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:36.280> don't<00:05:36.400> want<00:05:36.520> to

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
kind of a gloss to it you don't want to

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.189 
kind of a gloss to it you don't want to
get<00:05:36.759> super<00:05:37.240> super<00:05:37.539> hot<00:05:37.810> because<00:05:37.990> you're<00:05:38.110> going

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
get super super hot because you're going

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.450 
get super super hot because you're going
to<00:05:38.259> burn<00:05:38.380> this<00:05:38.620> out<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.949> yourself<00:05:39.250> if<00:05:39.370> you

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
to burn this out it yourself if you

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.520 
to burn this out it yourself if you
do<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.759> but<00:05:39.970> just<00:05:40.930> kind<00:05:41.169> of<00:05:41.199> want<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.409> get<00:05:41.470> it

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
do that but just kind of want to get it

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.440 
do that but just kind of want to get it
there<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.979> then<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:42.760> want<00:05:42.909> to<00:05:43.060> hold<00:05:43.240> it<00:05:43.330> in

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
there and then you want to hold it in
