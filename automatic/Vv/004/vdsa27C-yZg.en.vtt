the animation team is built over an hour
of<00:03:42.580> new<00:03:42.730> animations<00:03:43.270> just<00:03:43.510> for<00:03:43.690> Connor<00:03:43.930> alone

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
of new animations just for Connor alone

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.800 
of new animations just for Connor alone
we<00:03:45.010> started<00:03:45.459> by<00:03:45.610> looking<00:03:45.819> at<00:03:46.030> lots<00:03:46.660> of

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
we started by looking at lots of

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.650 
we started by looking at lots of
military<00:03:47.349> moves<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.370> even<00:03:48.970> traditional<00:03:49.120> ones

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
military moves and even traditional ones

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.229 
military moves and even traditional ones
of<00:03:49.870> how<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.470> would<00:03:50.560> fight<00:03:50.770> with<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.950> tomahawk

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
of how you would fight with a tomahawk

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.220 
of how you would fight with a tomahawk
repeated<00:03:52.239> art<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.569> we<00:03:52.630> just<00:03:52.959> thought<00:03:53.020> it

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
repeated art and we just thought it

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620 
repeated art and we just thought it
wasn't<00:03:53.680> awesome<00:03:53.920> enough<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:55.120> went<00:03:55.330> really

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.229 
wasn't awesome enough so we went really
brutal<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.410> wasn't<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:57.120> throwing<00:03:58.120> in

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:07.320 
brutal and it wasn't just throwing in
board<00:04:05.069> we<00:04:06.069> put<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> lot<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.670> time<00:04:06.970> into<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
board we put a lot of time into the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.750 
board we put a lot of time into the
navigation<00:04:07.930> elements<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.560> we've<00:04:09.190> completely

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
navigation elements and we've completely

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.210 
navigation elements and we've completely
redone<00:04:10.269> our<00:04:10.450> climb<00:04:10.720> system<00:04:11.200> we<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.950> wanted

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
redone our climb system we really wanted

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.090 
redone our climb system we really wanted
it<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.459> be<00:04:12.580> much<00:04:12.790> more<00:04:12.819> organic<00:04:13.769> there's<00:04:14.769> so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
it to be much more organic there's so

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.860 
it to be much more organic there's so
much<00:04:15.280> variety<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.940> what<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.299> climb<00:04:16.570> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
much variety and what you can climb and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.349 
much variety and what you can climb and
how<00:04:17.079> we<00:04:17.139> can<00:04:17.290> do<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.790> Connor<00:04:18.790> moves<00:04:19.090> are

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
how we can do it Connor moves are

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.680 
how we can do it Connor moves are
