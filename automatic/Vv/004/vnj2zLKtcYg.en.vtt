00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.689
 an old bone in the network but where he wants 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.890
 Well, everyone is squeezing and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 give hope you're fine 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 listen to me it's going great today the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 people we find ourselves for a new 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 video on black ops 2 we are in neighborhood 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.489
 general overflow map for a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.379
 nuclear smr with 61 gastric 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.860
 so that's part of the gameplay that I 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.840
 have you recently proposed on my 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 latest videos frankly a good 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.480
 gameplay that was performed in a group of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 three years that we are narrow by cons 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.150
 this is the problem of the gameplay is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 that there has been a lot of rage leaving so 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.260
 necessarily there is a lot of white whose 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.700
 gameplay I tried to handle that to my 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.350
 way I put a few cuts 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.840
 story here is the gameplay 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.500
 not too disgusting to see an interesting 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.220
 for you so are crazy hendrick 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 together I mean it's not 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.339
 badly frankly especially this is for a 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.219
 time we were not in the group of six 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.500
 like big pig to hatch spawn and 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.750
 it was finally spot who understood me and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 frankly pretty good huh for 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 to be honest with you I even go up to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.189
 smr in gold to have the girls of his 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.829
 diamond because it's just me 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.780
 was just missing the smr I had to do 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.159
 thirty be hot 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.189
 then I just had to attack the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.009
 that they are the axes of the assets of the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.049
 accessories and frankly good I did 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.369
 not necessarily aim that the heads but 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.170
 my general I do this as and when 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.789
 measure 1 and panting say that what a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 part where I'm going to do without the smr 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.509
 there must be four or five is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.609
 hot that I had to m I see it's 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.359
 for that I do things like 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.719
 that in general 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.670
 good there at the moment I already had 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.649
 my diamond assault rifles because 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.779
 the gameplay is not new and dot 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.719
 about a week ago I mean 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.619
 if it's maybe it's not more 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.020
 so frankly I'm happy 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.939
 the assault rifles in diamonds this is a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.439
 good thing because here you have to know 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.469
 that I miss a few times on this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.020
 black ops 2 this is a game where I 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.150
 really played a lot and obviously more 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.830
 I still play while waiting for the next 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.950
 code because these cost patients that I 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.780
 am going to play once it's a little 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.830
 here is a little slow night so I 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.300
 found a way to take care of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 I finished my sons and sounds we 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.350
 did that just then on 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.660
 hayden vlc my account 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.210
 my old main account I have some 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.090
 guns two not guns I have 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.980
 diamond threshers I'm trying there for 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.620
 the blow is really the big pig 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.580
 but now I found him if 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.430
 find and style of the mettrons 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.890
 diamonds I do not know why I you 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.830
 admit that it was really a bit 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.630
 very early on where I played blackhawks 2 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.440
 so here it was my first jarmon 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.470
 diamond and of course this tale christine 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600
 in the jets the assault rifles the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.210
 sniper and I 'm going to say that also on the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 dncg them but treats the sng 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.020
 that makes me four categories of weapons in 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.310
 diamond it's pretty good my proud game 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.100
 from me that I could do a little 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.290
 on this game 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.820
 frankly it's pretty cool here I 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.900
 do them anyway well late 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.870
 there are people who have had it but 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.120
 so long before me but me 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.460
 I do not care a try is never too much 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.260
 late so now we're going to talk 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.600
 a bit of the gameplay whose gameplay there is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.070
 had dream skies and magic flasher with 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.930
 me so you come back skies who is the 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.870
 co-leader of the dream and magic flachaire 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.430
 one of my oldest friends up in game 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.290
 we made a first together 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.460
 which was called had xact with 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 other players like for example 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.100
 invested and until I spend a dedication 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.780
 is also date sensei do big 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 memories and well here we said we 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.950
 will play a little qg etc 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 there were only three at that time and 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.530
 I confess that I still have them 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.070
 asked sometimes to leave me some 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.150
 guides etc 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.370
 I really wanted a big one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.320
 gastric gameplay and I thank them 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.360
 just to cram hamadi clash 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.980
 urban to have left me the kills when 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.270
 he had to 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.620
 it's a pretty complete gameplay 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.290
 mean what are 1 a strict 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.360
 here we are going to say that it is correct the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.920
 problem is that there are some 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.750
 wingers who captured the qg 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.990
 it makes sure that precisely there is 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.740
 not had all the game 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.200
 there was not all the game all 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.950
 I just confess I'm biting to 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.810
 strict manganese 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.030
 so it is not because there were more 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.890
 the time the score was over 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.720
 that's what I made a mistake at 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.450
 level of my travels to the nightmare 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.680
 I really liked doing more but 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.700
 little mistake on my part your worst 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.760
 mean well done for my mouth 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.930
 but it's true that under the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.690
 pressure finally qg that are captured 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.370
 guys who are 2 3 and that's it 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.690
 that they let go in guinea risk 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.470
 you all tops with loads 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.140
 electrical etc 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.910
 it was a bit scared eh in the 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.900
 fields in any case the charges 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.980
 electric we do not see too much in 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.610
 the game you'll see a moment where he 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.050
 will have one 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.220
 because guys who see there they are 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.780
 burned a little I want to say of 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.100
 play then it's limited if if that's the 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.290
 purpose to make us angry because they 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.420
 were only 2 finally snowshoe 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.370
 of rage quit as usual a giant 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.740
 but to say and I can understand a 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.690
 guy who would say they become a 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.070
 part there are microphones so that wants 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.110
 to say that it was not them who made a 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.430
 mistake to take the mic and they 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.390
 take the place of others 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.979
 I understand that people they 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.639
 leave there is no problem at this level 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.300
 I leave to their month 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.830
 I understand very well however to see 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.719
 I think I even thought that you 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.550
 that's good brief and frankly 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.029
 to be honest with you in a 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.590
 gameplay 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.120
 finally like in the others I want 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.219
 say when I'm in studio mode and that 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.020
 I am a semi automatic weapon 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.460
 I have the impression of being a 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.129
 connector I feel like I have a 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.379
 fast fire for those who think the 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.270
 same as me because me when 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.249
 even I'm sure of that 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.330
 that I am doing I am convinced of how 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.580
 we play how it goes when we 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.849
 plays I can guarantee you it's not 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.129
 the case 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:58.289
 really it's more complicated than that and 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.759
 I really do not go one shot like 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.629
 that and I do not shoot as fast as 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.879
 I think it's a bit of a word 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.279
 studio that make sure that happens 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.689
 like that so quickly it's clear because 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.800
 I want them to put ps4 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.789
 I mean, it's a little better 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.300
 level of the triggers but that's it 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.430
 not a quick fire either a brief 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.249
 thing to add I can now the 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.659
 fencing in 360p I really want to 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.759
 offer you live stream why 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.589
 not come at a time when you have not 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.870
 great thing to do that you finished 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.889
 your homework etc. 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.539
 finally for the youngest skins 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.949
 of you hat be nice song 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.060
 we will do there I think with the 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.129
 dream there will be me that he will make a 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.469
 poet man view an old soap opera 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:39.569
 sorry good example is crappy but in 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.779
 big stream where there will be my view is 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:45.000
 that a poet of view and no moment there 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.469
 will have gta and code something that 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.939
 scary is that even if it's 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:50.849
 of the three years we pay I'm afraid he 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.529
 is I have of you who happens to do 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.089
 there are no streams due to their connection 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.039
 so already that it's been necessary to transform that 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:59.909
 the quality is not tip top 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:01.979
 this can be illizi for 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:05.100
 the stream you have galley see it 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.630
 stole the quality it's going to be poop 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.130
 but well that's why not try in 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.450
 anyway I'm really happy 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.940
 now i can stream the ag the 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.070
 connection just for stream 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.650
 I admit you stream now I 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.870
 falls in the pubs without ping so that's 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.760
 downright a disadvantage but it's not 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.500
 serious we will do with because the 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.870
 Stream is that it can be more than that 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.580
 fart mans we're all going to hit a bar 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.740
 for example I was with the dream and I 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.700
 think you may be playing 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.000
 with us stuff like that so 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.500
 why not here I will put the chain 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.900
 from my twitter the description in all 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.500
 case that's the end of this video 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.580
 do not forget there and that makes me 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.050
 always pleasure I wish you to 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.910

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.240
