00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.059
 hi how about in this case with a video 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.130
 about the color bath normally 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.650
 many times we ask for a bath of color 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.280
 then to rekindle the tone of the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 hair but to let us go with 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.610
 the washes that do not remain then root 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.550
 sometimes called color bath 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.509
 dyes that although they carry a water 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.940
 oxygenated lower is believed that then as 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.650
 It has a very low base, because then it 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.320
 goes with the washes but in the end always 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.960
 leaves something root then so that 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.750
 you have a clear color bath 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.329
 to leave with the washes and not be left 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.470
 root has to be a product where 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.720
 just come a boat in this case is this 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.370
 do not mix with anything or come 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.379
 mixed with nothing that only the color 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.050
 there are for example masks with color 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.790
 that in addition to nourishing and hydrating the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.720
 hair will give us that shine 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.369
 towards the tone we want in addition to 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.810
 natural tones as they can be 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.729
 poor chestnut chocolates for good 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.610
 redheads or people that normally we 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.009
 we have like this in shades poor and then 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.820
 we also have already in masks and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.580
 even of this type of products then 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.850
 in blue purple fantasy tones 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.710
 green good for those shades we would have 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.050
 than having a red wick to 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.899
 what would it look like if they would not give us a light 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.210
 reflex but you would hardly see that tone 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.670
 so you know that when you ask for a bath 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.860
 of color that you want to go with the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.930
 you have to give a product 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.000
 that is only one 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.580
 that does not have oxygenated water even though 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.830
 be to two volumes or one that does not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.650
 have no oxygenated water then 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.090
 will continue with the washings I in my case 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.770
 purchased from the brand schwarzkopf 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 the brand and gora 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:18.300
 color block if you see well gloss color 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.770
 direct color direct color number 77 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.570
 it's a good copper if you've seen my 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.760
 previous videos of the colors that I 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.940
 I will always be going on the range 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:40.350
 of the copper and you are going to see a little 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:43.010
 as I had my hair before then 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.400
 both washed because I had enough 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.060
 without much shine like more more hair 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.390
 and well I wanted to rekindle again and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.540
 also having those goals so clear 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.090
 as I had in the whole area of ​​the tips 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.690
 because there is always going to take much more 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.980
 color than what is going to be in my tone 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.390
 natural that I have on top 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.760
 so good as I do not have here 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.280
 the light so good and they do not look good 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.560
 well the result because it has come to me 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.570
 balcony and has recorded again a little and 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.880
 good to see if you see here more or less 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.540
 how is the result 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.990
 copper already applied and with good light 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.990
 Clear 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.470
 Well, you are going to see that it is very, very 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.650
 simple to do and nothing that I leave the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.740
 step by step with freshly washed hair 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.800
 and wet we will be doing the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.510
 deals to make it easier for us 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.510
 and faster to apply the color 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:07.250
 we are going to apply in the whole contour a 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:09.439
 cream so as not to stain the skin and 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.950
 We start at the nape area in my 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:16.009
 case as all the tone of the roots is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.859
 of my color and the tone that I'm going to give 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.620
 will simply cover what I do 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.770
 it's what I 'm combing through, 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.860
 little by the root but as you can see 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.229
 I'm giving everything in the case of having 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.780
 wicks from the root if I had given 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.560
 for everything but in my case as the wicks 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.820
 they are in the middle and ends in the root 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.940
 I do not have to give little by little for everything 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.610
 it so I'm taking the lock 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.280
 Tuft I will apply the maximum color 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.280
 in the middle and ends and I'm combing 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.919
 yes 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:00.299
 and so we're going to do all the 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.299
 hair 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.070
 we go over the contours a little 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.070
 we comb everything well and leave it together 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.179
 how am I going to straighten my hair so that 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.819
 you see better the color a first I give myself 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:38.419
 a product that helps me smooth and now 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.889
 I start to dry with the hand dryer 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.559
 first I work the bangs area 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.659
 drying from one side to the other and then 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:52.110
 removing moisture for all the rest 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:54.040
 of the hair with the round brush I'll 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.890
 start working 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.750
 flequillo area could go 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.830
 taking sections from the neck little to 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:06.610
 little but I 'm going to do more 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.170
 crazy and good fast plan all over 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:18.760
 I'm going to mark the ends a little 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:20.020
 but then work on the iron the 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.960
 iron in this case I'm also going to 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:27.360
 start with the bangs area I'm not going 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.360
 to go leaving smooth and sideways 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.830
 and what I 'm going to do is mark some 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:37.009
 light waves for the rest the area of 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.080
 the sideburns the waves are going to go towards 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:48.289
 back and all the rest of the hair 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:50.269
 the waves will go forward and once 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:53.020
 that I have everything marked I will stir 

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:56.650
 with the hand dryer 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.610
 and then I'll go placing 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:05.120
 little by little 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:07.219
 so you can see the result I hope that 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.990
 I liked that you have learned 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:11.120
 now to be able to differentiate what is 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.070
 really a bath of color that is going away 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.890
 to go with the washes 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.160
 a colored bath that may be left 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:23.860
 so nothing root hope I have been 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.860
 help and see you soon see you later
