00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.270 

makes<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> easier<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.100> although

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
makes it easier so you can see although

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
makes it easier so you can see although
she<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.240> crazy<00:01:39.390> flip<00:01:39.659> attacks<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
she is like doing crazy flip attacks so

she is like doing crazy flip attacks so
I<00:01:40.200> guess<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> pretty<00:01:40.650> obvious<00:01:41.009> whip<00:01:41.159> attacks

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I guess it's pretty obvious whip attacks

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
I guess it's pretty obvious whip attacks
are<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.119> ones<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.750> hurting<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.049> the

are the ones that are hurting me the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.030 
are the ones that are hurting me the
most

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
most

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.960 
most
