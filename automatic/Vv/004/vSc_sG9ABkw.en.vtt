00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.960
 welcome everyone with you hebrew to new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 release of virtual reality game ryse 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.330
 son of rome 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 to understand that it is a dynamic 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 sufficiently active but monotonous 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.170
 slasher is also very closely related to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.720
 imperial period of the history of Rome therefore 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.900
 successfully drops our transmission but let's start 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.610
 we are not with the identity of events this time 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.760
 around the legend based on which 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.219
 keeps the whole plot of the game ryse damage itself 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.770
 In the story of the game there is a legend about 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.900
 before he could the great Roman Gen. Do 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.840
 who died in battle being betrayed 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.400
 their fellows other generals 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 seeing this goddess nemesis returns 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.630
 him to the ground in the guise of a black centurion 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 who prey on all the generals 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.610
 traitors as a sign of this now all 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.829
 Roman generals wears a dagger with 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 the symbol of the ladies about to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 remember what will happen to them if they 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 suddenly give them quite interesting 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 beautiful such a legend but she has little 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 common with real 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.610
 legend oh yes could a real legend be up 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.189
 could i call such a house 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.310
 approximate Syracuse tyrant and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.820
 Dionysius ruler 1 I will give about every way 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 always aim your ruler for what 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.340
 he lives in luxury, and nothing 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.510
 needs thus a morgue shield to count 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 yourself with the following of people once 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.970
 Dionysius invited there near the feast where 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 dressed in royal clothes ordered 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 his servants converge with him on the royal 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.010
 strongly favored him she is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.010
 some time there about saw that on 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.080
 it hangs a horsehair sword and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.420
 any moment can break and fall on 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.840
 him in this way dionysius showed him 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.590
 that over any tyrant as it were 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 auspiciously calm not 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 felt like he didn't 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 used luxury items always 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.470
 over it hangs a certain threat and in 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.840
 any moment all this can stop 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.460
 here and so looks like a legend home wedge 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.229
 far enough from the legend of 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.820
 games and in general has no relation 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.860
 to the roman period 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.770
 but nevertheless quite possibly of course 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 what is this simple name coincidence 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.840
 but no less certain associations 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.100
 arise further I would like to draw 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.610
 attention to great work 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.260
 designers of the authors of the game in general, all 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.190
 done quite well clear that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.770
 they need to make the game as possible 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 more beautiful more beautiful but at the same time 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 some things are striking 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.380
 for example such as active very 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 the use of purple with 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.150
 what is the historical purple color 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.100
 the thing is quite expensive thing is that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.000
 getting it very expensive 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.260
 and including in rome the purple color could 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.810
 worn had the right to wear only 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.330
 emperor senators violence tunics with 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.470
 the purple stripe is broad for some 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.959
 Information is still some social 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.989
 classes had the right to wear bands on 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.030
 already here for everyone else is purple 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.760
 the color was forbidden it to this day 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.610
 considered the color of kings if you pay 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.040
 attention to most monarchs clothes 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.510
 include exactly purple color so 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.540
 way active use in 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.920
 some huge incomprehensible tapestries in 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.049
 constant use in tunics 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.790
 soldiers and so on in many very 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.600
 places some doubt 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.700
 concerns that this color 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.070
 just could not have been so much in ancient 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.489
 Rome is all who know him the price of general 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.720
 well pay attention to it easier 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.650
 The entourage in the game is done enough 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.329
 not bad 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.860
 segmental armor in which 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.260
 the paid Romans really had 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.760
 large spread at that time though 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 in some way not considered classics 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.900
 thatâ€™s what Romans are all about 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.440
 soldiers in some cases they are somewhat 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.640
 embellished but in general everything is true 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.489
 sometimes strange 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.489
 symbols on the accounts of officers and various 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.410
 exhibitions of high ranking romans though 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.120
 in fact on all accounts 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.890
 Roman legions were depicted 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200
 specific characters for each region 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 he was his whole 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.319
 symbolism is really present in 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 Most legionnaires although she a bit 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.300
 not that these regions had other signs 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.230
 but this is the little things in general to do everything 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.410
 pretty good 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.080
 as for the organization and types of troops 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.150
 here, too, the presence of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.760
 archers in the composition of the Roman legions 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.440
 armies actually with the Roman legions 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.419
 always went auxiliary troops in 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.459
 which most often attended velit 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.760
 and this is light infantry armed 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.710
 slingers also used slingers 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.860
 in some cases archers are mercenaries 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.250
 For example, from Crit who used 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.350
 the glory of good archers very capable 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.750
 but as part of the legions of archers in the composition 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.570
 regions archers never entered they 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.630
 did not wear segmental armor as this 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.550
 shown in the game and ultimately in 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.190
 the composition of the legions looks enough 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.810
 strange when we see in the game often 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.540
 the use of archers in just such 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.630
 as regards the emperor himself 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.400
 Nero here too everything is not so smooth 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.919
 He is shown in the game what chubby 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.110
 old man despite the fact that in fact nero 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.150
 died at the age of 30 and had to 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.669
 look much younger she is to him 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.130
 we'll come back bohs in the game shown 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.139
 very beautiful and spectacular apparently in the year 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.600
 gameplay however not too realistic 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.669
 for the roman army the fact is that all 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.560
 constructions in the roman army were created 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.950
 not for the parades they actually participated in 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.470
 the battle 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.400
 it is thanks to them that they were often defeated. 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.330
 wins if roman 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.190
 building fell apart right away 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.190
 crime to battle it happens in the game 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.780
 and all the men that have scattered than not 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.570
 differs all other armies with which 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.950
 they fought and there was no such effect 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.990
 would thus roman roman legions 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.940
 fought in the ranks as long as they 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.919
 as far as possible they could 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.349
 thanks to this their not infantry was so 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.120
 extremely effective nothing to me 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.190
 managed to find about the main character 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.410
 games mori mori enough 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.510
 common name in the Roman Empire 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.030
 but however well known 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.110
 commander with that name in foreseeable 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.270
 period no 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.440
 there was a great commander gai mari 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.940
 but in the second century 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.280
 BC that far enough from 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750
 game events but everything is possible therefore 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.230
 most likely Maria is fictional 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.290
 character 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.710
 as for vitalio on commander 14 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.120
 the legion here is all a little harder 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.100
 he is primarily involved in 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.660
 the invasion of britain which was forty 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.430
 third year no rum by the way at this time 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.820
 was only 6 years old in fact 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.010
 the invasion was led by the emperor Claudius 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.580
 although it is not specified in the game and somehow 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.650
 very jumbled scene intrusions 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.840
 led about wow swimmers one of 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.400
 commanders of the legion of the second legion was 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.400
 Vespasian the future emperor 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.580
 also commanded 14 on the region I find out 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.380
 failed but avito leone nothing 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.610
 it is said therefore i guess that same 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.890
 fictional character 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.420
 although if you suddenly have risks 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.970
 other information write in the comments 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.830
 it will be interesting that way in the game we 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.230
 see some jumble 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.190
 historical facts and fictions and 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.900
 historical dates when everything happened i 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.360
 I understand that it's important for developers to create 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.810
 interesting gameplay interesting plot for 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.050
 games 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.230
 but no matter what anyway 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.450
 games are based on historical events 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.680
 still carry a certain historical 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.770
 overtones and really would not want to 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.870
 they mislead users 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.840
 in the next series on the game 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.750
 ryse son of rome we will touch the invasion 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.730
 the romans and in britain the rebellion bows are wild and 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.040
 other historical personages 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.720
 who hit the game from real 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.730
 stories and today it's all thanks 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.260
