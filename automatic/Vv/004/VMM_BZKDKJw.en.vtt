 Andrei janitors today I want 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.149
 as an opportunity to introduce you 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.529
 with a village of tools 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:12.549
 verifiers 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.779
 talent 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.779
 I will tell you 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.779
 a year ago 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.940
 when i was in this cabin 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.399
 May 11 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.619
 in ohh told me that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.619
 they have an idea to make 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.300
 model talent so they came up then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.179
 didn't come up 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.190
 new brand 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 a year ago they were looking for produced 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.380
 good question 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.699
 3 law that could fulfill 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.600
 this order 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.930
 soon found this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 manufacturer and now a year after 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.320
 talk 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.740
 I hold in my hands 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.150
 brand new brand new saxophone 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 strong 1045 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.420
 fans 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.840
 interestingly made club 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 they vat plastic 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.080
 it seems to me very much 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 quite stylish and beautiful 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.580
 same 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 right hands 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.580
 still distinctive 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.350
 I read here this model is decomposed 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.030
 fees 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.270
 up to this plan 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 lower register area 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 on the forum 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.659
 I was told worse 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.440
 however features 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.720
 with double then does not go 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.190
 it is better 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.250
 close the valve and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.330
 need to 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.029
 do not worry 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.599
 breiviku 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.259
 a very long time about that 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.080
 pillows 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.369
 lower cover can cover 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.589
 all tuning 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.619
 forcibly place even 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.499
 some tweak that what have the Czech Republic here 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.469
 here here 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.619
 I see 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.289
 account for the first time 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.469
 some innovations of which but others 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.329
 models from other manufacturers 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 but did not meet 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 we are in many ways new 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.399
 some 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.149
 has long been accustomed to the fact that the lower itself 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.209
 mole 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.649
 as they say yes nonsense 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.049
 us 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.579
 to this is necessary 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.259
 adapt primate 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.809
 fit in 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.369
 source in standard 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.369
 picking simple 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.989
 seems like a salad 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:07.930
 I tried 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.949
 he doesn't need 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.059
 on its 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.219
 on Thursday 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.639
 next time 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.019
 but I do not want today 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.080
 review to play in this state because he 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.169
 help may be worth it 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.109
 as he said 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.799
 20 laws which 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 quantity 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.399
 through return 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.049
 of how he leads 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.219
 in one set 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.869
 but mom 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.039
 don't think 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.379
 Oh well 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.379
 except his for this amount 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.030
 to the quarterfinals 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.289
 sound extraction 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.859
 it seems to me that for 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.319
 that's just for students this 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.719
 tool 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.719
 no effort at all 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.079
 well, there was a goal 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.639
 in the Altai 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.639
 now double 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.949
 exact amount for 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 people who judge ex premiere 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.060
 I can say that he 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060
 bye it's a champion 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.689
 chatted uah 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.710
 parallel to the present 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.199
 nothing from the audience 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.610
 plan 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.199
 what money to find such 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.199
 new tools 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.249
 at work 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.249
 50 dollars 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.249
 in a new composition 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.539
 I think that he and his tools need 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.569
 substances 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.569
 mini 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:18.729
 I wonder what the rack all made by 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:19.770
 to adult 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.150
 in Estonia 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.550
 in the world 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.379
 with the correct body yielded 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.809
 all done 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.079
 Anapa has become a glasses that is, it refers to 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.889
 all table 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.120
 absolutely everyone 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.569
 you used to do that 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.059
 exclusively other professional 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.960
 tool 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.539
 this is the cheapest segment in the rack 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.749
 attractively 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.800
 housing 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.610
 so he is not very 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.830
 reliably 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.559
 person 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:55.119
 thumb 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.889
 still have 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.889
 here minutes 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.919
 interesting 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.919
 loader that is convenient 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.740
 ergonomics here that 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.369
 begins 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.369
 rostrud illuminated 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.150
 that's all cops 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.279
 it means that 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.529
 during 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.460
 capital 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.000
 repair and overhaul can be done without 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.259
 problems in turn 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.009
 this cycle 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.919
 calmly clean 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.449
 I gather brother 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:41.770
 no problem 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.789
 So the problem with CSKA is reduced 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.110
 too will be solved much easier 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.789
 Shchetkin 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.830
 in other models that do not have 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.830
 such an opportunity 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.680
 the good 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.969
 Oh well 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.789
 I can say that this incident 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.789
 cheap cheap 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.800
 very big differences i think that he 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 cheap country 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.180
 competition 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.490
 on low 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.490
 this is just one of 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:27.080
 in the future i 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.379
 from inexpensive 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.379
 Polonsky 

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:37.930
 a little sufficiency 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.930
 Well, Timchenko who 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.110
 We were not allowed to live in peace and forced 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.009
 us 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.309
 learn something new violence 

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:56.460
 true to stay 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.979
 We will see 

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.149
 good luck to all 

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.249
 boss 10 

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:05.539
 socialists 

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:06.900
