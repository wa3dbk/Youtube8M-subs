developers from modern warfare 3 studio

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.750 
developers from modern warfare 3 studio
I<00:02:52.599> mean<00:02:52.959> he<00:02:53.709> they<00:02:53.890> said<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.370> look<00:02:54.609> at

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I mean he they said that they look at

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.670 
I mean he they said that they look at
stuff<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.239> they<00:02:55.629> take<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.989> best<00:02:56.200> parts<00:02:56.470> of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
stuff and they take the best parts of

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.069 
stuff and they take the best parts of
games<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.190> they<00:02:57.519> make<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.819> their<00:02:57.970> own<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.470> I

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
games and they make it their own so I

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.899 
games and they make it their own so I
started<00:03:02.079> thinking<00:03:02.319> about<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.909> Infinity

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
started thinking about this Infinity

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.619 
started thinking about this Infinity
Ward<00:03:04.090> was<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.329> first<00:03:04.569> ones<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.870> do<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.280> there

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
Ward was the first ones to do this there

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.960 
Ward was the first ones to do this there
they<00:03:07.629> are<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.989> original<00:03:08.560> thieves<00:03:08.970> they've

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
they are the original thieves they've

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.140 
they are the original thieves they've
been<00:03:10.090> seized<00:03:10.359> they've<00:03:10.569> been<00:03:10.720> stealing<00:03:11.230> since

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
been seized they've been stealing since

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.710 
been seized they've been stealing since
counter-strike<00:03:13.349> call<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.500> duty<00:03:14.530> 4<00:03:15.720> was

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
counter-strike call of duty 4 was

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.050 
counter-strike call of duty 4 was
counter-strike<00:03:17.519> but<00:03:18.519> when<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.640> went<00:03:18.879> back<00:03:19.000> and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
counter-strike but when I went back and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.559 
counter-strike but when I went back and
play<00:03:19.269> counter-strike<00:03:19.599> it's<00:03:20.049> counter-strike

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
play counter-strike it's counter-strike

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.379 
play counter-strike it's counter-strike
so<00:03:22.569> it's<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:24.069> their<00:03:24.370> version<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.239> game

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
so it's just their version of the game

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.930 
so it's just their version of the game
