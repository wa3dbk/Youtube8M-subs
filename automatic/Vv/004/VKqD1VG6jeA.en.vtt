00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello in this video i want that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.870
 infrared thermometer that is here 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.540
 Amazon is not a special I say 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.070
 sometimes type designation wears imagine 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.400
 that gives it for 16 euros of the haptic 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 is the whole of the optics 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.580
 It's really nice 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 a bit rubberized handle you can 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.679
 handle well here has such a mass button 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 and there are different functions 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.950
 buttons you can choose between 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.840
 fahrenheit and celsius can be a laser 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.329
 to switch with it to see what 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 you can project and do the whole thing 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.379
 Illuminate the battery sitting in here 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.629
 inside of the device you have to here so 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 make a little bit off 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 There is a standard 9 volt 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.300
 battery in it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.390
 which is also included closes and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.549
 on an area aimed at 15 centimeters 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 to 1 meter distance then with the the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.280
 temperature 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 you can see in the video of it now 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 this red laser point is what you need 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.369
 not to measure it just so you can 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.590
 what you know with the thermometer 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.220
 shows that you can aim exactly where you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.040
 measures of the functionary is so that one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.140
 Just press here then it goes on 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.170
 is measured when you let go then considers it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.430
 the temperature last measured this 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 This laser can be used with these 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.990
 I should also turn off the button 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.579
 one because he's back 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.649
 then you can see the display lighting 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.060
 if you have to work in the dark and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.850
 can be between fahrenheit and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
 Celsius back and forth 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.619
 So I have here on the tabletop 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 now measured 23 degrees 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:03.119
 if I measure on my hand 26.5 that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 Fits about with the skin surface now 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.239
 Of course, 31 degrees is always very 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 depending on the respective blood circulation 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.030
 when I here the fingertips times a 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.300
 little 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.700
 was heat so 26 degrees much further 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.840
 I do not think about it 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.630
 I think that's a very good one 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.240
 The device is easy to use 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.140
 does has that was probably ill-will 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.459
 Mist from 50 to minus 50 plus 83 degrees 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.310
 mainz where no human but actually 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.010
 if you need something obviously or 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 It's a good thing elsewhere 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.220
 and just be honest 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.040
 fun to run around and to 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 look at the different things 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.140
 Temperature, for example, have one 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:55.300
 computer monitor has 29 degrees 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.300
 So have fun while eating
