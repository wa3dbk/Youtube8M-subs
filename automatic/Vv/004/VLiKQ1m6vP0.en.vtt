00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel as 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.860
 I do now I have this tip for 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 when they are going to do some short trip or 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.430
 they stay at home with relatives or 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 friends for one or two days and do not want 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
 carry a suitcase because only 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.009
 They will wear a shirt underwear and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.329
 maybe a pair of pants or this is also 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.739
 excellent for when they go to some 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.689
 amusement park and that so 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.340
 generally there are games where they get wet and so 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.259
 They can bring a complete change of clothes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.160
 in a small backpack or in a bag in 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.590
 case of women 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 let's see how to do it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 we take our shirt and extend it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 completely on a flat surface in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 this case a bed but it can be a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 carpet table or on the same floor the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.380
 we bend in a normal way and we put 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.030
 our underwear in the part of the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.920
 shirt collar or in the part of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 above and above the socks or 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
 socks that we are going to take taking 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.840
 note that the part where the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.660
 feet should stay inside the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.309
 Shirt and start now see why 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860
 to wind it as fair as possible to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.059
 that occupies the least possible space 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.070
 here in the middle they can put either a 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.270
 toothbrush rake or some 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.729
 another thing that they think that fits and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 you need since you have rolled it up 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.820
 complete they will take the part of the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 socks or socks that were left 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 outside and fold them in to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.220
 cover the shirt and other things to 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.840
 that they do not fall apart and they have a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 small tube that can be put where 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.940
 be as you can see in the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940
 video 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 we can do exactly what 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 same but with pants that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.420
 have preferably the thin 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.190
 steps will be the same we extend them 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.720
 we put our underwear in the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.400
 top part which in this case is the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.870
 waist of the pants and we put 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.220
 found the socks having 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.440
 careful that the part of the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.150
 spring on the outside we roll as much 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 just as possible and since we do it for 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.200
 full we take the sock for the part 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.729
 of the spring and here I did putting the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 hand to the sock and so it's much more 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.270
 easy to cover it to be able to wrap it and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 everything is tight and I do not know 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 undo and as you see is almost the same as 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.369
 the one on the shirt and it will occupy them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.369
 practically the same space 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.820
 as you could see already knowing this guy 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.770
 You can take a change of clothes 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
 complete for those visits expresses to their 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.250
 friends and family or when they go to 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
 somewhere where they can get dirty or 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 get wet and need a quick change and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.650
 all those who open a backpack very 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.600
 small or in the case of women in 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.220
 the same bag that they always carry and 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.930
 they still have room for everything 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.760
 they need and they will not have to be 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.740
 carrying a suitcase as 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.390
 can appreciate on the screen as well 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.000
 we say in Mexico everything fits in a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.130
 cart knowing how to accommodate 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.320
