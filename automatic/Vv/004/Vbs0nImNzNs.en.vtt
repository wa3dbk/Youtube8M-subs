of potential and Game of Thrones has
three<00:02:21.660> dragons<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> three<00:02:22.830> kind<00:02:23.070> of

about<00:02:27.210> Skyrim<00:02:27.690> too<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.170> think<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.440> was

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
about Skyrim too is it I think it was

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
about Skyrim too is it I think it was
one<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.770> first<00:02:28.980> games<00:02:29.220> where<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.210> didn't

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
one of the first games where you didn't

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.790 
one of the first games where you didn't
necessarily<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.200> follow<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.620> main

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
necessarily have to follow the main

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960 
necessarily have to follow the main
storyline<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.460> could<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.910> go

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
storyline you could just kind of go

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.180 
storyline you could just kind of go
chill<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.620> hit<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.070> a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
chill and you know just like hit on a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.950 
chill and you know just like hit on a
bar<00:02:35.580> wench<00:02:35.850> for<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.210> three<00:02:36.420> hours<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
bar wench for like three hours so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.380 
bar wench for like three hours so
there's<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.440> lot<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.950> explore<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
there's a lot to explore in this

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.030 
there's a lot to explore in this
universe<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.500> does<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> lot

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
universe so I think it does have a lot

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740 
universe so I think it does have a lot
of<00:02:41.070> potential<00:02:41.490> plus<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> facts<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
of potential plus with the facts in the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.150 
of potential plus with the facts in the
way<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.080> do<00:02:43.200> things<00:02:43.380> now<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:44.010> so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
way you can do things now there's so

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.500 
way you can do things now there's so
many<00:02:44.250> stories<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.700> tell<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.030> universe<00:02:45.390> so

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
many stories to tell in this universe so

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.210 
many stories to tell in this universe so
I<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.870> I'd<00:02:45.960> be<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.230> board<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.710> just<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.130> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
I think I'd be on board I just have to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.650 
I think I'd be on board I just have to
crack<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.520> guys<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> proper<00:02:48.540> way

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
crack you guys it's it's the proper way

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
crack you guys it's it's the proper way
to<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.080> scrim<00:02:51.440> movie<00:02:52.440> version<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.800> scrim

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
to say this scrim movie version of scrim

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.740 
to say this scrim movie version of scrim
I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.550> has<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> lot<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.090> potential<00:02:54.540> because

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I think has a lot of potential because

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.360 
I think has a lot of potential because
like<00:02:55.020> he<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.260> said<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.770> long<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.250> don't

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
like he just said as long as they don't

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.070 
like he just said as long as they don't
go<00:02:56.520> Dungeons<00:02:56.970> &amp;<00:02:57.150> Dragons<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.600> Jeremy<00:02:57.959> Irons
