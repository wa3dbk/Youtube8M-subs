just<00:01:40.829> roll<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
just roll that up and then I'm going to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.450 
just roll that up and then I'm going to
twist<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.180> ends<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:50.210> tie<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.960> a

this<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.509> going<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:05.219> go<00:02:06.219> into<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.880> salt<00:02:07.149> this

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
this is going to go into the salt this

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:15.000 
this is going to go into the salt this
is<00:02:07.750> about<00:02:10.019> five<00:02:11.580> pounds<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.700> salt<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.860> about<00:02:14.860> a

is about five pounds of salt and about a
third<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.790> goes<00:02:16.150> into<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.629> bottom<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
third of that goes into the bottom of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.130 
third of that goes into the bottom of
the<00:02:18.000> container<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.480> see<00:02:19.720> there<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.110> the

the container that you see there on the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.240 
the container that you see there on the
left<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.160> done<00:02:25.800> I'm<00:02:26.800> going<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
left once this is done I'm going to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.860 
left once this is done I'm going to
place<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.510> salt<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.780> cover<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
taking five pounds of salt it's probably

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.589 
taking five pounds of salt it's probably
more<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:41.709> about<00:02:41.980> three<00:02:42.340> pounds<00:02:42.940> not<00:02:43.360> not

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599
