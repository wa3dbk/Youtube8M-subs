00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.160
 so hello everyone we are in the car 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.490
 subaru outback 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.490
 2008 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:20.510
 and we will connect the auto scanner 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.510
 multibrand name is his legs sitting 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.369
 He tells them to d802 sous bathhouse 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.739
 so autoscanner was just minutes 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.070
 twenty back 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.040
 updated and part of the menu Russified 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.320
 some brands of cars for 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.510
 Some will be interesting and useful. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:49.510
 video and so the car turned off now 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 connection 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.680
 I saw 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.469
 connector earned 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.590
 caught 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.979
 rumors that we do turn on the ignition 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.979
 but do not start choose 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:39.450
 we remove asia we play subaru 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.229
 data is being processed so choose 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.229
 autoscan 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.100
 scan all systems 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.210
 so I see that did not shine 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.800
 write no errors in russified but not 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.800
 everything 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.430
 move me the transmission no errors 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.430
 no brake airbag 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.579
 and so we go camping and that we have 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:05.349
 the body system 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.859
 the engine of your transmission horse 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.629
 no errors 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:15.200
 brake control no I do not know what unity 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.989
 steam too errors am no errors not 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.609
 error is highlighted in red and their 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:26.620
 quantity so but in principle you need 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:34.150
 press the save button 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:38.379
 all information will be saved ready 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.379
 must keep up 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:50.240
 so I press the left button to exit 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:54.620
 previous menu here we have up 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.620
 control unit that is it 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.620
 separate 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.150
 those 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:03.460
 in which I will be honey you 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:07.409
 substantially purple slightly colored so 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:14.909
 but in principle it is easy to record it 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:18.400
 automotive records saved up 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.789
 what and what rim errors and system to 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.789
 for example 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.680
 off codes found unknown 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:32.229
 monitor monitor or good condition 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.409
 5 min cur 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:43.309
 Enhance it it it it since it's not 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:52.580
 So you need to push machines to Blog 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:58.839
 but 7 block and 9 read codes saved 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:05.439
 Codes do not expect no waiting 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:05.439
 repeating which is often repeated 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.560
 restoration to service control you with 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:15.580
 oxygen that is onboard monitor it 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.449
 and so I suspect 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.449
 girl dashboard 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:36.819
 uranium mode maintained okay so 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:44.169
 we go out principle basically so we go out 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:46.569
 from the menu for the multibrand scanner and all 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.050
 very nice job in the settings that 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:53.219
 there are languages along inversion Russian and 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.499
 polish portuguese italian 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:07:00.449
 Swedish 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:04.319
 British Metric 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:07.059
 beep on and off 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:10.990
 keyboard check will not check 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:13.959
 display and software details 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.249
 ensuring and actually Omsk itself is not 

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:20.819
 so on this for now everyone thanks for writing 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:20.819
