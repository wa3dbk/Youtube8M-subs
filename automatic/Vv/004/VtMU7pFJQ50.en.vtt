00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
or any type of extreme VR system so this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.359 
or any type of extreme VR system so this

is really my first deep drink into VR
and<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.150> also<00:01:12.390> based<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.080> Google<00:01:13.590> cardboard

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and it's also based on Google cardboard

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
and it's also based on Google cardboard
and<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:14.970> expensive<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.950> well<00:01:16.950> I

and it's not very expensive and well I
mean<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.640> probably<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> best

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
