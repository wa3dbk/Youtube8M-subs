Splinter<00:00:07.580> so<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.440> well

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Splinter so what you have to do well

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.980 
Splinter so what you have to do well
this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.099> how<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> got<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:12.000> maybe<00:00:12.450> there's<00:00:12.719> some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
this is how I got it maybe there's some

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.289 
this is how I got it maybe there's some
other<00:00:13.200> ways<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:14.009> people<00:00:14.340> say<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
other ways some people say you have to a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.930 
other ways some people say you have to a
lot<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.990> mean<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.470> place<00:00:16.859> story<00:00:17.369> mode<00:00:17.670> with

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
lot I mean like place story mode with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.870 
lot I mean like place story mode with
all<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.390> characters<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.279> doesn't<00:00:20.760> work

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
all the characters but it doesn't work

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.500 
all the characters but it doesn't work
like<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.359> mean<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.480> work

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
like I mean I don't think it would work

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.580 
like I mean I don't think it would work
that<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> people<00:00:28.500> are

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that way so I think a lot of people are

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
that way so I think a lot of people are
failing<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.760> ha<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.289> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
failing like that but ha this is how I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.770 
failing like that but ha this is how I
got<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> through<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> code<00:00:33.090> by

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
got it I got it through a code by

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
got it I got it through a code by
joining<00:00:34.320> team<00:00:34.559> turtle<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.570> Nickelodeon<00:00:36.570> comm

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they emailed me and I got the code right

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.900 
they emailed me and I got the code right
here<00:00:41.129> um<00:00:42.559> I'm<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> say<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here um I'm just going to say that you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.869 
here um I'm just going to say that you
should<00:00:45.239> join<00:00:45.930> team<00:00:46.320> turtle<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
should join team turtle if you want to
get<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> code<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.219> don't<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.399> think

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
get the code but I don't really think

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
get the code but I don't really think
it's<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.510> idea<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> share<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.829> code

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it's a good idea if I share the code

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
it's a good idea if I share the code
right<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.850> nickel<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> might<00:00:55.170> want
