00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.889
 have been searching for a long time 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.410
 we are waiting to separate what is it in addition 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.290
 young people who had been smoking left 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:26.090
 will have these interventions skate culture 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:28.910
 we had a skatepark and stating 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.660
 what was concrete will ensure a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.980
 super quality 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 of course it's a hit but will be reliable 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.710
 young people will be able to hold by attracting 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.629
 Youth why there's diskettes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.290
 parquet break acquired moment but there of 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 it's a concrete skate park 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.960
 that it would be something 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.330
 different and I think iya 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.070
 gimbrede it's me because there people 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.379
 make nantes 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 soon they will go to lanester but 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.979
 the student your group allowed this 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 what are they going to come from 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.200
 cork was a lot of people this more 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.759
 simple as for their parents by 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 example of getting them to see cannes on 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.810
 wait for it to say that the ramp is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.000
 it actually is finally there is nothing 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.930
 what is called park is especially 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.670
 to make the moon crawl and yeah 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.869
 so it's pretty limited for what for 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 those who do not like too much stuff 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.070
 me for example I do not like doing too much 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 of rent that were in the street 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 often people 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 says to leave what makes noise 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.040
 it's understandable if we had a real 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 trick here meets concrete skate park 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 as there are in some as the year 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.600
 serves the save as built to saint 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.970
 Nazi also soon 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.049
 the cdt knew since May after yeah we 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.580
 move a lot to try to find 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.549
 stuff we often go on nantes 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.549
 reindeer and good structures but what 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.409
 editing is that to the trinity by 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 example before what was especially in 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.500
 on the street and everything and then since 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.390
 that she skatepark d'ecoval here if we have 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.410
 grown up and do not do it somewhere 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.090
 the people they made to complain 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.090
 because we will be discussing among other things 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.709
 but it's also a skillful job 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.680
 that they start low here we do not have 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.379
 a lot what it does not look like 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.989
 start the sketch but at the trinity ya 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.540
 a skate park is a lot of smooth concrete 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.640
 with a few words god it's still happening 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.120
 she has a lot of little ones starting to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.470
 progress 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 good when we have a better 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.549
 structure we progress faster we are 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.329
 best and when we have structures 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.900
 probably not want to skate 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.900
 and it changes everything 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870
 no frankly we expect a real good 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.390
 parent in the corner since we have not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.310
 too much it's more small parts that we 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.569
 is really forced to move that on 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 a year however on reindeer by a 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.569
 skatepark what can we do our 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.689
 little concrete thing with ramp 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.750
 I 'm in Lille and mbolo if that would be 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:17.189
 perfect with good weather bahs 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.900
 kids they do a little bit here by 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.389
 example next to the rollo school but on 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.980
 of the dish and then on the sidewalks to 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.340
 right on the left in the streets between 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.470
 Car 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.120
 and then when he really wants to go to 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.260
 skate park we take them to lanester or 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.130
 an air of vainness filled the car 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 in 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.510
 we call friends phone and and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800
 we leave in a group if there is some 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.300
 thing on wii 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.310
 there would always be time for that it's 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.030
 sure it will not need us to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.690
 to go when it looks like there is 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.690
 really demand
