I do believe this is all I believe it's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
I do believe this is all I believe it's
all<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.460> aesthetics<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.390> hope<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.500> know

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
all just aesthetics I hope I don't know

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
all just aesthetics I hope I don't know
if<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> on

the<00:00:51.180> 64<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:52.020> engine<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.610> believe<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.000> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the 64 bit engine I believe this is just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
the 64 bit engine I believe this is just
as<00:00:54.600> simple<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.320> more<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> an<00:00:55.739> aesthetic

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the game or will be the same game just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
the game or will be the same game just
in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.220> cool-looking<00:01:17.549> package

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in a very very cool-looking package

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.179 
in a very very cool-looking package
that's<00:01:18.900> simply<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.409> trying<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> figure<00:01:19.979> out

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that's simply I'm trying to figure out

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
that's simply I'm trying to figure out
here<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.549> based<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.570> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
here but based on what I see here this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
here but based on what I see here this
is<00:01:22.259> basically<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.130> gonna<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> an

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is basically just gonna be more of an

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.730 
is basically just gonna be more of an
aesthetic<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.439> believe<00:01:25.560> it's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
aesthetic thing actually I believe it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.260 
aesthetic thing actually I believe it's
gonna<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> room<00:01:26.369> inside<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> cartridge

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
gonna have the room inside the cartridge

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.130 
gonna have the room inside the cartridge
you<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> roll<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.049> computer

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you have to roll up to your computer

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
you have to roll up to your computer
that's<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> believe<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.280> gonna<00:01:29.400> work

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that's what I believe it's gonna work

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's what I believe it's gonna work
but<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> fusing<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.780> make

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
but it's kind of fusing they don't make

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.270 
but it's kind of fusing they don't make
it<00:01:31.020> too<00:01:31.140> clear<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> believe

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it too clear here but I do believe

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
it too clear here but I do believe
that's<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.240> gonna<00:01:33.299> work<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.659> overall

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that's how it's gonna work but overall

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.530 
that's how it's gonna work but overall
man<00:01:34.369> it's<00:01:35.369> still<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.210> cool

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
man it's still really really cool

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
man it's still really really cool
because<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.439> obviously<00:01:37.890> banjo<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
because you know obviously banjo or is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
because you know obviously banjo or is
it<00:01:39.030> rezoning<00:01:39.390> its<00:01:39.509> height<00:01:39.720> during<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> n64

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it rezoning its height during the n64

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
it rezoning its height during the n64
