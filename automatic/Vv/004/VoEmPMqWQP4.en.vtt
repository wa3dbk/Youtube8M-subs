00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
really simple we're going to start with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.080 
really simple we're going to start with
just<00:01:20.659> two<00:01:21.659> teaspoons<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> oatmeal<00:01:26.090> it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like a powder basically and I'm making a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.870 
like a powder basically and I'm making a
little<00:01:29.400> extra<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.840> and

little extra just so you can see it and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.390 
little extra just so you can see it and
we're<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.030> add<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> honey

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
we're going to add a little bit of honey

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.179 
we're going to add a little bit of honey
um<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.750> eyeball<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.710> would

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
um just kind of eyeball it I would

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
um just kind of eyeball it I would
probably<00:01:38.430> say<00:01:38.990> maybe<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.380> fourth<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:42.290> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
probably say maybe one fourth of a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.630 
probably say maybe one fourth of a
teaspoon<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.729> again<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.240> eyeball<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
teaspoon but again just eyeball it a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
teaspoon but again just eyeball it a
little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.880> goes<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> long<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.630> definitely

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
little bit goes a long way definitely

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
little bit goes a long way definitely
and<00:01:49.939> then<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> gradually<00:01:52.020> add

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and then you're going to gradually add

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.219 
and then you're going to gradually add
in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> milk<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> maybe<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.750> start<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
in the milk so maybe just start with a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
in the milk so maybe just start with a
couple<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:56.750> teaspoon<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:59.030> then<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.390> um<00:02:00.780> just

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
couple of teaspoon and then just um just

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.969 
couple of teaspoon and then just um just
mix<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> together<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.680> usually
