00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the top of the new one now that's done

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
the top of the new one now that's done
I'm<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> reattach<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.200> Spade

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I'm going to reattach the Spade

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.000 
I'm going to reattach the Spade
connectors<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.540> relevant<00:02:15.540> terminals<00:02:16.230> on

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the side of the motor and we found that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.690 
the side of the motor and we found that
it's<00:02:22.170> actually<00:02:22.500> much<00:02:22.680> easier<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.160> fit<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> new

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it's actually much easier to fit the new

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
it's actually much easier to fit the new
motor<00:02:23.970> upside<00:02:24.630> down<00:02:24.930> into<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> lid<00:02:25.620> rather

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
motor upside down into the lid rather

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
motor upside down into the lid rather
than<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.700> normal<00:02:27.000> way<00:02:27.150> up<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.750> base<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
than the normal way up in the base so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.810
