00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.550
 good orders your channel of maquito 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.330
 talk normally here commenting game 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.160
 the next one that is black ops 2 when 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 on the screen what is the best map 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.680
 said standard 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.410
 only costs the p-57 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 totally with the ballista the sniper that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.669
 finally get it to the golden camouflage 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.140
 today you will see an incredible feat matte 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:32.270
 almost five in a row with the ballista in the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.450
 First 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.610
 In a second 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.340
 and the same as I reappeared 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 here he killed first 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 and killed the second 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.450
 I do not have bad 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.920
 as you can see if you can only 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 play with the ballista 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.370
 I do not know about you but I charge the ballista 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.780
 only at an angle 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.870
 with green the laser the cpu of the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.309
 guarantor or rather the sniper no 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.370
 I know I got used to using only 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.300
 with the mind attack of the laser 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.740
 and the truth works the truth come on me 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.740
 I feel more comfortable using 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.840
 What can I say? 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.690
 commonly true that the ballistic cpu 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.080
 because I really feel that it moves 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.130
 less the smile see with doing that with 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.760
 the cpu spu what it has is that it tends 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.540
 to move a little Balad and goes 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.700
 then you do not get used to that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.500
 if you can like the cpu be very 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.330
 either improve or because if it helps a little 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.330
 but it also helps a little doing 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.590
 do not comment yourself what do you think if 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.409
 they really work 0 works 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.200
 that ballistic perÃº to me really of my 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.020
 part I actually works quite the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.819
 laser as I repeat it again I hope 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.569
 what 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.549
 I really hope it helps a little if 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.620
 you can essentially load the 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.579
 three but consciences for what is the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.260
 quid are rather weeks as the 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.569
 any of three night see first the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.150
 first the first but it does not matter they can 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.299
 load ghost can fit the beach 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 that anyone of any the first 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.340
 the last two if they need 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.919
 automatically that are essential 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.590
 so much the what is strength that 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:47.969
 tends to reduce in the movement of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.859
 weapon and dexterity the skill what I have 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.139
 that also only after giving a 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.829
 long run automatically remains 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.090
 stable in the mine then theory 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.120
 quite and really would help you 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.959
 pretty with that from the sniper 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.879
 when I say comment what they think 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.360
 to you the football player serves 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.510
 you really serve you the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.340
 laser or if you prefer the two truth yes 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.049
 you prefer practically or the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.099
 steel stuck ballistic really not 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.409
 they tried 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.409
 that's if I can use the ballistic cpu and 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.989
 link the truth would have to prove 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.170
 before I can tell you something 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.720
 war 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.720
 but even tell me what they say 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.310
 like it if possible or add the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.060
 crop favorites truth this is a 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.870
 small game 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.019
 I hope you like it 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.709
 meanwhile I continue to behave 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.709
 little is michael 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.500
 it's not just one but he just told me 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.500
 and it is the automatic 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.260
 still not 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.090
 the goal adds the favorites think 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.209
 if it serves the laser or serves that 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.540
 football also thanks the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.540
 next
