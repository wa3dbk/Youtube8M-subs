00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
almost like a time mage so i could cast

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.340 
almost like a time mage so i could cast
slow<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.790> i<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.030> switch<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.780> say<00:01:25.110> use

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
slow then i get switch and then say use

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
slow then i get switch and then say use
elemental<00:01:25.799> magic<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> weaken<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> asst<00:01:26.729> lona
