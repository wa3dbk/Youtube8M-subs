table I thought this is it this is going

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.830 
table I thought this is it this is going
to<00:01:53.470> be<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> start<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.700> my<00:01:55.090> new<00:01:55.119> beginning<00:01:55.659> I've

to be a start of my new beginning I've

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.330 
to be a start of my new beginning I've
got<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.439> something<00:01:56.680> about<00:01:56.829> my<00:01:57.009> weight

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
got to do something about my weight

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.700 
got to do something about my weight
because<00:01:57.729> my<00:01:58.420> body<00:01:58.630> was<00:01:58.780> hanging<00:01:59.290> over<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
because my body was hanging over the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.399 
because my body was hanging over the
edge<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.450> table<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.049> felt<00:02:02.320> really

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
edge of the table and I felt really

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.069 
edge of the table and I felt really
horrible<00:02:03.180> after<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.270> operation<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.930> was

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
horrible after the operation I was

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.469 
horrible after the operation I was
pretty<00:02:05.619> rough<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:06.219> went<00:02:07.060> straight<00:02:07.149> back<00:02:07.450> to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
pretty rough I went straight back to

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.850 
pretty rough I went straight back to
work<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:09.340> was<00:02:09.519> hard<00:02:09.700> work<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.329> I<00:02:10.989> carried

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
work which was hard work but I carried

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.009 
work which was hard work but I carried
on<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.610> decided<00:02:13.299> that<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.630> would<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
on and then I decided that I would go to

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.560 
on and then I decided that I would go to
back<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.739> basics<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.489> went<00:02:15.910> back<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.299> soup

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
back to the basics I went back to soup

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.930 
back to the basics I went back to soup
healthy<00:02:17.290> soups<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.130> had<00:02:18.400> soup<00:02:18.730> for

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
healthy soups so I had soup for

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.470 
healthy soups so I had soup for
breakfast<00:02:19.420> lunch<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.110> supper<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:22.000> made<00:02:22.239> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
breakfast lunch and supper and I made it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.930 
breakfast lunch and supper and I made it
so<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.720> knew<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.199> was<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.560> my<00:02:23.590> soup<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.220> I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so I knew what was in my soup and I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
so I knew what was in my soup and I
started<00:02:25.419> that<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> White<00:02:25.989> started

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
started that and the White started

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.340 
started that and the White started
dropping<00:02:26.650> off<00:02:26.919> big

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
dropping off big

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.640 
dropping off big
time<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.770> felt<00:02:28.490> healthier<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.240> lost<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.050> stone<00:02:30.320> in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
time I felt healthier I lost a stone in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.150 
time I felt healthier I lost a stone in
about<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> month<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.490> then<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.810> gradually<00:02:33.740> built

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
about a month and then I gradually built

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.940 
about a month and then I gradually built
up<00:02:34.310> after<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> soup<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.690> ended<00:02:36.050> up<00:02:36.200> things<00:02:36.710> like
