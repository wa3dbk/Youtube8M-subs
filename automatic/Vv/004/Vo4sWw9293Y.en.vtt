00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.389
 now we are going to move towards the 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.800
 santodomingo farm of the university of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.420
 the Amazon where it has happened is very 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.040
 important synergy between the part of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
 human medicine and the program 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 of Veterinary Medicine 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 our institution where in the company of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.059
 students and professionals have attended 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.059
 a little bit with congenital malformation 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:28.539
 [Music] 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.250
 the veterinary medicine program and 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.630
 zootechnics is engaged in 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.760
 contribute to the development of 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.470
 Amazon region is very important 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.480
 highlight the work of extension that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.160
 made from this accredited program 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:47.440
 of quality before the ministry of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:49.930
 national education this is a small 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.910
 foal and his mother seemingly normal 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.559
 but this little one presents a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.110
 very little congenital malformation 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.700
 frequent in the veterinary field this 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.829
 case has aroused great interest in the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.210
 academic community and it's the challenge 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 professional for today 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.060
 the pathology is a measured crack 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 congenital or what it means that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.970
 both the father and the mother or both 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.940
 may have presented presenting a 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.890
 upset in your on your genetic map the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.000
 term of the pathology or that one 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.560
 the lower jaw at the level of the chin 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.450
 is linked, that is, it is open or 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.720
 whether it was lost has been lost 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 genetically bone continuity so 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.830
 So there's going to be a 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.160
 plate the tongue you have bone life it 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.860
 open two and in turn has some 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.830
 adhesions to the lateral parts of 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.140
 the corresponding portions of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.729
 lower jaw to solve this case 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.200
 of very little incidence in the field 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.110
 veterinarian a team was needed 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 human of excellent qualities 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.470
 conformed by teachers and students of 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 operative technique in addition to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.070
 professionals in the area of ​​surgery 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.130
 maxillofacial in humans in this case 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.590
 due to lack of type experience 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.650
 personal 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.110
 and maxillofacial surgery then it's my 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.860
 support of doctor hugo rafael navarro 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.560
 palencia who is a maxillofacial doctor 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.430
 recognized nationally and internationally 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.870
 the Andreinian doctor who is an intern 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.490
 of the javeriana university and that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.819
 comes from mérida venezuela 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.819
 [Music] 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.920
 [Music] 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 ah 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.020
 everything is ready to start with 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.290
 the surgical act but what is the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.780
 process 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.180
 the anesthetized protocol really is a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.730
 Proportionally simple protocol 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 because we do not have in this is inhaled is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.540
 a pre anesthetic malate pen but 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.629
 which acts as an analgesic as 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.160
 sedative and especially as very relaxing 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.950
 then 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.990
 the soils are placed, that is, the liquids 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.290
 and electrolytes to compensate for the loss 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.080
 of blood in the surgical act and more 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.330
 late is handled according to the conversion 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.270
 a barbiturate as the central point 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.420
 vital and the doctor was helped with a 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.940
 infiltration with lidocaine + epinephrine 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.700
 locally in the area in the lateral area 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.450
 of the incisions is the procedure to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.450
 consist 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.510
 and access to part of the synthesis 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 can help the edges of the synthesis 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.380
 place an osteosynthesis plate for 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.209
 join the two syntheses we will place 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.270
 some wires to make a union in the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.400
 part of the lower incisors and 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.230
 later we are going to sign it he sat 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.490
 mine to join the language on the line 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 half 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.930
 than just one because the typical language and 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.110
 the lips of only one lower side in 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.590
 the part of now yes to what we came 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.590
 let's do it 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:46.300
 [Music] 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:56.399
 when fighting 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.399
 [Music] 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.780
 It was hard work for two hours 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.880
 leaves great knowledge not only for 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.229
 the students but also for those 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.849
 professionals who develop their 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.789
 daily activity in humans in the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.570
 moment when the case was communicated to me 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.570
 of the patient 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.250
 I felt an interest once 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.120
 a lot of expectation to know how 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.719
 we could solve the problem and 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.430
 fortunately all then now the 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.750
 garlic in the most critical part that was coming 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.390
 of care with everyone 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.390
 but but it can excite 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.830
 this is a procedure that represents 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.960
 great economic value due to its complexity 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.400
 In addition to the materials used today 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.500
 thanks to the determined support of 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.289
 professionals and students was achieved 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.909
 perform at this time this little 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.909
 presents a satisfactory recovery
