00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.300 

now<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.290> base<00:01:38.500> for<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.890> puzzle<00:01:39.220> has

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
now that the base for the puzzle has

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.910 
now that the base for the puzzle has
been<00:01:39.520> Katya<00:01:39.910> there's<00:01:40.750> enough<00:01:41.050> room<00:01:41.320> over<00:01:41.470> here

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
been Katya there's enough room over here

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:53.320 
been Katya there's enough room over here
to<00:01:42.250> cut<00:01:42.400> out<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.820> couple<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.180> letters

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.680 

well<00:01:54.330> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> plus<00:01:54.990> side<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.920> definitely<00:01:56.430> fits

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
well on the plus side it definitely fits

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.840 
well on the plus side it definitely fits
but<00:01:57.690> even<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:58.710> far<00:01:59.070> too<00:01:59.100> loose<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.670> me<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
but even that's far too loose for me to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.140 
but even that's far too loose for me to
try<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> justify<00:02:01.430> unfortunately<00:02:02.430> when<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
try and justify unfortunately when I

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.810 
try and justify unfortunately when I
made<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> file<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:04.190> can't<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> inside<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
made the file I can't on the inside of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.050 
made the file I can't on the inside of
my<00:02:06.060> line<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> outside<00:02:07.260> so<00:02:08.060> these

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
my line and not the outside so these

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
my line and not the outside so these
just<00:02:09.420> fit<00:02:10.130> too<00:02:11.130> well<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.420> these<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just fit too well so these go on the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:40.030 
just fit too well so these go on the
rubbish<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:18.180> cut<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.570> new<00:02:18.750> ones

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.030
