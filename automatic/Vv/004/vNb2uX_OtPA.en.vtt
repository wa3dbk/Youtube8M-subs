quicker and I wanted to this is going to

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.930 
quicker and I wanted to this is going to
be<00:04:13.019> fine<00:04:13.340> skeletons<00:04:14.340> are<00:04:14.459> right<00:04:14.640> there<00:04:14.790> for

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
but I think

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.920 
but I think
got<00:04:19.160> enough<00:04:19.460> hogs<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.910> get<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.180> job<00:04:20.360> done<00:04:20.420> we

got a minute left really only have the
one<00:04:23.810> side<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.140> worry<00:04:24.380> about<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.650> widgets<00:04:24.920> are

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
one side to worry about the widgets are

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.520 
one side to worry about the widgets are
going<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.160> take<00:04:25.280> care<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.730> off<00:04:25.880> side<00:04:26.180> here

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
going to take care of the off side here

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.560 
going to take care of the off side here
that<00:04:27.530> king<00:04:27.920> could<00:04:28.370> cause<00:04:28.730> us<00:04:28.910> some<00:04:28.940> problems

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
that king could cause us some problems

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.180 
that king could cause us some problems
but<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.840> kind<00:04:30.140> of<00:04:30.260> don't<00:04:30.410> think<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:30.890> he's<00:04:31.070> going

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
but I kind of don't think so he's going

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.490 
but I kind of don't think so he's going
to<00:04:31.250> come<00:04:31.460> out<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.330> Hogs<00:04:32.510> will<00:04:32.780> probably

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
to come out and the Hogs will probably

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.550 
to come out and the Hogs will probably
wreck<00:04:33.770> him<00:04:34.040> so<00:04:34.310> we'll<00:04:34.430> see<00:04:34.580> what<00:04:34.670> happens<00:04:34.730> here

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
wreck him so we'll see what happens here

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.450 
wreck him so we'll see what happens here
he's<00:04:36.560> going<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.770> be<00:04:36.830> focused<00:04:37.160> on<00:04:37.250> these

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
he's going to be focused on these

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.030 
he's going to be focused on these
Wizards<00:04:37.790> for<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:38.000> moment<00:04:38.470> I'll<00:04:39.470> swipe<00:04:39.740> them<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.710

few<00:04:40.280> times<00:04:40.310> come<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:40.970> over<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.300> meet<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.570> Hogs

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.900 
few times come on over and meet the Hogs
right<00:04:41.990> after<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.320> collector<00:04:42.740> perfect<00:04:43.310> my

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
right after that collector perfect my

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.280 
right after that collector perfect my
other<00:04:44.000> guy<00:04:44.180> jump<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.570> king<00:04:44.780> he's<00:04:45.050> going<00:04:45.230> to

so let's watch the replay see we could

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.680 
so let's watch the replay see we could
have<00:05:19.280> done<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.430> little<00:05:19.580> bit<00:05:19.760> better<00:05:19.940> I'm<00:05:20.330> sure

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
have done a little bit better I'm sure

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
know if I didn't deploy enough hogs what

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.440 
know if I didn't deploy enough hogs what
is<00:05:27.410> fast<00:05:27.650> forward<00:05:27.950> to<00:05:28.010> get<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.250> this<00:05:28.370> point<00:05:28.640> sec

kill and the CC kill was sloppy you know
with<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:31.460> being<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.720> probably<00:05:33.080> should

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
with that being the I probably should

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.990 
with that being the I probably should
have<00:05:33.380> brought<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.620> minion<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.310> dropped<00:05:34.880> it

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
have brought a minion and dropped it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.060 
have brought a minion and dropped it
right<00:05:35.180> on<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.390> gold<00:05:35.870> storage<00:05:36.590> i<00:05:36.710> think<00:05:37.010> i

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
right on that gold storage i think i

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.350 
right on that gold storage i think i

hog which got that heel down in the

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.550 
hog which got that heel down in the
middle<00:06:36.630> had<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:37.720> go<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:37.960> hear<00:06:38.080> that<00:06:38.230> group<00:06:38.410> up

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
middle had to go and hear that group up

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.920 
middle had to go and hear that group up
there<00:06:38.910> yeah<00:06:39.910> I<00:06:40.120> wouldn't<00:06:40.360> really<00:06:40.480> change<00:06:40.600> much

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
there yeah I wouldn't really change much

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.530 
there yeah I wouldn't really change much
on<00:06:41.140> that<00:06:41.290> honestly<00:06:41.980> you<00:06:42.970> know<00:06:43.060> spring<00:06:43.330> traps

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
on that honestly you know spring traps

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.880 
on that honestly you know spring traps
got<00:06:43.750> some<00:06:43.990> but<00:06:44.140> that's<00:06:44.290> going<00:06:44.440> to<00:06:44.500> happen<00:06:44.650> in

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
got some but that's going to happen in

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.430 
got some but that's going to happen in
an<00:06:45.220> auger<00:06:45.460> tack<00:06:45.700> like<00:06:45.880> that<00:06:46.230> will<00:06:47.230> start<00:06:47.380> to

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
an auger tack like that will start to

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.050 
an auger tack like that will start to
fast<00:06:47.650> for<00:06:47.860> they<00:06:48.010> just<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.580> way<00:06:48.670> they<00:06:48.790> pass

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
fast for they just the way they pass

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.640 
fast for they just the way they pass
over<00:06:49.270> that<00:06:49.390> bomb<00:06:49.660> and<00:06:50.050> did<00:06:50.200> that<00:06:50.350> that<00:06:50.470> was

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
over that bomb and did that that was

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.530 
over that bomb and did that that was
perfect<00:06:50.920> I<00:06:51.340> don't<00:06:51.970> know<00:06:52.060> that<00:06:52.180> it<00:06:52.240> would<00:06:52.330> have

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
perfect I don't know that it would have

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.150 
perfect I don't know that it would have
wiped<00:06:53.050> that<00:06:53.230> many<00:06:53.530> out<00:06:53.710> there<00:06:53.740> would<00:06:53.980> be<00:06:54.010> a<00:06:54.100> few

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
wiped that many out there would be a few

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.590 
wiped that many out there would be a few
obviously<00:06:54.700> that<00:06:54.820> would<00:06:54.910> have<00:06:55.000> died<00:06:55.120> there<00:06:55.390> I

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
obviously that would have died there I

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.700 
obviously that would have died there I
guess<00:06:56.020> it<00:06:56.170> could<00:06:56.320> have<00:06:56.350> made<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.620> difference

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
guess it could have made the difference

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.220 
guess it could have made the difference
in<00:06:56.980> the<00:06:57.010> long<00:06:57.220> run<00:06:57.450> but<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:58.750> way<00:06:58.900> we<00:06:59.050> got<00:06:59.200> a

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
in the long run but the way we got a

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.200 
in the long run but the way we got a
little<00:06:59.350> lucky<00:06:59.500> on<00:06:59.770> that<00:06:59.800> it<00:07:00.190> did<00:07:00.850> not<00:07:00.970> trigger

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
little lucky on that it did not trigger

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.820 
little lucky on that it did not trigger
on<00:07:01.390> top<00:07:01.570> of<00:07:01.660> the<00:07:01.750> Hogs<00:07:02.050> of<00:07:02.230> one<00:07:02.350> just<00:07:02.560> triggered

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
on top of the Hogs of one just triggered

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.520 
on top of the Hogs of one just triggered
and<00:07:02.920> they<00:07:02.980> all<00:07:03.130> ran<00:07:03.310> away<00:07:03.460> so<00:07:03.640> perfect<00:07:04.360> job<00:07:04.690> by

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
and they all ran away so perfect job by

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.440 
and they all ran away so perfect job by
the<00:07:05.590> hog<00:07:05.770> was<00:07:05.950> getting<00:07:06.220> lucky<00:07:06.490> and<00:07:06.700> taken<00:07:07.390> out

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
the hog was getting lucky and taken out

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.270 
the hog was getting lucky and taken out
the<00:07:07.630> king<00:07:07.660> there<00:07:07.990> and<00:07:08.260> just<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.650> way<00:07:08.800> he<00:07:09.100> met

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
the king there and just the way he met

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.400 
the king there and just the way he met
