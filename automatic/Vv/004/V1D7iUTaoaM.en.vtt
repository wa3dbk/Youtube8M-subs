00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:23.580
 our work it will be a ladder 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 directly the house itself is made of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.380
 cardboard and now let's take a closer look 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:35.250

 then stand itself claws. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 furniture bolted to the top and bottom 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 screws screwed to the shelf and to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.450

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:36.590
