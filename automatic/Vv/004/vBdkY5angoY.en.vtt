00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.790
Deeper, Deeper, you come into the forest,
pulled in by a voice so sweet.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.360
Come on, Come on, you want to go
even deeper in to meet.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.160
Quickly, Quickly, come as fast as your
little legs can run in the dark.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.490
Come on, Come on, it'll be so fun.
Let's play a game, on your mark!

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.410
This cinnamon stick is a wonderful magic
stick,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
Which can make you imagine you are
drowning in the sweetest of syrups.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.410
Dreams relieve you of your problems and
of the sorrows that make you weep

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.130
Since they are heaven-made,
they have one fall asleep.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.560
But they are only good if
you are surrounded by hallucinations.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.990
When you take the blindfold off,
there are no more pleasant creations.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.560
You will see that your hands are tied and
bound, dragging at my heels.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.180
You've already given up,
don't take it back, it's a deal.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.100
Sometimes, we see a shine of doubt
flickering on the double edged knife.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.990
A faultless love does not exist,
there's no perfect feeling in this life.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.140
Through a hole in the blindfold, there was
something I thought I'd never see.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.770
Lantern shadows that grew at night
unconsciously frightened me. 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.080
My, My, you bad kid. How dare you wake up
so early?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.610
If your blindfold comes off, then should I blind
you instead?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.130
Hey look now, you're laughing, isn't that
the cutest sight?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.800
But you still wear lies, so let's go back to our
play tonight.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.710
"Hey..."
"Give me that...?" 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.320
Why are you trembling in front of me like a
scared little mouse?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.990
Milk is what you want because it made you
comfortable in your home.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.550
This is my domain, it's just as
warm as any place.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.050
I'll just tell what's in your pocket,
now you should not lose any face.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.610
Give me that, quickly, quickly, just give it here
right now.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.180
Don't ask why or when or where, you don't
need to know.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.710
Eat these sweets, they tempt you into
believing fake hospitality.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.160
Give me that, quickly, just give it here right
now.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:46.200
