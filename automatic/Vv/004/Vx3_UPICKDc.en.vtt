00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you you know you start to figure stuff

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.309 
you you know you start to figure stuff
out<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.640> everybody<00:02:00.509> has<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.229> bit

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
out because everybody has a little bit

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.539 
out because everybody has a little bit
of<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.499> different<00:02:01.799> way<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> doing<00:02:02.159> things

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
of a different way of doing things

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
different schools schooling different

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.330 
different schools schooling different
preparations<00:02:05.789> different<00:02:06.409> timing<00:02:07.409> everything

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
preparations different timing everything

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
preparations different timing everything
is<00:02:08.580> different<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.299> it's<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.289> bit

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is different so it's it's a little bit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
is different so it's it's a little bit
over<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.430> walking<00:02:12.090> towards<00:02:12.540> each

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
over just like walking towards each

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.190 
over just like walking towards each
other<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.440> professional<00:02:14.129> way<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.280> just

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
other in a professional way and just

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.839 
other in a professional way and just
little<00:02:16.200> by<00:02:16.379> little<00:02:16.620> trying<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.280> figure<00:02:17.519> things

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
little by little trying to figure things

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.759 
little by little trying to figure things
out<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.390> always<00:02:18.569> becomes<00:02:18.930> an<00:02:19.260> automatic

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
out it always becomes an automatic

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.789 
out it always becomes an automatic
process<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.930> D<00:02:21.930> by<00:02:22.110> day<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.590> gets

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
process because D by day just gets

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.300 
process because D by day just gets
better

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
better

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.490 
better
even<00:02:23.549> without<00:02:23.700> actually<00:02:24.269> thinking<00:02:24.299> exactly<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
even without actually thinking exactly I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.979 
even without actually thinking exactly I
think<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.280> about<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.989> just

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
think it's it's about to do with just

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.960 
think it's it's about to do with just
being<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.590> having<00:02:28.890> patience<00:02:29.579> and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
being there and having patience and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.170 
being there and having patience and
feeling<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.379> it<00:02:34.590> comes<00:02:35.069> more<00:02:35.849> or<00:02:36.000> less

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
feeling and then it comes more or less

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.080 
feeling and then it comes more or less
by<00:02:36.569> itself<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.920> us<00:02:38.099> working

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.150 

you
