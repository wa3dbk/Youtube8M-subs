00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.810
 from north to south there is only one step because 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.069
 as the world moves 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.069

 miss it's all the same north that there 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.050
 will have more sun the explanation 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.119
 is simple that we have a powerful 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.860
 anticyclone on the Scandinavian countries that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.130
 happens gradually on the north of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.360
 country 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.910
 very well indeed we see that 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.200

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.770

 southwest but with fogs towards 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.010
 the Garonne valley is undoubtedly 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.720
 a little more clouds on the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.059
 central massif in the afternoon 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.859
 besides some showers may 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.870
 trigger on said central massif 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.179
