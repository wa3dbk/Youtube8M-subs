00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.109

 with me remember that the first thing that 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.960
 we should do is fine-tune our 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.420
 instrument 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.899
 perfect that sounds in an optimal way 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.879
 to start our our 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.170
 interpretation of the melody then 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.510
 I want you to please listen 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.510

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.510
