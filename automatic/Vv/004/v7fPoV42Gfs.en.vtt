inside the minis frame so let's bring it
in<00:02:42.769> bigger<00:02:43.769> brother<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.609> we<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.209> they

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
in bigger brother here we have that they

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.899 
in bigger brother here we have that they
both<00:02:45.750> look<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:45.989> same<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:47.370> terms<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.700> form

difference<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.389> probably<00:02:54.690> more

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
difference and this is probably more

testament to the iPad air and how much

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.830 
testament to the iPad air and how much
slimmer<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:56.970> lighter<00:02:57.090> they've<00:02:57.420> made<00:02:57.629> this

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
slimmer and lighter they've made this

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.099 
slimmer and lighter they've made this
but<00:02:59.120> you<00:03:00.120> get<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> little<00:03:00.540> bit<00:03:00.659> more<00:03:00.810> screen

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
but you get a little bit more screen

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.660 
but you get a little bit more screen
obviously<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.129> know<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.870> otherwise

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
obviously but you know what otherwise

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.770 
obviously but you know what otherwise
there's<00:03:05.670> very<00:03:05.909> little<00:03:06.060> Tuesda<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.599> choose

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
there's very little Tuesda to choose

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.099 
there's very little Tuesda to choose
between<00:03:06.930> them<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.980> decision<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.549> tough

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
between them so the decision is tough

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.140 
between them so the decision is tough
