00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.799
 the people of youtube how are they but who 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.799
 be well because today I bring you new 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.250
 tutorials on how to download apps 3.4 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.530
 points 7 for this windows 8 that if they are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 subscribers will see that antonio 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.539
 opinions that soft egret also 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
 remember that it is very similar phrase but 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
 it's not as good because not because the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 variable of the game and with this kind of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.470
 record or of the game then record your voice 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.470
 so let's start 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.540
 being 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 Well, the first thing we will do is 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.659
 intermediate fails and they realize that I 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.379
 I had them by series 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:57.189
 but the account was canceled because it makes 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.189
 like 2 mb 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.810
 once downloaded it will be a file of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.090
 winrar right click and extract here 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.790
 we explore an extraction we will give a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.520
 installer we give the right execute 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 as an administrator let's say yes 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.680
 and I want the good guys 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.500
 I accept a heart 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.420
 here look at how very important we have 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 to put in browse because if you do not 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.650
 will install directly from the local 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.270
 we have to program files 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.060
 you have to execute the files of 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.040
 program because if we do not vote that way 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.040
 will keep in the same room 6 will be what 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 following 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 and completed close here is fine 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.110
 we will only execute it and we will give 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.110
 yes 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 and let's wait for them to charge so that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.830
 you see that if we do not have the clue 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.819
 Now I am going to tell you how 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.370
 modify it so they do not get distracted 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.569
 a lot, not just put here 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.160
 everything to the fullest in movies f9 and put here 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.160
 in half 6 and here they tell me I examined it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.740
 record windows 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.080
 sound of windows and compose in stereo 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.410
 and if we wanted to record the voice we give here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.500
 in record external is the webcam that I 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.110
 I have but I no longer want with sound and in 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.200
 screenshot then that does not matter what I want 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.349
 put in jpg movies and well that was it 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.239
 and if we want to record, you just have to 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.760
 minimize the phrase screen to 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.750
 to be able to record and well, but that's 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.140
 all 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.140
