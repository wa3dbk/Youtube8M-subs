 Welcome to pro Arte it is immediately so good and today is the Proma 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.970
 a very special topic and that is about a new tone taker at 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.310
 to find us in the program 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 and that is about the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 The HD 2 pickup would have the Michel and I here in this Blue Ridge 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.300
 you have it installed below the sinkhole 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.210
 and the guitar flat otherwise unchanged the pre shirt of this 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.920
 Pickup it is here 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 Roux in the socket 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.730
 The guitar then has only a 9 volt block attached inside 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
 So you can just plug in cables and get started 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.570
 you're always percent the same now with other two microphones 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.950
 taken off here with two potent five who are very beautiful 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.550
 sound little tip from me 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.210
 and then the same is with the pickup completely naked in the mixer 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 played and from the mixer directly into the camera so we have the summit so 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.950
 nothing changes it with the little ones and it is not 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.200
 Effect in addition so no effective added so completely 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
 dry signal with a bit of stop you could of course still the whole thing 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 beautify 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.700
 yes, have fun listening to it, maybe with headphones that he does 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 Difference as well 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.319
 i hope that being made of fun and being in rheine is the differences too 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:30.840
 hear 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.490
 and he did not find that the hd2 is very very close to a microphone sound 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.110
 Of course, there are always some differences. Pickups now take 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.919
 sometimes done signal completely different than a microphone and the microphone 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.520
 nothing is still going on 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.919
 in the studio a 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.590
 They also make most of the engineers so you can use the guitar 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.240
 Remove microphone 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.840
 but the sharks two as I said is very very close to it 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.850
 in my opinion, closer than some other pickups but that 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.760
 would have to try it yourself go to the shops and tested in the head-to-head with 2 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.100
 Thanks a lot
