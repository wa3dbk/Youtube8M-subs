00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
want really tight security so I'm going

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.160 
want really tight security so I'm going
to<00:02:25.010> go<00:02:25.100> ahead<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.400> select<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.790> free<00:02:26.090> plan

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.860 

and<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:31.130> I'm<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.580> say<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:32.209> CDN<00:02:32.720> I'm

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and then I'm going to say for CDN I'm

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.370 
and then I'm going to say for CDN I'm
going<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.080> do<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.440> safest<00:02:33.950> option<00:02:34.069> and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
going to do the safest option and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.520 
going to do the safest option and
security<00:02:36.380> I'm<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.130> say<00:02:37.250> medium<00:02:37.670> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
security I'm going to say medium and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.020 
security I'm going to say medium and
what<00:02:39.530> these<00:02:39.650> will<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.069> basically<00:02:40.790> with

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
what these will do basically with

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.020 
what these will do basically with
performance<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.500> more<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:43.520> faster

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
performance the more you can get faster

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.850 
performance the more you can get faster
speeds<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:44.720> there's<00:02:45.020> times<00:02:45.410> or<00:02:45.620> certain

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
speeds but there's times or certain

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.229 
speeds but there's times or certain
things<00:02:45.890> won't<00:02:46.250> work<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.489> your<00:02:46.670> site<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.060> it's

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
things won't work on your site so it's

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.420 
things won't work on your site so it's
always<00:02:47.390> best<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:48.080> with<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.739> safest<00:02:49.220> then

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
always best to go with the safest then

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.820 
always best to go with the safest then
maybe<00:02:49.640> try<00:02:49.940> out<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.209> faster<00:02:50.630> ones<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.020> with

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
maybe try out the faster ones and with

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.699 
maybe try out the faster ones and with
security<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:53.569> higher<00:02:53.780> level<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.410> security

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
security the higher level of security

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.220 
security the higher level of security
you<00:02:54.890> have<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:56.420> likely<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.989> have<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
you have the more likely it is to have a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.800 
you have the more likely it is to have a
false<00:02:58.239> blocking<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.360> basically<00:02:59.630> what

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
false blocking so basically what

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.440 
false blocking so basically what
CloudFlare<00:03:00.260> will<00:03:00.440> do<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.739> it'll<00:03:00.920> block<00:03:01.450> people

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
CloudFlare will do is it'll block people

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.820 
CloudFlare will do is it'll block people
who<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.600> things<00:03:02.750> are<00:03:03.019> spamming<00:03:03.380> your<00:03:03.620> site

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
who have things are spamming your site

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.680 
who have things are spamming your site
but<00:03:04.489> sometimes<00:03:04.790> it'll<00:03:04.970> accidentally<00:03:05.480> block

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
but sometimes it'll accidentally block

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.880 
but sometimes it'll accidentally block
people<00:03:05.900> who<00:03:06.110> are<00:03:06.170> actually<00:03:06.319> supposed<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.709> get

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
people who are actually supposed to get

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.259 
people who are actually supposed to get
to<00:03:06.980> your<00:03:07.069> site<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.640> if<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.819> have<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> really

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
to your site so if you have a really

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.240 
to your site so if you have a really
high<00:03:08.390> security<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.350> might<00:03:09.560> block<00:03:09.830> people

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
high security you might block people

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.370 
high security you might block people
that<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.630> want<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.930> actually<00:03:12.140> get<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
that that you want to actually get to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.449 
that that you want to actually get to
your<00:03:12.470> site<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:12.890> that's<00:03:12.950> why<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.310> usually

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
your site so that's why it's usually

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.759 
your site so that's why it's usually
good<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.880> go<00:03:14.000> medium<00:03:14.660> or<00:03:14.810> low<00:03:14.989> but<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.650> you're

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
good to go medium or low but if you're

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.080 
good to go medium or low but if you're
getting<00:03:15.980> more<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.220> more<00:03:16.340> attacks<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.000> might

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
getting more and more attacks and might

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.320 
getting more and more attacks and might
be<00:03:17.180> better<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.420> move<00:03:17.600> higher<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:20.180> can

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
be better to move higher up you can

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.580 
be better to move higher up you can
leave<00:03:20.450> all<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.690> other<00:03:20.720> settings<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.410> same

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
leave all the other settings the same

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.720 
leave all the other settings the same
and<00:03:21.890> click<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.370> continue

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.910 

and<00:03:26.020> finally<00:03:27.020> what<00:03:27.140> we<00:03:27.260> need<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.470> do<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.800> we

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
and finally what we need to do is we

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.220 
and finally what we need to do is we
need<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.190> update<00:03:28.340> our<00:03:28.790> name<00:03:29.180> servers<00:03:29.629> so
