00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
by outlining my nail with the Polish so
it<00:01:10.680> created<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.159> border<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.210> draw<00:01:12.390> the

it created a border and then draw the
heart<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> center<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> filled<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.400> the
