00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
did you know that lard is two-thirds

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.850 
did you know that lard is two-thirds
unsaturated<00:00:24.670> you<00:00:25.670> know<00:00:25.790> butter<00:00:26.029> is<00:00:26.240> 50%

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
unsaturated you know butter is 50%

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.519 
unsaturated you know butter is 50%
saturated<00:00:27.860> and<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:28.759> also<00:00:28.970> has<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.599> lien<00:00:29.930> acid

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
saturated and it also has a lien acid

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.380 
saturated and it also has a lien acid
which<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:30.829> the<00:00:31.099> same<00:00:31.310> thing<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.820> olive<00:00:32.180> oil

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
which is the same thing that olive oil

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
which is the same thing that olive oil
has<00:00:32.630> that<00:00:33.230> helps<00:00:33.590> break<00:00:33.829> down<00:00:34.030> cholesterol

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
has that helps break down cholesterol

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.799 
has that helps break down cholesterol
but<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:37.280> trick<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.730> that<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:38.180> has<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.480> be<00:00:38.600> home

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
but the trick is that it has to be home

rendered<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.010> commercial<00:00:40.550> stuff<00:00:40.880> like<00:00:41.690> this

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
rendered the commercial stuff like this

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.060 
rendered the commercial stuff like this
what's<00:00:42.680> your<00:00:42.920> name<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:44.469> poison<00:00:45.469> well<00:00:45.920> not

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
really but it's very saturated because

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.549 
really but it's very saturated because
in<00:00:48.739> order<00:00:48.859> to<00:00:49.039> get<00:00:49.190> something<00:00:50.079> hard<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:51.440> have

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
in order to get something hard you have

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.489 
in order to get something hard you have
to<00:00:51.679> saturate<00:00:52.219> all<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.519> molecules<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.839> that<00:00:54.019> it

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
to saturate all the molecules so that it

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.160 
to saturate all the molecules so that it
becomes<00:00:54.710> solid<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.210> home<00:00:56.420> burner<00:00:56.719> lard<00:00:56.989> is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
becomes solid so home burner lard is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.840 
becomes solid so home burner lard is
never<00:00:57.440> going<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.679> be<00:00:57.739> solid<00:00:58.070> like<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.699> other

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
never going to be solid like the other

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.239 
never going to be solid like the other
one<00:00:59.089> so<00:00:59.719> it's<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.140> simple<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.620> make<00:01:00.829> ever<00:01:01.039> since

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
one so it's so simple to make ever since

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.639 
one so it's so simple to make ever since
I<00:01:01.429> started<00:01:01.699> doubting<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:03.199> know<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.469> benefits

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
I started doubting you know the benefits

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.530 
I started doubting you know the benefits

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's a little hard to chop if it's room

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.220 
it's a little hard to chop if it's room
temperature<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.800> then<00:01:19.780> just<00:01:20.780> cut<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.140> in

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
temperature and then just cut it in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.200 
temperature and then just cut it in
little<00:01:21.380> cubes<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.190> then<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.060> either

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
little cubes and then you can either

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.630 
little cubes and then you can either
cook<00:01:23.510> it<00:01:23.690> in<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.840> oven<00:01:23.990> at<00:01:24.410> 300<00:01:25.280> degrees<00:01:25.370> for

top of the stove so I can watch it and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.250 
top of the stove so I can watch it and
get<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.070> three<00:01:31.580> stages<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.330> lard<00:01:32.630> one<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.140> them

get the three stages of lard one of them

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.950 
get the three stages of lard one of them
is<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.620> nice<00:01:34.490> clear<00:01:34.910> lard<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.450> second<00:01:35.840> is

is that nice clear lard the second is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.070 
is that nice clear lard the second is
clear<00:01:37.270> intermediate<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.600> last<00:01:38.870> one<00:01:39.050> is

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
clear intermediate and the last one is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.770 
clear intermediate and the last one is
asiento<00:01:39.890> which<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.610> use<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.180> spread<00:01:41.540> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
asiento which you use it to spread and

asiento which you use it to spread and
tortillas<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:42.800> stuff<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.760> you're<00:01:43.910> just<00:01:44.030> going

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
tortillas and stuff so you're just going

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.249 
tortillas and stuff so you're just going
to<00:01:44.300> cut<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:44.750> little<00:01:45.020> squares

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.440 

and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:52.009> we're<00:01:52.820> going<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.000> put<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
and then we're going to put it in the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.679 
and then we're going to put it in the
pen<00:01:57.759> it's<00:01:58.759> going<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.909> take<00:01:59.000> about<00:01:59.210> 50

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
pen it's going to take about 50

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.740 
pen it's going to take about 50
depending<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.259> us<00:02:00.380> defense<00:02:00.740> okay<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:01.610> be<00:02:02.479> very

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
depending on us defense okay so be very

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.330 
depending on us defense okay so be very
very<00:02:02.930> careful<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.039> better<00:02:04.220> if

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
very careful here it's better if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.130 
very careful here it's better if
somebody<00:02:04.640> helps<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.060> you're<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> pour

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
somebody helps you you're going to pour

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
off the fat very very slowly so this

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.580 
off the fat very very slowly so this
first<00:02:11.060> stage<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:13.069> very<00:02:13.400> very<00:02:13.610> pure<00:02:14.090> lard

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
first stage is the very very pure lard

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.740 
first stage is the very very pure lard
very<00:02:15.590> quiet<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.160> clear<00:02:19.209> I've<00:02:20.209> made<00:02:20.480> some

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
very quiet and clear I've made some

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.509 
very quiet and clear I've made some
ahead<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.140> time<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.220> what<00:02:22.370> it's

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
ahead of time and this is what it's

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.750 
ahead of time and this is what it's
going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.790> look<00:02:22.910> like<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.450> very<00:02:24.410> white<00:02:24.799> very

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
going to look like it's very white very
