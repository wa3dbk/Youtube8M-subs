the best because there's like randomness

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.630 
the best because there's like randomness
but<00:02:10.030> that's<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.420> super<00:02:10.780> technical<00:02:11.140> term

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
randomness but anyway so I read it you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.229 
randomness but anyway so I read it you
want<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.120> 5x5<00:02:16.900> space<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.950> did<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.790> 5

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
want a 5x5 space so I did that it's 5

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.550 
want a 5x5 space so I did that it's 5
cross<00:02:19.659> 5<00:02:19.739> up<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:22.329> then<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:23.019> you're<00:02:23.170> supposed

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
cross 5 up and then what you're supposed

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.550 
cross 5 up and then what you're supposed
to<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.829> is<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> read<00:02:25.510> from<00:02:26.079> this<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.530> just

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.929 
put a piece of dirt down in the middle
I'm<00:02:34.000> gonna<00:02:34.120> try<00:02:34.329> it<00:02:36.000> raised<00:02:37.000> up<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:39.069> you

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
I'm gonna try it raised up and then you

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:48.720 
I'm gonna try it raised up and then you
put<00:02:40.689> torches<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:42.569> these<00:02:44.579> ones<00:02:45.579> around<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
put torches on these ones around it and

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.020 
put torches on these ones around it and
then<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:50.109> you<00:02:50.680> plant<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.370> sapling<00:02:51.639> it's

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
then if you plant a sapling it's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.920 
then if you plant a sapling it's
supposedly<00:02:52.480> supposed<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> grow<00:02:53.590> very<00:02:53.829> quickly

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
supposedly supposed to grow very quickly

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.910 
supposedly supposed to grow very quickly
okay<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:55.989> thus<00:02:56.439> far<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:57.189> not<00:03:00.120> burning<00:03:01.920> it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
okay so thus far it's not burning it's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.229 
okay so thus far it's not burning it's
not<00:03:03.129> growing<00:03:03.459> like<00:03:04.950> instantly<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.970> must

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
not growing like instantly so that must

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.119 
not growing like instantly so that must
have<00:03:07.329> been<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.569> myth<00:03:07.870> could<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.439> it<00:03:08.650> will<00:03:08.799> speak

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
have been a myth could be it will speak

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.339 
have been a myth could be it will speak
is<00:03:09.340> probably<00:03:09.730> why<00:03:09.939> I<00:03:09.970> shouldn't<00:03:10.569> make<00:03:10.930> videos

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
is probably why I shouldn't make videos

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.970 
is probably why I shouldn't make videos
so<00:03:11.379> late<00:03:11.889> at<00:03:12.069> night<00:03:13.049> then<00:03:14.049> they<00:03:14.169> proceeded<00:03:14.590> to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
so late at night then they proceeded to

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.030 
so late at night then they proceeded to
wait<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.730> watch<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.569> see<00:03:16.900> what<00:03:17.379> my<00:03:17.620> little

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
wait and watch and see what my little

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.610 
wait and watch and see what my little
tree<00:03:18.430> was<00:03:18.639> doing<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.449> like<00:03:19.629> gardening<00:03:20.440> or

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
tree was doing it's like gardening or

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.409 
tree was doing it's like gardening or
something<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.760> want<00:03:21.970> something<00:03:22.180> to

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
something you just want something to

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.110 
something you just want something to
grow<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.379> guess<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.669> had<00:03:24.849> no<00:03:25.090> idea

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
grow but I guess I really had no idea

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.199 
grow but I guess I really had no idea
how<00:03:25.810> long<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.470> takes<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:27.250> mean<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.730> don't<00:03:27.970> know<00:03:28.120> if

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
how long it takes I mean I don't know if

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.890 
how long it takes I mean I don't know if
anyone<00:03:28.569> else<00:03:28.720> knows<00:03:29.109> how<00:03:29.470> long<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.799> takes<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.900> do

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
anyone else knows how long it takes I do

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.129 
anyone else knows how long it takes I do
not<00:03:32.049> know<00:03:32.319> at<00:03:32.530> all<00:03:33.629> okay<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:34.659> just<00:03:34.750> realized

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
not know at all okay I just realized

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.689 
not know at all okay I just realized
something<00:03:35.349> very<00:03:35.590> important<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.489> there

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
something very important it's that there

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:41.069 
something very important it's that there
needs<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.239> five<00:03:38.879> spaces<00:03:39.879> and<00:03:40.209> from<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
needs to be five spaces and from the

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.530 
needs to be five spaces and from the
sapling<00:03:41.530> which<00:03:41.709> right<00:03:42.010> now<00:03:42.250> there<00:03:43.150> are<00:03:43.359> only

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
sapling which right now there are only

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.140 
sapling which right now there are only
four<00:03:44.199> because<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.769> put<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.099> up<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.579> block<00:03:45.879> so

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
four because I put it up on one block so

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.069 
four because I put it up on one block so
I've<00:03:46.299> got<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> dink<00:03:46.840> down<00:03:47.310> further<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.900> then<00:03:50.049> I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
I've got a dink down further so then I

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.589 
I've got a dink down further so then I
fixed<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.650> hoping<00:03:51.099> that<00:03:51.370> if<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.940> dug<00:03:52.180> down<00:03:52.359> one

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
fixed it hoping that if I dug down one

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.420 
fixed it hoping that if I dug down one
more<00:03:52.750> layer<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.199> suddenly<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.919> tree<00:03:54.190> would

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
more layer that suddenly the tree would

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.780 
more layer that suddenly the tree would
instantly<00:03:55.030> grow<00:03:55.690> but<00:03:56.290> yeah<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.370> guess<00:03:57.549> that's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
instantly grow but yeah I guess that's

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.089 
instantly grow but yeah I guess that's
not<00:03:58.120> really<00:03:58.479> how<00:03:58.659> this<00:03:58.900> works<00:03:59.169> so<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.769> someone

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
not really how this works so can someone

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.189 
not really how this works so can someone
tell<00:04:00.280> me<00:04:00.340> exactly<00:04:00.970> how<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.299> planting<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.139> the

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
tell me exactly how the planting of the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.129 
tell me exactly how the planting of the
tree<00:04:02.590> should<00:04:03.370> go<00:04:03.760> leave<00:04:04.419> a<00:04:04.479> comment<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.019> let

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
tree should go leave a comment and let

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.289 
tree should go leave a comment and let
me<00:04:05.199> know<00:04:05.319> if<00:04:05.799> you've<00:04:05.979> done<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.459> before<00:04:06.639> if<00:04:07.209> it
