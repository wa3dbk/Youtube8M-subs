mean this is like what battlefield
destructibility<00:02:36.450> should<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.379> is

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
destructibility should be this is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470 
destructibility should be this is
completely<00:02:38.040> dynamic<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.819> can<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.120> blow<00:02:39.360> up
