out the other end and voila you have

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.040 
out the other end and voila you have
turned<00:01:54.440> your<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.860> right-side<00:01:55.700> out<00:01:55.960> now<00:01:56.960> you

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
turned your to right-side out now you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.410 
turned your to right-side out now you
use<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.560> chisel<00:01:57.800> point<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.640> poke<00:01:58.910> out<00:01:59.120> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
use the chisel point to poke out the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.780 
use the chisel point to poke out the
corners<00:01:59.660> so<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.500> have<00:02:00.680> my<00:02:00.860> square<00:02:01.160> corner<00:02:01.640> on

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
corners so you have my square corner on

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.680 
corners so you have my square corner on
the<00:02:01.940> end<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:04.100> next<00:02:04.460> step<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.030> iron<00:02:05.270> this

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
the end the next step is to iron this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.980 
the end the next step is to iron this
flap<00:02:08.260> like<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:10.330> now<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> need<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.810> determine
