Minicon<00:00:03.179> air<00:00:03.870> defense<00:00:04.410> team<00:00:04.970> which<00:00:05.970> comprises

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
Minicon air defense team which comprises

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.990 
Minicon air defense team which comprises
of<00:00:07.040> sonar<00:00:08.330> jetstorm<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:10.290> runway<00:00:10.849> you<00:00:11.849> will

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
of sonar jetstorm and runway you will

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.270 
of sonar jetstorm and runway you will
notice<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.960> Energon<00:00:13.740> version

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
notice that this is the Energon version

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.859 
notice that this is the Energon version
of<00:00:15.049> sonar<00:00:16.100> but<00:00:17.100> aside<00:00:17.400> from<00:00:17.600> making<00:00:18.600> some

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
of sonar but aside from making some

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.070 
of sonar but aside from making some
plant<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:20.119> some<00:00:21.119> bits<00:00:21.359> clear<00:00:21.750> plastic

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
plant and some some bits clear plastic

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.230 
plant and some some bits clear plastic
as<00:00:22.500> opposed<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> solid<00:00:23.430> plastic<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
as opposed to solid plastic and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.769 
as opposed to solid plastic and
coloration<00:00:25.170> differences<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.980> basically

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
coloration differences it's basically

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
coloration differences it's basically
the<00:00:27.779> exact<00:00:28.170> same<00:00:28.199> mold<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> armada

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the exact same mold as the armada

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.810 
the exact same mold as the armada
version<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.720> silver<00:00:31.590> bolt<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.520> mean<00:00:32.669> not

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
version of silver bolt and I mean not

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.860 
version of silver bolt and I mean not
silver<00:00:33.180> bolt<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> always<00:00:35.480> confuse<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
silver bolt so now I always confuse the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
silver bolt so now I always confuse the
name<00:00:37.110> silver<00:00:37.590> bolt<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.950> Sona<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.340> guess<00:00:38.550> it's

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
name silver bolt with Sona I guess it's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.479 
name silver bolt with Sona I guess it's
just<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.290> jet<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> starts

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
just because it it's a jet and it starts

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.690 
just because it it's a jet and it starts
with<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.629> know<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.710> it's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
with this and you know it's just a it's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
with this and you know it's just a it's
a<00:00:44.850> sooner<00:00:45.180> looking<00:00:46.020> jet<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.379> guess<00:00:46.680> it's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a sooner looking jet I guess it's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.910 
a sooner looking jet I guess it's
vaguely<00:00:47.190> uh<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.379> don't<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> cause

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
vaguely uh I don't know what the cause

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
vaguely uh I don't know what the cause
it's<00:00:50.190> those<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.300> flat<00:00:51.960> planes<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it's those really really flat planes I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.850 
it's those really really flat planes I
think<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:52.980> call<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> night<00:00:53.640> Hawks<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.500> anyway

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
think they call a night Hawks but anyway

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.209 
think they call a night Hawks but anyway

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you have sonar and robot mode also if

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480

looks dumb but just thought I would put
that<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> wish

main<00:05:11.120> feature<00:05:11.479> though<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.590> they<00:05:12.889> combine

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
to form the star saber I'll start with

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.120 
to form the star saber I'll start with
sonar<00:05:16.729> basically<00:05:17.449> you<00:05:17.599> want<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.870> just<00:05:18.169> extend

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
sonar basically you want to just extend

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.520 
sonar basically you want to just extend
this<00:05:19.430> legs<00:05:19.729> like<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.720> bring<00:05:21.169> off<00:05:21.349> the

this legs like that and bring off the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.920 
this legs like that and bring off the
side<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:22.370> instructions<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.270> most<00:05:23.539> people

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
side the instructions and most people

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.430 
side the instructions and most people
have<00:05:24.110> informed<00:05:25.090> like<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.659> kind<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.169> find

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
have informed like that I kind of find

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.200 
have informed like that I kind of find
it<00:05:27.590> better<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.280> holds<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.639> sword<00:05:29.030> in

place to put them like that then with

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.830 
place to put them like that then with
jetstorm<00:05:34.490> you<00:05:34.699> just<00:05:34.880> want<00:05:35.409> basically<00:05:37.840> push

bar<00:05:42.710> here<00:05:42.949> on<00:05:44.050> some<00:05:48.729> push<00:05:49.729> them<00:05:50.030> right<00:05:52.120> there

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
bar here on some push them right there

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.330 
bar here on some push them right there

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
there it is getting a little bit finicky

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.550 
there it is getting a little bit finicky
just<00:06:01.099> due<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:02.599> the<00:06:02.750> age<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:04.370> name<00:06:04.550> wave

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
just due to the to the age the name wave

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.390 
just due to the to the age the name wave
there<00:06:06.560> you<00:06:06.620> go<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:06.800> want<00:06:07.009> to<00:06:07.070> get<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.250> like

not the greatest sword pretty bulky but
pretty<00:06:25.490> cartoon<00:06:25.909> accurate<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.599> mean<00:06:26.810> other

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
pretty cartoon accurate I mean other

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.320 
pretty cartoon accurate I mean other
than<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.740> fact<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:28.130> they<00:06:28.310> don't<00:06:28.460> have<00:06:29.240> the

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
than the fact that they don't have the

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.950 
than the fact that they don't have the
white<00:06:29.479> light<00:06:29.659> there<00:06:29.840> you<00:06:29.930> go<00:06:30.110> um<00:06:31.780> you<00:06:32.780> won't

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
white light there you go um you won't

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.170 
white light there you go um you won't
get<00:06:33.139> like<00:06:33.320> that<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.800> holds<00:06:34.099> it<00:06:34.219> in<00:06:34.310> a<00:06:34.400> lot<00:06:34.849> lot

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
get like that that holds it in a lot lot

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.300 
get like that that holds it in a lot lot
easier<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:35.900> think<00:06:36.110> it<00:06:36.199> I<00:06:36.529> don't<00:06:37.039> know<00:06:37.130> why

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
easier and I think it I don't know why

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.430 
easier and I think it I don't know why
but<00:06:37.610> it<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:38.029> me

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
but it to me

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.880 
but it to me
looks<00:06:38.770> better<00:06:39.010> like<00:06:40.000> a<00:06:40.060> real<00:06:40.330> sword<00:06:41.110> but

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
looks better like a real sword but

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.290 
looks better like a real sword but
anyway<00:06:43.470> fairly<00:06:44.470> bulky<00:06:45.120> doesn't<00:06:46.120> stay

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
anyway fairly bulky doesn't stay

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.820 
anyway fairly bulky doesn't stay
together<00:06:46.450> very<00:06:46.900> well<00:06:46.990> though<00:06:47.380> I<00:06:47.410> guess<00:06:47.680> you

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
together very well though I guess you

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.590 
together very well though I guess you
could<00:06:48.040> just<00:06:48.070> super<00:06:48.640> glue<00:06:48.820> it<00:06:48.970> into<00:06:49.120> the<00:06:49.300> sword

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
could just super glue it into the sword

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.020 
could just super glue it into the sword
mode<00:06:49.870> if<00:06:50.680> you<00:06:51.070> want<00:06:51.250> and<00:06:51.430> then<00:06:51.520> just<00:06:51.700> took<00:06:51.850> all

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
mode if you want and then just took all

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.140 
mode if you want and then just took all
these<00:06:52.240> pieces<00:06:52.480> off<00:06:52.840> of<00:06:53.020> a<00:06:53.050> jetstorm<00:06:53.970> if<00:06:54.970> you

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
these pieces off of a jetstorm if you

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.840 
these pieces off of a jetstorm if you
wish<00:06:55.330> Benny<00:06:55.570> why<00:06:56.070> pretty<00:06:57.070> nice<00:06:57.250> little<00:06:57.580> sword

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290
