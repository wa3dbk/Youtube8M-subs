00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.180
 I am Carlos Baute 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.519
 this a presentation 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.839
 of cases 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.839
 of orthodontics treated in my office 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.980
 in these photos you see a young 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.289
 with a healthy denture 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.999
 but the sides do not have the correct shape 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.070
 up close you can see that the sides are narrow pointed 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 i like all 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.270
 after a few months of treatment 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 gone plating cosmetics on the sides 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 it looks prettier the denture 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 the smile show normal-sized teeth 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.790
 the photo before and after compared side by side 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.550
 they let see the changes in the appearance of the clients 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.860
 this is a case of a fractured fang below the gum 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.840
 in this angle the damage is better seen 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 not to lose the fang, orthodontics was necessary 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.680
 to get the root out a bit and have something else to grab the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 reconstruction 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.670
 After three months of orthodontics a crown was placed 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.689
 to give the original appearance of a fang again 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.610
 without orthodontics it would not have been possible 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 rebuild the tusk in a strong way and you will see 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.819
 this young woman wanted to close the space between her teeth that had never 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.519
 liked 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.590
 and had increased in size to weight over the years 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.599
 the photo close up 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.469
 lets see not only the space that quite large 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.059
 if not the frenulum that came to start 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.059
 in the area between the teeth 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.699
 after eight months of treatment with index for sale 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.359
 and a small surgery to remove the frenum between the teeth 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.029
 the space is totally closed 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.430
 this photo in only two weeks after surgery that's why you see 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.340
 that the area is a little redder than the rest of the agency 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.949
 with the photos before or after 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.480
 side by side 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 you can see the difference 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.529
 And of course 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.529
 the patient was very happy 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.339
 this is another case that was also only dealt with innes a la ain 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.629
 and the sides 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.819
 they were totally locked behind the bottom teeth 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.840
 At the end of the treatment, the laterals ended in a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.299
 good position and the bite returned to normal 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:51.309
 the before and after pictures show the change produced by orthodontics with 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.309
 investors 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.279
 in this case 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.009
 the plants were rotated 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.669
 and that did 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.989
 that will wear out at an angle 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.669
 in this view you can not see well but when the teeth straighten you will see 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.669
 best 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.879
 at the end of orthodontics 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.889
 also with endesa they see all the teeth were left but you can see the 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.889
 wear caused by bad bite 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.970
 if the patient returned to his country before fixing the spent teeth 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.239
 if he had become a turkey fan in the gallant teeth 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.199
 whether direct or indirect 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.169
 the shape of the two centrals would have been perfect 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.389
 I hope you have found this information 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.559
