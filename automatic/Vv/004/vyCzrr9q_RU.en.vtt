00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530 

the<00:02:41.650> bundles<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.580> side<00:02:42.820> are<00:02:43.090> not<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the bundles on this side are not the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.080 
the bundles on this side are not the
same<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> bundles<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.710> other<00:02:44.830> side<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
same as the bundles on the other side so

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.710 
same as the bundles on the other side so
right<00:02:46.330> now<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.720> only<00:02:46.840> affects<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.620> area<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
right now it only affects this area and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.130 
right now it only affects this area and
it<00:02:49.870> still<00:02:50.110> makes<00:02:50.260> me<00:02:50.500> nervous<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.360> I<00:02:52.390> am<00:02:52.810> going

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
it still makes me nervous so I am going

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.020 
it still makes me nervous so I am going
to<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:55.170> got<00:02:56.170> another<00:02:56.470> strap

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.870 

then<00:02:59.480> I'm<00:02:59.630> gonna<00:03:00.400> well<00:03:01.400> anyway

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.770 

I'm<00:03:04.360> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.930> make<00:03:05.170> attempt<00:03:05.800> my<00:03:06.360> fix<00:03:07.360> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
I'm going to make attempt my fix and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.880 
I'm going to make attempt my fix and
then<00:03:08.380> we'll<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:08.800> either<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.220> go

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
then we'll see either we go

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.809 
then we'll see either we go
so<00:03:12.000> they<00:03:13.000> take<00:03:13.239> 34<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.069> think<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.400> corrected

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
so they take 34 and I think I corrected

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.890 
so they take 34 and I think I corrected
kind<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.599> my<00:03:16.870> problem

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
kind of my problem

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.410 
kind of my problem
so<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> didn't<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:19.920> any<00:03:20.129> tools<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.909> thread

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
so I didn't have any tools to thread

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.550 
so I didn't have any tools to thread

trying to mess with me but the way that

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.399 
trying to mess with me but the way that
curve<00:04:59.909> on<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> top<00:05:00.509> of<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:00.750> plastic<00:05:01.199> band

curve on the top of that plastic band

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.189 
curve on the top of that plastic band
was<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:03.090> just<00:05:03.270> came<00:05:03.389> apart<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:03.990> I'm<00:05:04.080> not

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
sure exactly how these are held together

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.809 
sure exactly how these are held together
but<00:05:08.099> that's<00:05:08.220> what<00:05:08.490> keeps<00:05:08.669> them<00:05:08.970> in<00:05:09.150> there

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
but that's what keeps them in there

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.170 
but that's what keeps them in there
keeps<00:05:11.819> them<00:05:12.030> at<00:05:12.150> their<00:05:12.330> right<00:05:12.539> angles

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
keeps them at their right angles

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.790 
keeps them at their right angles
otherwise<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.949> would<00:05:16.949> be<00:05:16.979> toast<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:19.440> I<00:05:19.530> picked
