I<00:00:31.070> definitely<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.610> cats<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.329> having<00:00:33.660> some

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I definitely like cats to be having some

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
I definitely like cats to be having some
canned<00:00:34.170> food<00:00:34.380> every<00:00:35.100> day<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:36.210> feel<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
canned food every day I do feel that is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
canned food every day I do feel that is
it's<00:00:37.500> closer<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.280> cats<00:00:38.579> would<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.879> eating

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's closer to what cats would be eating

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.750 
it's closer to what cats would be eating
out<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.719> nature<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:41.100> words<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.550> more

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
out in nature in other words it's more

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
out in nature in other words it's more
like<00:00:41.910> canned<00:00:42.210> Mouse<00:00:42.510> high<00:00:43.079> protein<00:00:43.440> low

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like canned Mouse high protein low

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.369 
like canned Mouse high protein low
carbohydrate<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.629> good<00:00:45.840> source<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
carbohydrate and a good source of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.130 
carbohydrate and a good source of
moisture<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.570> especially

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
moisture for them this is especially

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.220 
moisture for them this is especially
important<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.160> our<00:00:50.820> kitties<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.449> older<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
important as our kitties get older and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.220 
important as our kitties get older and
especially<00:00:53.039> important<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.899> cats<00:00:54.899> are

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
especially important if cats are

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
especially important if cats are
suffering<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.890> medical<00:00:56.309> problems<00:00:56.730> any<00:00:57.000> type

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
suffering from medical problems any type

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
suffering from medical problems any type
of<00:00:57.239> urinary<00:00:57.750> disease<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.760> constipation

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
of urinary disease and constipation

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
of urinary disease and constipation
things<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> sort<00:01:00.570> what's<00:01:01.020> really

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
things of that sort what's really

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.460 
things of that sort what's really
important<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.489> well<00:01:02.730> hydrated<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> other

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
important to be well hydrated the other

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
important to be well hydrated the other
nice<00:01:04.710> thing<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:04.979> canned<00:01:05.489> food<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
nice thing about canned food is that it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
nice thing about canned food is that it
is<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.680> lower<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> calories<00:01:08.850> than<00:01:08.880> dry

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is actually lower in calories than dry

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
is actually lower in calories than dry
food<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> which<00:01:10.500> most<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.220> realize

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
food is which most people don't realize

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 
food is which most people don't realize
so<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.110> useful<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.680> cats<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so it can be very useful for cats that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
so it can be very useful for cats that
have<00:01:14.760> overweight<00:01:15.270> problems<00:01:15.810> especially<00:01:16.229> if
