00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 good people that I bring you a new 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 gameplay is about a game of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 domain here on the overflow map 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 playing land war I'm going 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 to get a nuclear medal with 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 this weapon that you are seeing on screen 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.660
 the light machine gun hammer one of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.700
 the best without doubt this is the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.520
 Copts and for me it's my favorite because 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.399
 Russia allows you a tad is not that it's 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.719
 a lightweight light weapon but yes you 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.670
 allows you to move with a little more 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 freedom than the other machine guns 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 light that the exact one that also 48 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 and what a very good weapon you are going to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480
 see a game in which it will cost me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160
 a lot to do in the last casualties 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 much then we see why the and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 then we will analyze but above all it is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 a nuclear that I believe the domain 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.430
 had not climbed any nuclear its way 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 of game that I do not like too much 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.920
 bored a little bit because the enemies 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 they are usually pretty pretty campero 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 they play very tactically depending on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.399
 objectives and that bores me because look 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.049
 like especially when there are clouds in the 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.759
 air you see that the wording drafters the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.750
 answer the flag for example before 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.610
 now 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.190
 and they were covering the flag not 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
 try to advance stay especially if 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.080
 you are taking a little review of them 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.750
 they are to medrÃ¡n intimidated there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.190
 in the flag without moving and leaving 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.900
 it becomes even boring because it is 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.910
 just go for it that flag and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.500
 They remain in positions where you have them 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.380
 What disadvantages usually kill you? 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.690
 they are always putting looks and I do not know is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.300
 a game mode that the truth does not not me 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.490
 too much fun plus backing 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.170
 change one in a brutal way in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060
 how much do you spend the border of the flag of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.800
 his and as it happened in modern 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 warfare 3 is to let the enemies a 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.119
 flag dominate you the other 2 is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.649
 the best strategy because that's how you win the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 heading you want controlled the backup 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.040
 It is known that if you had three flags, 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.410
 enemies can appear by any 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.690
 side that is an authentic madness and a 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.220
 Authentic suicide because without clouds 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.649
 the air without uvb grape 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.840
 it's very complicated to survive that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.300
 because look at the rest and bastard who is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.370
 Look, we have the three flags and look 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 where you need reappearing all the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.900
 team is respawn will give me great 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 part of the nuclear because practically 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 not going 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.050
 and it does not vary because my colleagues are 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.239
 repulsing the responders 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.099
 in the air way of the flag of ce 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.620
 that are much clearer than this 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.930
 this of the flag of the zone of works 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.209
 As we usually call it, it is a 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.790
 a little more complicated because you can 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.819
 go out where the boats have stuck to the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.260
 work is complicated to be there without you 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.030
 mates and have four or five of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.890
 blows on him especially here in 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.080
 terrestrial war that is an authentic 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.640
 madness and nine enemies again at 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.440
 beginning then they are falling the truth 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 According to what they were checking, seeing that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.650
 they can do nothing but at the beginning that 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.810
 there are a lot of them and they are all 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.340
 enemies in the in the game is a 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 authentic some good look at this 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.920
 moment that file or do not kill me 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.560
 miracle has seen that attempt of c4 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.150
 failed happens to me many times because it is 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.970
 the bad of being used to taking you 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.890
 4 is good 4 is also bad because 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.330
 I only wear 1 or is normal with almost 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.459
 we all only carry 11 4 did not wear 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.780
 double lethal and there are times that I get to 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.489
 throw it away I do not remember that I've already 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.560
 thrown away I think I caught some little bag 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.630
 of the ground and the instinct of that of spear 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 of c4 instead of shooting and sometimes 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.010
 you make that little file 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.690
 of 24 with a face of asshole when 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.549
 you cut a nuclear rancid by this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.069
 stupid bug but well there I had a lot 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.470
 lucky and they did not kill me good like what 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.080
 said this endorsement is going to give much 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.510
 of the nuclear because it repeats a lot and 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.160
 in land warfare even if you're 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.049
 stuck in it responds enemy as they are 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.519
 So many enemies does not vary they have to be 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.470
 two or three of your companions those who 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.110
 you are involved so that this is a 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.549
 little bit not quite sure it's not 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.340
 they will reappear there good 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.230
 You have seen the bulletproof vest as 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.690
 it works like that grenade if it does not carry 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.160
 wearing the vest they kill me for that now 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.470
 lately when I play some time without 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.480
 vest is that I feel let's go as if 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.459
 I did not know how to play because the stars 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.440
 explosions in this game are hyper 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.019
 mega ancheta gives if you die with anything with 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.459
 an incredible facility and I do not know how 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.200
 people can play without a chalet with their 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.299
 tactical mask because when you 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.760
 you get used to it I swear it is very 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.639
 difficult to return to the previous thing to play without 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.979
 it here as you see already has a streak 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.720
 quite pretty important and it's 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.289
 implacable and you are going to say what is going to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.530
 Cost 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.780
 especially in the second round 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.610
 and now 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.590
 to the nuclear set the amount of 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.889
 assists that I do not reach the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.840
 enemies is an authentic pass because 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.160
 is what I say good let's go to 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.750
 continue with the second part of the 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.060
 gameplay that we are going to analyze because what 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.919
 I get before the nuclear begins the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.080
 second round and I had very little left 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.580
 for nuclear, we'll see what is 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 in getting the nuclear this second 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.790
 ship is spectacular but before that 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.730
 I wanted to tell you about the accessories that 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.100
 I had in the hummer I carry the butt the 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.200
 enlarged charger and in the laser sight already 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.850
 you know the butt and the loader 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.230
 expanded is practically mandatory in 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.090
 all the light shrapnel as well as 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.130
 you saw in the nuclear that was located in 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.919
 the mega 48 with the sat that I wear it 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.630
 always and the laser sight here I put it 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.250
 to the hummer to be able a little more to 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.810
 I sack for the enemies and have a little 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.210
 more confident when I approach 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.490
 them and when firing from the hip to 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.560
 power a little more to the body 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.910
 with a little more security but 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.919
 also that this weapon is doing very well 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.930
 The muffler is undoubtedly the 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.050
 light arteries that I like the most and 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.330
 especially because this and the ls w are the 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.920
 two light machine guns that recharge 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.450
 faster because 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.390
 this drum loader that you see that 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.970
 when you charge, it takes a lot less than 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.500
 shatila ele those two machine guns m48 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.200
 took an awful lot and is as 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.750
 You see when I charge late I know 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.400
 like twice a refill of a rifle 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.800
 of assault pretty much a little bit more is 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.840
 very good because that makes you not want 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.460
 so much time and always have ammunition to 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.750
 your disposition the bad thing is that the 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.580
 charger employee only carries 100 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.930
 bullets but good are 100 bullets are 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.240
 many bullets compared to a 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.250
 submachine gun a rifle assaults are quite 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.290
 with what it gives you to kill easily 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.060
 78 enemies without having to recharge if 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.030
 you have is quite accurate and you know 2 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.110
 mean the bullets well you see that 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.360
 I have the brutal brutal streak and you will say 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.070
 wow until nuclear out nothing in 30 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.920
 second hundreds or 300 friends of the 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.840
 charges then you will not go seeing how it goes 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.450
 to cost a lot to get the 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.130
 last casualties among other things because 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.440
 there is a helicopter a helicopter in the 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.600
 air a crop is going to remove this 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.630
 low that you are going to see now incredible was 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.730
 mine already and it beats me later when I 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.680
 I approach for others as my colleagues are 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.289
 also some vultures not 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.060
 do not even notice how I'm running around 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.380
 side for another with less more than I have 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.180
 Lumen Sale can guide me because if 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.889
 it's not that in the end what usually happens 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.780
 I'm going to be hot I answer because I'm going 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.120
 with the anxiety that I lack little 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.039
 to nuclear and I end up killing because 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.870
 You are going to say that a power does not come 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.550
 that did not arrive that they take them from me and you go to 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.650
 realizing more and more and more and 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.990
 you run out of nuclear without a run and everything 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.240
 the work of the game ends up in 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.889
 nothing because of the anxiety that 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.080
 that you have to go fast through the straw like that 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.130
 that you do not arrive and you see that you are doing 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.990
 assists that you have very little left 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.460
 for the nuclear and does not get it that 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.530
 it happens a lot very much very much 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.610
 many times more than you think if 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.449
 not this bank gave many 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.250
 nuclear 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.110
 for this reason that's why it's good 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.940
 play with good people but if you do not 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.130
 you agree with the truth that you do not arrive 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.050
 to the downside if you get screwed many times of 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.539
 what's good here and finally find 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.759
 a backup and look what happens to me in 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.169
 the discharge of the nuclear I charge it and look 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.849
 what I say to you, you go with all the anxiety 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.310
 are you going to replicate and look if I get to 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.710
 kill the sniper before I do not get it if 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.120
 have me shoot before luck what 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.060
 I always aim for luck I have 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.750
 good luck and nuclear will continue with the a 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.000
 watch 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.590
 I have already raised three nuclear 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.870
 light metric is in the third os 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.000

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.950
 last I have to go up and nothing 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.600
