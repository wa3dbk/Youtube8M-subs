transition from the down motion that's
the<00:04:50.180> basic<00:04:50.540> movement<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.260> be<00:04:51.470> careful<00:04:51.950> there

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
the basic movement but be careful there

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.250 
the basic movement but be careful there
are<00:04:52.580> lots<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:52.970> ways<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.510> diminish<00:04:53.960> the
