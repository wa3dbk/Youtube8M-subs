00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
well in both the driver it fairway some

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.529 
well in both the driver it fairway some
slight<00:00:19.529> differences<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> technology<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
slight differences in the technology the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.630 
slight differences in the technology the
next<00:00:22.320> core<00:00:22.560> face<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.070> we've<00:00:23.250> seen<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
next core face which we've seen in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
last two or three years worth for Nike
drivers<00:00:25.769> been<00:00:26.220> updated<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.090> should<00:00:27.300> see

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
drivers been updated so you should see

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
drivers been updated so you should see
some<00:00:27.510> faster<00:00:28.140> ball<00:00:28.320> speeds<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> fly

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
some faster ball speeds and also the fly

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.460 
some faster ball speeds and also the fly
brakes<00:00:30.300> technology<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
brakes technology that we see in the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
brakes technology that we see in the
back<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> head<00:00:32.099> now<00:00:32.309> that's<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.120> there

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
back of the head now that's really there

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600 
back of the head now that's really there
again<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.350> increase<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.950> transfer<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> energy

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
again to increase the transfer of energy

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
again to increase the transfer of energy
through<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> club<00:00:36.809> head<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.649> keep<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
through the club head and also keep it a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
through the club head and also keep it a
bit<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.340> stable<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.120> not<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:39.930> we

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
bit more stable so not only should we

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
bit more stable so not only should we
see<00:00:40.320> these<00:00:40.530> clubs<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.129> further<00:00:41.460> but

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
see these clubs going a bit further but

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400 
see these clubs going a bit further but
also<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.840> accurately<00:00:43.260> as

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
also a little bit more accurately as

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.750 
also a little bit more accurately as
well<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> test<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
well we're going to test them on the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
well we're going to test them on the
track<00:00:44.969> man<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> using<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> new<00:00:46.500> resin

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
track man and using the new resin

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
track man and using the new resin
platinum<00:00:47.760> golf<00:00:47.969> ball<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.750> you'll<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.110> get

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
platinum golf ball so you'll really get

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
platinum golf ball so you'll really get
a<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.500> idea<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.920> how<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> mikey<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a good idea of how a mikey is going to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
a good idea of how a mikey is going to
perform<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> season

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.030 

so<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:00.989> we've<00:01:01.140> hit<00:01:01.260> both<00:01:01.410> models<00:01:01.770> let's<00:01:01.860> have

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
so now we've hit both models let's have

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.619 
so now we've hit both models let's have
a<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.059> numbers<00:01:03.420> from<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a bit of a look at the numbers from the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
a bit of a look at the numbers from the
track<00:01:03.960> man<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.470> first<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.190> all<00:01:05.250> looking<00:01:05.519> at

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
track man so first of all looking at

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390 
track man so first of all looking at
ball<00:01:05.790> speed<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> bottom

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
ball speed we can see that at the bottom

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.910 
ball speed we can see that at the bottom
line<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:09.000> 165<00:01:09.840> miles<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.290> hour<00:01:10.410> that's<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
line there 165 miles an hour that's the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.060 
line there 165 miles an hour that's the
that's<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.550> covert<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.570> tour<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.200> because

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that's the covert to tour and because

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.440 
that's the covert to tour and because
see<00:01:14.160> that's<00:01:14.190> coming<00:01:14.580> off<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> face<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.240> ever

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
see that's coming off the face just ever

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
see that's coming off the face just ever
so<00:01:15.660> slightly<00:01:15.690> quicker<00:01:16.290> than<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so slightly quicker than and the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.790 
so slightly quicker than and the
previous<00:01:17.970> model<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.900> I've<00:01:19.050> used<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> top

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
previous model that I've used at the top

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.320 
previous model that I've used at the top
there<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.190> my<00:01:20.369> driver<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.000> using<00:01:21.210> at

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
there that's my driver that I'm using at

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
there that's my driver that I'm using at
the<00:01:21.390> moment<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.990> used<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> same<00:01:22.530> shaft<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the moment I've used the same shaft in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
the moment I've used the same shaft in
all<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.759> clubs<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.450> set<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.990> nine

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
all three of these clubs all set at nine

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.400 
all three of these clubs all set at nine
and<00:01:25.440> a<00:01:25.470> half<00:01:25.500> degrees<00:01:26.160> and<00:01:27.110> obviously<00:01:28.110> looking

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
and a half degrees and obviously looking

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.389 
and a half degrees and obviously looking
at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> numbers<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.039> we<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
at the numbers there we can see the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.100 
at the numbers there we can see the
spins<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:29.789> low<00:01:30.180> can't<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:31.020> new

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
spins very low can't we on the new

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.430 
spins very low can't we on the new
coverts<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> bottom<00:01:32.160> line<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:33.440> so

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
coverts or on that bottom line there so

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.109 
coverts or on that bottom line there so
i<00:01:34.470> probably<00:01:34.920> need<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.910> bit<00:01:36.000> more

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
i probably need need a little bit more

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.109 
i probably need need a little bit more
loft<00:01:36.420> maybe<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.960> chef<00:01:37.229> that's<00:01:37.410> not<00:01:37.590> quite<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.039> a

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
loft maybe a chef that's not quite as a

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.100 
loft maybe a chef that's not quite as a
low<00:01:39.119> spin<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.990> 1i<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.410> as<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:42.110> distance

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
low spin as the 1i have as well distance

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
low spin as the 1i have as well distance
is<00:01:43.320> obviously<00:01:44.250> slightly<00:01:44.700> further<00:01:44.940> with<00:01:45.300> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
is obviously slightly further with with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.609 
is obviously slightly further with with
my<00:01:45.720> own<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.050> moment<00:01:46.080> which<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
my own at the moment which is the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
my own at the moment which is the
current<00:01:46.950> covert<00:01:47.369> tour<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.910> think<00:01:48.119> it's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
current covert tour but I think it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240 
current covert tour but I think it's
just<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> case<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.800> just<00:01:49.950> getting<00:01:50.190> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
just a case of actually just getting the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.200 
just a case of actually just getting the
club<00:01:50.460> set<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.850> properly<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.509> me<00:01:51.690> really<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
club set up properly for me really and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
club set up properly for me really and
covert<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> performance<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.289> middle

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
covert to performance there the middle

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.890 
covert to performance there the middle
line<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.369> again<00:01:57.119> good<00:01:57.360> ball<00:01:57.570> speed

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
line we can see again good ball speed

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.630 
line we can see again good ball speed
slightly<00:01:58.350> too<00:01:58.470> much<00:01:58.650> spin<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.159> myself<00:01:59.490> which

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
slightly too much spin for myself which

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
slightly too much spin for myself which
is<00:01:59.700> obviously<00:02:00.090> impacted<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is obviously impacted a little bit on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
is obviously impacted a little bit on
the<00:02:01.290> distance<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:02.909> running<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.420> far

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the distance so it's not running as far

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.880 
the distance so it's not running as far
when<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.780> hits<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> ground<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.650> it's<00:02:04.770> not

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
when it hits the ground and it's not

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
when it hits the ground and it's not
carrying<00:02:05.250> quite<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.610> far<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.000> sort<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
carrying quite as far as sort of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169 
carrying quite as far as sort of
ballooning<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.079> me<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.650> but<00:02:07.970> all<00:02:08.970> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
ballooning on me a little bit but all in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.180 
ballooning on me a little bit but all in
all<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.540> hit<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.840> them<00:02:10.019> I<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.950> really

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
all have to hit in them I really really

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
all have to hit in them I really really
like<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.519> feel<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> new<00:02:12.090> tour<00:02:12.329> driver

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
like the feel of the new tour driver

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.140 
like the feel of the new tour driver
myself<00:02:13.170> i<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:14.340> say<00:02:14.430> i<00:02:14.459> think<00:02:14.579> i<00:02:14.790> need<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:14.970> play

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
myself i can say i think i need to play

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.850 
myself i can say i think i need to play
around<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.630> little<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> setup<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> suit

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
around a little bit with a setup to suit

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
around a little bit with a setup to suit
me<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.370> bit<00:02:17.519> more<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.410> certainly

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
me a little bit more but and certainly

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.220 
me a little bit more but and certainly
the<00:02:19.590> looks<00:02:19.799> at<00:02:20.040> address<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> being<00:02:21.230> 460cc

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the looks at address with it being 460cc

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
the looks at address with it being 460cc
and<00:02:22.650> slightly<00:02:22.829> bigger<00:02:23.100> certainly<00:02:24.060> looks<00:02:24.239> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
and slightly bigger certainly looks a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.300 
and slightly bigger certainly looks a
lot<00:02:24.450> nicer<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.930> looks<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.290> i<00:02:25.440> can<00:02:25.470> really<00:02:26.190> get

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
lot nicer it looks like i can really get

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
lot nicer it looks like i can really get
the<00:02:26.400> toe<00:02:26.579> release<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.120> sort<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.299> shape<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the toe release and sort of shape the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
the toe release and sort of shape the
ball<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.230> better<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> let's<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
ball a little bit better so let's have a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.460 
ball a little bit better so let's have a
quick<00:02:30.209> look<00:02:30.239> at<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> dispersion<00:02:31.230> with<00:02:31.350> all

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
quick look at the dispersion with all

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.400 
quick look at the dispersion with all
three<00:02:31.709> as<00:02:31.799> well<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.820> can<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.600> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
three as well so we can see the the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.490 
three as well so we can see the the
white<00:02:34.620> dots<00:02:35.220> there<00:02:35.519> on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.150> outfield<00:02:36.600> are<00:02:36.959> my

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
white dots there on the outfield are my

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.380 
white dots there on the outfield are my
current<00:02:37.829> driver<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.519> see<00:02:38.700> slightly

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
current driver so we can see slightly

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.870 
current driver so we can see slightly
yeah<00:02:39.750> slightly<00:02:40.530> erratic<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> few<00:02:41.670> right

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
yeah slightly erratic it was a few right

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.479 
yeah slightly erratic it was a few right
few<00:02:42.239> left<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> most<00:02:43.650> consistent<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
few left not the most consistent the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.550 
few left not the most consistent the
blue<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.329> can<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> new<00:02:45.989> covert<00:02:46.410> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
blue we can see is the new covert to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920 
blue we can see is the new covert to
performance<00:02:47.220> which<00:02:47.489> slightly<00:02:48.360> tighter

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
performance which slightly tighter

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
performance which slightly tighter
dispersion<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> slightly<00:02:50.519> less<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.940> distance

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
dispersion and slightly less in distance

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.720 
dispersion and slightly less in distance
though<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.859> yellow<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.579> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
though and the yellow we can see the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.330 
though and the yellow we can see the
covert<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.299> point<00:02:54.510> not<00:02:54.660> too<00:02:55.010> much<00:02:56.010> more

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
covert to point not too much more

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.670 
covert to point not too much more
accurate<00:02:56.880> slightly<00:02:57.480> longer<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:58.049> well<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
accurate slightly longer as well so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
accurate slightly longer as well so
hopefully<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> trust<00:02:59.670> start

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
hopefully I'm going to trust start

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.940 
hopefully I'm going to trust start
finding<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> hell<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.140> lot<00:03:01.260> more<00:03:01.320> fair<00:03:01.650> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
finding a hell of a lot more fair is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.430 
finding a hell of a lot more fair is
with<00:03:02.099> this<00:03:02.190> driver<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:03.569> year<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.050> looking

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
with this driver this year so looking

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.240 
with this driver this year so looking
forward<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.800> getting<00:03:04.890> mine<00:03:05.250> through

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
forward to getting mine through

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
forward to getting mine through
and<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.910> yeah<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.120> mean<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.390> good<00:03:07.840> overview

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and so yeah I mean a good overview

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140 
and so yeah I mean a good overview
fairly<00:03:08.710> tightly<00:03:08.920> dispersed<00:03:09.160> anyway<00:03:09.880> but

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
fairly tightly dispersed anyway but

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.740 
fairly tightly dispersed anyway but
certainly<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.260> three<00:03:11.590> covert<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.750> tour

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
certainly of the three covert to tour

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:30.510 
certainly of the three covert to tour
seems<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.350> be<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.590> best<00:03:14.740> one<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:14.980> myself

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.100 

so<00:03:31.520> on<00:03:31.819> then<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> fairway<00:03:32.569> wood<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:32.959> can

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
so on then to the fairway wood so we can

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.840 
so on then to the fairway wood so we can
see<00:03:33.290> ball<00:03:33.830> speed<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> little<00:03:34.310> bit<00:03:34.459> quicker

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
see ball speed a little bit quicker

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340 
see ball speed a little bit quicker
there<00:03:35.090> with<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.270> covert<00:03:35.600> tour<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.110> top

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
well which is why it's going a little

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.400 
well which is why it's going a little
bit<00:03:40.190> further<00:03:40.400> through<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.420> air<00:03:41.660> both<00:03:42.260> these

golf<00:03:42.680> clubs<00:03:42.740> look<00:03:43.130> absolutely<00:03:43.550> fantastic<00:03:44.060> sat

behind<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.020> ball<00:03:45.170> look<00:03:46.130> really<00:03:46.430> powerful<00:03:46.910> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
behind the ball look really powerful and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.430 
behind the ball look really powerful and
both<00:03:47.510> look<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.870> you're<00:03:48.020> going<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.170> hit<00:03:48.290> them

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
both look like you're going to hit them

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.250 
both look like you're going to hit them
a<00:03:48.500> very<00:03:48.680> long<00:03:48.890> way<00:03:49.069> now<00:03:49.450> I've<00:03:50.450> got<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.840> covert

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
a very long way now I've got the covert

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.590 
a very long way now I've got the covert
tour<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.220> first<00:03:52.400> version<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.850> myself<00:03:53.000> and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
tour the first version of it myself and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.750 
tour the first version of it myself and
really<00:03:54.260> felt<00:03:54.470> these<00:03:54.680> were<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.890> massive<00:03:55.310> step<00:03:55.520> on

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
really felt these were a massive step on

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.000 
really felt these were a massive step on
from<00:03:56.060> from<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:56.720> terms<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:57.170> both<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.920> way

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
from from that in terms of both the way

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.590 
from from that in terms of both the way
that<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:58.340> see<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.819> way<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.480> can

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
that they see it the way that you can

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300 
that they see it the way that you can
easily<00:04:00.050> get<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.319> ball<00:04:00.500> off<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.830> ground<00:04:01.100> with

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
easily get the ball off the ground with

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.900 
easily get the ball off the ground with
them<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:02.810> ball<00:04:02.989> flight<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.910> we

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
them and just a ball flight really we

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.340 
them and just a ball flight really we
can<00:04:05.060> see<00:04:05.180> obviously<00:04:05.480> distance<00:04:05.900> why<00:04:06.080> is<00:04:06.140> the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
can see obviously distance why is the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.199 
can see obviously distance why is the
toss<00:04:06.650> carrying<00:04:07.250> quite<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.519> quite<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:07.970> decent

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
toss carrying quite a quite a decent

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.320 
toss carrying quite a quite a decent
distance<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.489> although<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:10.850> is<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
distance and although so is the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.000 
distance and although so is the
performance<00:04:11.660> i<00:04:12.050> mean<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.410> ball<00:04:12.800> fight

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
performance i mean the the ball fight

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.530 
performance i mean the the ball fight
was<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.370> bit<00:04:13.519> stronger<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.300> tour

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
was just a bit stronger with the tour

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.720 
was just a bit stronger with the tour
though<00:04:14.780> if<00:04:14.989> we<00:04:15.620> look<00:04:15.739> here<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:16.609> the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
though if we look here and this is the

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.729 
though if we look here and this is the
performance<00:04:17.060> from<00:04:17.600> from<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.019> short<00:04:18.230> side<00:04:18.470> on

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
performance from from a short side on

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.810 
performance from from a short side on
view<00:04:19.010> we<00:04:19.100> can<00:04:19.130> see<00:04:19.280> it's<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> slightly<00:04:19.669> higher

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
view we can see it's a slightly higher

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.390 
view we can see it's a slightly higher
ball<00:04:20.390> flight<00:04:20.769> coming<00:04:21.769> down<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.010> little<00:04:22.220> bit

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
ball flight coming down a little bit

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.820 
ball flight coming down a little bit
softer<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.150> but<00:04:23.840> then<00:04:24.020> when<00:04:24.169> we<00:04:24.260> look<00:04:24.500> at<00:04:24.620> the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
softer and but then when we look at the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.500 
softer and but then when we look at the
the<00:04:24.860> tour<00:04:25.370> fairway<00:04:25.760> wood<00:04:25.940> as<00:04:26.060> well<00:04:26.240> because

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
the tour fairway wood as well because

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.120 
the tour fairway wood as well because
it's<00:04:26.660> slightly<00:04:26.900> lower<00:04:27.110> trajectory<00:04:27.410> so

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
it's slightly lower trajectory so

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.010 
it's slightly lower trajectory so
possibly<00:04:28.820> better<00:04:29.060> as<00:04:29.270> an<00:04:29.360> alternative<00:04:29.870> to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
possibly better as an alternative to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.480 
possibly better as an alternative to
your<00:04:30.139> driver<00:04:30.380> off<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.620> tee<00:04:30.770> a<00:04:31.010> little<00:04:31.340> bit

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
your driver off the tee a little bit

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.600 
your driver off the tee a little bit
more<00:04:31.750> strong<00:04:32.750> in<00:04:32.930> terms<00:04:33.139> of<00:04:33.380> its<00:04:34.040> ball<00:04:34.280> flight

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
more strong in terms of its ball flight

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.240 
more strong in terms of its ball flight
on<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.630> downrange<00:04:36.200> view<00:04:36.530> we<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.710> see<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
on the downrange view we can see the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.969 
on the downrange view we can see the
white<00:04:37.430> dots<00:04:37.700> there<00:04:37.970> being<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.330> tour<00:04:38.600> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
white dots there being the tour and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.260 
white dots there being the tour and
slightly<00:04:39.979> further<00:04:40.190> left<00:04:40.520> I've<00:04:40.729> hit<00:04:40.880> them<00:04:41.060> but

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
slightly further left I've hit them but

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390 
slightly further left I've hit them but
still<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:41.960> decent<00:04:42.290> distance<00:04:42.620> slightly<00:04:43.190> further

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
still a decent distance slightly further

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.460 
still a decent distance slightly further
than<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.880> performance<00:04:44.450> but<00:04:44.660> both<00:04:45.200> feel

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
than the performance but both feel

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.950 
than the performance but both feel
absolutely<00:04:45.710> fantastic<00:04:46.610> now<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:47.000> can't<00:04:47.810> wait<00:04:47.930> to

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
absolutely fantastic now I can't wait to

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.600 
absolutely fantastic now I can't wait to
get<00:04:48.200> these<00:04:48.410> clubs<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:48.860> my<00:04:49.010> bag<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.370> season

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
get these clubs in my bag this season

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.820 
get these clubs in my bag this season
and<00:04:50.000> really<00:04:50.810> try<00:04:51.080> them<00:04:51.229> out<00:04:51.289> properly<00:04:51.620> on<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
and really try them out properly on the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.070 
and really try them out properly on the
course
