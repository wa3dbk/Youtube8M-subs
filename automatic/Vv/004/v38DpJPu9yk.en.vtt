and the bottom here's the three
different<00:00:38.879> sizes<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.420> ended<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> then

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
different sizes I ended up with and then

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
different sizes I ended up with and then
i<00:00:45.329> spray-painted<00:00:45.950> three<00:00:46.950> terracotta<00:00:47.460> pots

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
i spray-painted three terracotta pots

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
i spray-painted three terracotta pots
with<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> metallic<00:00:48.570> spray<00:00:49.020> paint<00:00:54.590> then<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
with a metallic spray paint then take a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
with a metallic spray paint then take a
bead<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> glue<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.730> run<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> along<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.050> base

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
bead of glue and run it along the base

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.910 
bead of glue and run it along the base
of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.129> cone<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> use<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
of the cone you want to use the really

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.820 
of the cone you want to use the really
hot<00:01:05.309> glue<00:01:06.150> gun<00:01:06.420> temperature<00:01:07.260> settings<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
hot glue gun temperature settings so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
hot glue gun temperature settings so
that<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.460> stick<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.060> well<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.979> then

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that it will stick really well and then

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820 
that it will stick really well and then
just<00:01:11.280> place<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> pot<00:01:12.500> make<00:01:13.500> sure<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just place it in the pot make sure it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.109 
just place it in the pot make sure it's
straight<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:15.710> then<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.520> beads<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
straight and then put little beads of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.700 
straight and then put little beads of
glue<00:01:18.840> around<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.560> base<00:01:21.020> again<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> cone

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
glue around the base again of the cone

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.249 
glue around the base again of the cone
and<00:01:23.689> then<00:01:24.689> place<00:01:25.020> each<00:01:25.560> leaf<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:27.030> by<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
and then place each leaf one by one

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.359 
and then place each leaf one by one
along<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> glue<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.860> may<00:01:28.979> need<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.340> use

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
along the glue and you may need to use

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210 
along the glue and you may need to use
our<00:01:29.970> cloth<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.229> press<00:01:31.439> over<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
our cloth to press over it because the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.350 
our cloth to press over it because the
glue<00:01:32.400> gets<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> hot<00:01:34.790> just<00:01:35.790> continue<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
glue gets kind of hot just continue this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.539 
glue gets kind of hot just continue this
all<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.840> around<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> cone<00:01:38.130> until

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
all the way around and up the cone until

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.709 
all the way around and up the cone until
there's<00:01:38.729> no<00:01:38.970> cone<00:01:39.600> showing

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.149 

be<00:01:44.719> sure<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.020> use<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.170> smaller<00:01:45.619> leaves<00:01:45.920> at<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
be sure to use the smaller leaves at the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.950 
be sure to use the smaller leaves at the
top<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> larger<00:01:47.210> leaves<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.719> middle

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
top and the larger leaves in the middle

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.550 
top and the larger leaves in the middle
and<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> bottom<00:01:55.960> then<00:01:56.960> place<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.259> little

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and on the bottom then place a little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.419 
and on the bottom then place a little
glue<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.130> each<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.640> holly<00:01:58.819> berries<00:01:59.329> or<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.279 
leaves and then stick the holly berries
in<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> glue<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.149> press<00:02:05.450> down<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:05.840> hold

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
in the glue and then press down and hold

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.300 
in the glue and then press down and hold
it<00:02:06.469> till<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.679> dries<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.679> just<00:02:10.039> do<00:02:10.160> that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
kind of sporadically around the tree

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.920 
kind of sporadically around the tree
just<00:02:14.780> enough<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.140> make<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:15.500> nice<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.930> you

holly<00:02:19.730> berries<00:02:20.090> at<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.569> top<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.950> each<00:02:22.430> tree

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
holly berries at the top on each tree

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690 
holly berries at the top on each tree
and<00:02:26.049> there<00:02:27.049> you<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.400> three<00:02:28.400> beautiful
