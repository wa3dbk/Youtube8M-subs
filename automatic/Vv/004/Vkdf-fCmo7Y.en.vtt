00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
but I will deal with it so the recipe is
in<00:00:48.149> cups<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.960> since<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> live<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.530> Europe<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
I will just kind of improvise so first

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.799 
I will just kind of improvise so first
thing<00:00:55.440> you'll<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.949> cup<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.430> chocolate

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
thing you'll need a cup of chocolate

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.970 
thing you'll need a cup of chocolate
wikipedia<00:00:57.809> tells<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> cup<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
wikipedia tells me that a cup is the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.880 
wikipedia tells me that a cup is the
equivalent<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> 16<00:01:00.270> tablespoons<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.649> not

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
equivalent of 16 tablespoons and I'm not

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
equivalent of 16 tablespoons and I'm not
sure<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> measure<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.879> chocolate<00:01:03.390> in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
sure how to measure my chocolate in
tablespoons<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:05.040> I'll<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
tablespoons I think I'll just go for the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.700 
tablespoons I think I'll just go for the
entire<00:01:06.090> bar<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> feel<00:01:07.140> dependence<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
entire bar then you feel dependence on

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
entire bar then you feel dependence on
water<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.580> takes<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> kitchen

this<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.250> just<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.700> wild<00:01:56.380> guesstimation<00:01:57.380> so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
this is just a wild guesstimation so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.710 
this is just a wild guesstimation so
this<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.310> good<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:58.880> also<00:01:59.119> do<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.630> a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
this is good you can also do it in a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.510 
this is good you can also do it in a
microwave<00:02:00.080> but<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.530> kind<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.040> prefer<00:02:01.100> this

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
microwave but I kind of prefer this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.590 
microwave but I kind of prefer this
old-fashioned<00:02:02.210> way

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
old-fashioned way

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.880 
old-fashioned way
so<00:02:02.869> when<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.200> done<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.560> go<00:02:03.710> ahead

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
so when this is done you can go ahead

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.249 
so when this is done you can go ahead
and<00:02:04.009> add<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:04.280> butter<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.880> peanut<00:02:05.030> butter

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
and add your butter and peanut butter

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.510 
and add your butter and peanut butter
1/4<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:07.280> cup<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:09.140> butter<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.190> half<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> cup

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
1/4 of a cup of butter and a half a cup

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
1/4 of a cup of butter and a half a cup
of<00:02:10.759> peanut<00:02:11.030> butter<00:02:11.150> which<00:02:11.540> means<00:02:11.840> eight

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
of peanut butter which means eight

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.830 
of peanut butter which means eight
tablespoons<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.970> don't<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:14.510> I'm<00:02:14.569> going<00:02:14.750> to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
tablespoons I don't think I'm going to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.890 
tablespoons I don't think I'm going to
do<00:02:14.930> eight<00:02:15.230> cuz<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.819> looks<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.569> is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
do eight cuz it looks like this is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.590 
do eight cuz it looks like this is
plenty<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:18.980> comparison<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.850> chocolate<00:02:20.269> I

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
plenty in comparison to the chocolate I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.449 
plenty in comparison to the chocolate I
did<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.590> four<00:02:22.340> big<00:02:22.550> ones<00:02:22.930> melty<00:02:23.930> melty

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
now that most of the soup is covered in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
now that most of the soup is covered in
chocolate<00:03:03.170> what<00:03:03.799> I'm<00:03:03.920> gonna<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.340> add<00:03:04.579> a<00:03:04.760> lot

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
chocolate what I'm gonna do is add a lot

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:19.190

of<00:03:05.660> parted<00:03:06.110> sugar<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.730> mix<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:13.340> lid

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.730 

yeah<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.230> definitely<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:20.830> not<00:03:20.980> have<00:03:21.250> enough

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
yeah I definitely do not have enough

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.260 
yeah I definitely do not have enough
dough<00:03:23.740> so<00:03:23.920> much<00:03:24.190> sugar<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.520> have<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.880> walk<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
dough so much sugar I have to walk the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.800 
dough so much sugar I have to walk the
point<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:28.120> stops<00:03:28.480> being

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
point of this is that it stops being

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.050 
point of this is that it stops being
sticky<00:03:29.320> that's<00:03:29.950> probably<00:03:30.490> as<00:03:30.640> good<00:03:30.850> as<00:03:30.970> it's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
sticky that's probably as good as it's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.790 
sticky that's probably as good as it's
ever<00:03:31.210> gonna<00:03:31.480> get<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.470> what<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.650> looks

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
ever gonna get so this is what it looks

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.980 
ever gonna get so this is what it looks
like<00:03:32.920> right<00:03:33.130> now<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.670> an<00:03:33.790> ideal<00:03:34.180> situation<00:03:34.450> you

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
like right now in an ideal situation you

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.650 
like right now in an ideal situation you
would<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.980> lot<00:03:36.610> more<00:03:36.640> powdered<00:03:37.090> sugar<00:03:37.420> and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
would have a lot more powdered sugar and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.510 
would have a lot more powdered sugar and
all<00:03:38.050> of<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.290> would<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.530> coated<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.190> think

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
all of it would be coated but I think

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.730 
all of it would be coated but I think
it's<00:03:39.670> mostly<00:03:40.030> dried<00:03:40.720> up<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.320> all<00:03:41.440> there's<00:03:41.680> left

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
it's mostly dried up so all there's left

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.700 
it's mostly dried up so all there's left
to<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.070> now<00:03:42.100> is<00:03:42.730> eat<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:44.080> don't<00:03:44.290> feed<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.590> to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
to do now is eat it but don't feed it to

to do now is eat it but don't feed it to
