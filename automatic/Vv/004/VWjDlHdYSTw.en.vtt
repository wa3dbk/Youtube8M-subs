00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
how does it how do the red lights work

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.630 
how does it how do the red lights work
here's<00:00:54.500> what<00:00:54.650> else<00:00:54.830> this<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.220> most

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
here's what else this is the most

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.610 
here's what else this is the most
advanced<00:00:56.150> thing<00:00:56.479> we<00:00:56.570> could<00:00:56.720> get<00:00:56.870> here<00:00:57.080> we<00:00:57.470> have

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
advanced thing we could get here we have

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.350 
advanced thing we could get here we have
these<00:00:57.710> little<00:00:57.830> cars<00:00:58.129> here<00:00:58.370> let's<00:00:58.790> say<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.000> car

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
these little cars here let's say a car

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.820 
these little cars here let's say a car
is<00:00:59.479> to<00:00:59.540> enter<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.960> intersection<00:01:00.199> here

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
is to enter the intersection here

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.670 
is to enter the intersection here
underneath<00:01:01.729> this<00:01:02.059> pad<00:01:02.360> here<00:01:02.839> picture<00:01:03.470> this

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
underneath this pad here picture this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.830 
underneath this pad here picture this
that<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.309> actually<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> metal<00:01:05.030> detector<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.720> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
that is actually a metal detector so the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.660 
that is actually a metal detector so the
second<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.170> car<00:01:06.470> crosses<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.220> intersection

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
second this car crosses the intersection

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.160 
second this car crosses the intersection
is<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.270> be<00:01:08.360> picked<00:01:08.600> up<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.990> then

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
is going to be picked up and then

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.109 
is going to be picked up and then
actually<00:01:10.070> flash<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.520> going<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.729> go<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:10.970> like

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
actually flash is going to go on like

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.539 
actually flash is going to go on like
Big<00:01:11.299> Brother's<00:01:11.690> off<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:13.100> they're<00:01:13.310> gonna<00:01:13.400> take

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
Big Brother's off so they're gonna take

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.830 
Big Brother's off so they're gonna take
a<00:01:13.580> flash<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.850> like<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.540> they're<00:01:14.750> gonna

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
a flash just like that they're gonna

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.149 
a flash just like that they're gonna
take<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.020> flash<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.380> actually<00:01:15.650> have<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> driver

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
take a flash to actually have the driver

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.310 
take a flash to actually have the driver
in<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> front<00:01:16.820> plate<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:17.990> what<00:01:18.109> you're<00:01:18.200> going

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
in the front plate so what you're going

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.230 
in the front plate so what you're going
to<00:01:18.380> want<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.619> do<00:01:18.799> is<00:01:19.070> somehow<00:01:19.520> protect<00:01:20.090> that

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
to want to do is somehow protect that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.580 
to want to do is somehow protect that
plate<00:01:20.479> actually<00:01:20.719> cover<00:01:21.109> it<00:01:21.200> up<00:01:21.350> make<00:01:21.560> sure

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
plate actually cover it up make sure

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.529 
plate actually cover it up make sure
that<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.159> know<00:01:22.310> they<00:01:22.729> can<00:01:22.909> actually<00:01:22.939> get<00:01:23.390> that

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
that you know they can actually get that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.870 
that you know they can actually get that

if you'll notice what happens is when we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.719 
if you'll notice what happens is when we
rotate<00:01:38.539> this<00:01:38.780> you're<00:01:39.350> actually<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:40.520> can't

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
rotate this you're actually you can't

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.099 
rotate this you're actually you can't
see<00:01:40.850> -<00:01:40.969> oh<00:01:40.999> there<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.390> go<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:41.719> actually<00:01:41.990> going

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
see - oh there we go it's actually going

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.160 
see - oh there we go it's actually going
to<00:01:42.200> blur<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.340> actual<00:01:43.789> plate<00:01:44.030> number<00:01:44.359> there<00:01:44.570> so

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
to blur the actual plate number there so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.389 
to blur the actual plate number there so
that<00:01:45.409> that's<00:01:45.619> pretty<00:01:45.770> cool<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.219> when<00:01:46.310> you

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
that that's pretty cool so when you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.380 
that that's pretty cool so when you
drive<00:01:46.579> through<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.789> intersection<00:01:47.359> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
drive through the intersection that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.139 
drive through the intersection that
flash<00:01:47.780> goes<00:01:48.079> off<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:49.070> captures<00:01:50.060> that

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
flash goes off and that captures that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.700 
flash goes off and that captures that
image<00:01:50.630> they're<00:01:51.049> not<00:01:51.229> gonna<00:01:51.320> be<00:01:51.409> able<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.590> read

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
image they're not gonna be able to read

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.870
