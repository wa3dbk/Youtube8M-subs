00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.380
 good afternoon dear friends are you looking 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.200
 video on appleinsider.ru and 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.240
 Today we are in the office 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.060
 game insight where we are shown 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 toy tank domination which is creepy like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.200
 It seems that everyone knows the world of tanks 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.810
 SEC but still in the game there are some 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.750
 differences and it can be said that the game is not 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.180
 is full of tracing paper besides immediately 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.180
 It is worth starting with the fact that the game will appear in 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 appstore and google play at the end of the summer 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 early autumn the projector can be said 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
 just about google play as always not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.690
 absolutely everything is known but in any case 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.489
 all we see here is a game 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 built on the engine of all known 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.309
 the unity3d engine on which it is built 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 a huge number of famous and cool 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.160
 toys and therefore it can be argued that in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 principle 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
 despite the big locations in the game 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.780
 quite a decent picture 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 natural multiplayer game so 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.650
 Now we will try to get to our 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.049
 vrazhina 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.000
 and try to kick him for something 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.650
 if we of course succeed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.799
 control in the game is carried out with 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.320
 using two sticks on the screens left 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.060
 the tank hull controls us right 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.060
 always manage the towers so here it is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.000
 you can turn left right this is ours so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 I believe ally because he is green and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 now we are heading towards the enemy also 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.049
 you can twist the camera like this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 normal swipe across the screen if suddenly 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 for some reason you are not comfortable using 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.710
 stick and yes we already see the enemies like that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.079
 the way we approach and try 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.310
 Now hit it if it comes out 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:00.810
 this bump and while we wait when 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 will our enemy pub pa pa worth it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 say that the game will be free it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 very wonderful but many right away 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.210
 surely will worry what 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.760
 the number of in-game purchases in it 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.190
 will of course be without in-game 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.530
 shopping does not cost but as us 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.080
 This developers are players who do not want 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.240
 invest money will play absolutely 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 on a par with those who invest 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.980
 the only difference will be in time 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.690
 because of course those who are not 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.080
 one hundred second will be pumped over 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.860
 faster than those who play on 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.860
 free of charge and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.620
 like us they are now under the guise of the same to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:46.220
 management needs to get used 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.220
 this fact is about try to escape this 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.590
 honestly i'm not a big fan personally 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.410
 tanks and I absolutely did not even play 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.120
 You can say in those same world of tanks 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.000
 but at least what I see here 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.340
 I really like the ipad because 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.490
 Now on the map, in principle, not much 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.400
 enemies and in the team we have the same people 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.840
 not so much but when it comes to 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.450
 battles 10 to 10 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.460
 I think this will be very, very 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 interesting and exciting and beyond that 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.450
 you can play almost anywhere 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.570
 as supported not only by the office and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.460
 Deni but in principle if you have a good 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.290
 good mobile operator will not be now 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.240
 of course go into details who 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.910
 have a good one of them there but if 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.950
 you have stable 3g connections then you 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.590
 well be able to play anywhere on 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.110
 the street sitting on a bench under the scorching summer 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.810
 the sun 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.910
 as for the tanks themselves most of 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.700
 them the most that neither is a real tanks 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.460
 and besides that 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.610
 also worth remembering that in the game 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.940
 will be 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.710
 artillery that is you can choose 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.260
 let's say the artillery for the shkery 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.630
 somewhere in the bush and shoot 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.460
 enemies of these very bushes naturally 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.790
 artillery is quite vulnerable in terms of 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.780
 that it is very slow and 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.670
 it is necessary that someone from your team 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:20.359
 you still somehow 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:23.670
 covered up what not killed go further 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.250
 I was carried out nevertheless small 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.960
 master of playing tanks but i think that 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.910
 first impression of the game tank 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.300
 domination game insight we are with you already 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.030
 were able to make up waiting for the release of the game in 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.260
 appstore and google play and meet at 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.260
 bye bye
