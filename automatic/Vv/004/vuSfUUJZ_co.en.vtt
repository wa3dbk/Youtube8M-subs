00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.610
 now on motocross we talk about 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.980
 expressions a very important thing 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.080
 first of all it is to adjust the attitude 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 of the bike 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.990
 we feel that we intend to have a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.130
 negative which is the fender game 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.290
 rear 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 we say that is on the two drag means 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.420
 Japanese doctors increases 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 up on the ktm shots of them then ptk 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 then we have negative in this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 a caregiver in the fork of 2 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.220
 inches and even here and this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's say they must be respected for 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.420
 have a good set up of the bike like 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.670
 adjustment by the fitter to enter the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.180
 fundamental innovations that are one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.609
 low speed city ​​tree and return the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 just a city and the nearby central 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.680
 gold colored that practically series when 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.170
 we travel a stretch becomes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.650
 travel lowers the company then 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 this starting from a curve anna punta 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.140
 curve line and this one flew 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 we can hear more or less the holes e 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.579
 Briano gives us more strength and less with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.020
 strength from more than hama 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.310
 quite closed in that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.640
 tuned the faster it closes 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.030
 minus the bike instead of giving the city ​​that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 the external nut 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.200
 this pass in a very fast stretch 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.560
 like a three- way recoil of a sugar jump 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.930
 this decision too 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.720
 closing it away we feel the bike more 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.330
 stiff and instead if you have a little states that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.030
 we want to know immediately even here 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.380
 always going risks then there is that more 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.649
 important that the return below 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.259
 of the shock absorber and this we must 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.570
 vary according to the track if the track is 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.729
 very bored from a hard track we tend 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 to get a very fast return in 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.700
 how much having holes inside each other e 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.110
 We must allow the wheel to return to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.120
 position was then second has instead if 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.430
 if the sand track then with holes 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.340
 more than the wave we will keep a return more 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 braked to allow to avoid 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.739
 some waving the bike too 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.269
 here we say we are on renzi 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.989
 of all closed minus thirteen fourteen 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.319
 shots 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.080
 this also for the life of the bass 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.260
 city ​​is however I don't think that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.370
 basically about these things 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.150
 passing the fork instead of two 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.970
 adjustments that a compression 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.280
 the reality and in the return on the under the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 leg talking about cartridge fork 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.799
 closed that now like all motorcycles from 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.810
 cross year the compression island it 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.939
 we will use when we want to have 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.180
 a softer harder fork in 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.129
 sinking and especially when if 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.310
 we have strength gave birth to 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.970
 we will close it a bit if it is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.590
 showing and wanting we want one 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.349
 mobile jump we will wait to open it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.810
 here too we have renzi 13 12 states a 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.030
 game all closed instead on the return 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.280
 also there always 12 3 of shoes to everything 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.049
 closed and allows us to adjust to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.370
 city ​​back to the fork this 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.310
 allows to have directionality on the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.560
 fast 36 queens of wands we will take 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.349
 close it a little to play it to play 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.130
 speed but very important thing to 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.350
 say and I feel from it takes off 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.990
 for the air on a maybe on the fork 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.780
 between one round and the other because this 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.610
 increasing the area then increases the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.870
 strength was becomes faster return 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.990
 you increase the samba and nothing this is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.460
 important to remember but what to say about 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.870
 a production bike 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.260
 if we go to lose maybe a lot 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.780
 hard because the parent company holds 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.270
 literature as hard as how 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.910
 security no less because it does not satirize the 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.010
 tend to hurt the average driver 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.090
 we tend to make them softer to make them 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.520
 softer and perhaps ktm than there is 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.840
 he has it more than all that good or 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.910
 bad of sandy series you succeed in 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 use another important thing 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.620
 on the fork we say that 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.630
 fundamental change and forest ness 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.130
 how much they are lacking in the incorrect on 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.960
 fork does not exist gait calibration 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.060
 because it doesn't work so we don't 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.380
 we have sensitivity 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.550
 no sensitivity especially 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.610
 on the hard to remember is that it is a warning 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.640
 fork have a standard spring of 70 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.160
 kg made on average 70 kg so it goes 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.230
 well a pilot up to 80 then also there 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 you need to see if a smartphone or 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.470
 because however one of the fort 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.170
 a spring changed her if one goes slow 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.190
 even if on several we say it's okay 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.730
 serious ones also because not the moon one 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.590
 example use exasperated and therefore us 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.070
 tend to spring leave in 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.070
 ash
