demonstration<00:00:05.760> of<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> do<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:06.420> need<00:00:06.630> to

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
demonstration of how you do not need to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.110 
demonstration of how you do not need to
be<00:00:06.900> an<00:00:06.990> artist<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.620> draw<00:00:07.830> biological<00:00:08.639> diagrams

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
be an artist to draw biological diagrams

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360 
be an artist to draw biological diagrams
but<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.660> should<00:00:09.960> indeed<00:00:10.290> practice<00:00:10.860> these<00:00:11.100> as

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
but you should indeed practice these as

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.340 
but you should indeed practice these as
it<00:00:11.760> is<00:00:11.820> expected<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.720> could<00:00:13.050> draw<00:00:13.260> it

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
it is expected that you could draw it

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.490 
it is expected that you could draw it
yourself<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.570> this<00:00:15.570> example<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.349> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
yourself in this example it's a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
yourself in this example it's a
eukaryotic<00:00:17.040> cell<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.790> need<00:00:17.939> to<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.150> able<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
eukaryotic cell we need to be able to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.980 
eukaryotic cell we need to be able to
label<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.110> parts<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.500> we've<00:00:19.710> drawn<00:00:20.990> so

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
label all the parts that we've drawn so

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.210 
label all the parts that we've drawn so
first<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> label<00:00:22.830> our

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
first I'm going to label our

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.939 
first I'm going to label our
mitochondria<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:24.360> singular<00:00:24.949> mitochondrion

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
mitochondria as singular mitochondrion

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.290 
mitochondria as singular mitochondrion
so<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.520> that's<00:00:26.640> why<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.940> should<00:00:27.090> have

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so really that's why I should have

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
so really that's why I should have
written<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.020> them<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> have

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
written for one of them but here I have

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
written for one of them but here I have
single<00:00:29.940> lines<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> middle<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> represents

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
single lines in the middle it represents

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
single lines in the middle it represents
the<00:00:31.500> internal<00:00:32.070> compartments<00:00:32.790> formed<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the internal compartments formed by the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.560 
the internal compartments formed by the
inner<00:00:33.600> membrane<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> mitochondrion<00:00:35.570> next

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
inner membrane of the mitochondrion next

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.940 
inner membrane of the mitochondrion next
you<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.960> ribosomes<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.800> are

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you have my ribosomes which are

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
you have my ribosomes which are
represented<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.550> orange<00:00:39.059> dots<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
represented by orange dots here in the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
represented by orange dots here in the
cytoplasm<00:00:40.970> then<00:00:41.970> you<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.630> smooth

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
cytoplasm then you have the smooth

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.860 
cytoplasm then you have the smooth
endoplasmic<00:00:43.440> reticulum<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.550> ser<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
endoplasmic reticulum or ser and this is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
endoplasmic reticulum or ser and this is
an<00:00:45.989> interconnected<00:00:46.350> network<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> tubules<00:00:47.969> but

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
an interconnected network of tubules but

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
an interconnected network of tubules but
it<00:00:48.300> doesn't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.780> any<00:00:48.960> Associated<00:00:49.739> ribosomes

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it doesn't have any Associated ribosomes

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.810 
it doesn't have any Associated ribosomes
in<00:00:50.840> contrast<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.079> rough<00:00:52.350> endoplasmic

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
in contrast the rough endoplasmic

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
in contrast the rough endoplasmic
reticulum<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:54.000> ER<00:00:54.690> does<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.680> associated

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
reticulum our ER does have associated

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
reticulum our ER does have associated
ribosomes<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.059> I've<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.450> orange<00:00:57.840> dots

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
ribosomes so I've put my orange dots

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.610 
ribosomes so I've put my orange dots
around<00:00:58.620> those<00:00:58.829> tubules<00:00:59.719> my<00:01:00.719> nucleus<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> going

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
around those tubules my nucleus is going

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
around those tubules my nucleus is going
to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.770> represented<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> large<00:01:02.910> dark<00:01:03.329> circle

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to be represented by a large dark circle

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
to be represented by a large dark circle
as<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.289> is<00:01:04.440> often<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> might<00:01:05.399> see

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
as this is often the way you might see

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.249 
as this is often the way you might see
it<00:01:05.759> under<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> microscope<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> cell<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
it under the microscope if the cell is

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.460 
it under the microscope if the cell is
not<00:01:07.619> dividing<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.569> cytoplasm<00:01:09.959> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
not dividing and then the cytoplasm is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.169 
not dividing and then the cytoplasm is
going<00:01:10.679> to<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> fluid<00:01:11.369> filling<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.880> space

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
going to be the fluid filling the space

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to be the fluid filling the space
in<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.569> all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.959> organelles<00:01:13.380> are

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
in which all the organelles are

represent the vesicles that may break

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.740 
represent the vesicles that may break
away<00:01:21.209> from<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.720> Golgi<00:01:22.080> apparatus<00:01:23.750> lysosomes

I'm<00:01:25.410> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.649> represent<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:26.250> colored

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I'm going to represent as colored

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
I'm going to represent as colored
