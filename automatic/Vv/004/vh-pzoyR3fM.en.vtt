Reapers that's the only who's I could
think<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.299> why<00:01:21.720> he<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> gas

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
think of that why he would get the gas

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.880 
think of that why he would get the gas
and<00:01:23.299> by<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> way<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> game<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
there is a hatchery fast hatch coming up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.999 
there is a hatchery fast hatch coming up
here<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:47.460> dream<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.390> 16<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> guess<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here by dream and on 16 I guess or it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.080 
here by dream and on 16 I guess or it
could<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.159> been<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.490> guess<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> could<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
could have been I guess it could be in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
could have been I guess it could be in
15<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.320> anyway<00:01:52.590> he<00:01:52.710> should<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> pull<00:01:53.220> down

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
15 so anyway he should have a pull down

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
15 so anyway he should have a pull down
pretty<00:01:53.579> fast<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> pretty<00:01:55.200> soon<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
pretty fast here as a pretty soon here I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.690 
pretty fast here as a pretty soon here I
mean<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.579> go

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
mean there we go up or it's gonna go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.020 
mean there we go up or it's gonna go
down<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:58.009> this<00:01:59.009> rocks<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.579> almost

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
down right now as this rocks is almost

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.690 
down right now as this rocks is almost
done<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.500> strong<00:02:01.770> stuff<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.399> trying

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
done and the strong stuff in here trying

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
done and the strong stuff in here trying
to<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.409> much<00:02:04.619> scouting<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.100> possible<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to do as much scouting as possible and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.119 
to do as much scouting as possible and
that<00:02:06.630> rocks<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> finish<00:02:07.770> em

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that rocks is going to finish em

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
that rocks is going to finish em
adducing<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> marine<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.030> orbital<00:02:09.869> come<00:02:09.959> here

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
adducing a marine and orbital come here

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.119 
adducing a marine and orbital come here
should<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.349> coming<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.649> at<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> same<00:02:10.950> time

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
should be coming in at the same time

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.530 
should be coming in at the same time
here<00:02:11.400> actually

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
here actually

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420 
here actually
he's<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.900> 16<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.500> he<00:02:13.620> downworlder<00:02:14.159> command

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
he's on 16 so he downworlder command

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.280 
he's on 16 so he downworlder command
it's<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.909> little<00:02:15.180> bit<00:02:15.269> delayed<00:02:15.480> now<00:02:16.170> it's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it's just a little bit delayed now it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.539 
it's just a little bit delayed now it's
like<00:02:16.349> he<00:02:16.500> said<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> got<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:16.920> right<00:02:17.099> there<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
like he said I got it right there and

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.339 
like he said I got it right there and
actually<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.299> don't<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.599> any<00:02:18.780> Marines<00:02:19.109> coming

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
actually we don't see any Marines coming

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.069 
actually we don't see any Marines coming
down<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:20.069> guess<00:02:20.760> he<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.750> want

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
down right now I guess he does not want

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.990 
down right now I guess he does not want
to<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.530> any<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.400> tech<00:02:23.640> from<00:02:23.879> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
to go for any kind of tech from the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640 
to go for any kind of tech from the
barracks<00:02:24.359> as<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.629> years<00:02:24.810> getting<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.140> factory

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
barracks as the years getting a factory

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.520 
barracks as the years getting a factory
up<00:02:25.829> instead<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> most<00:02:27.840> likely<00:02:27.959> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> see

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
up instead so most likely going to see

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.949 
up instead so most likely going to see
some<00:02:28.680> fast<00:02:29.099> Hellion<00:02:29.970> rushes<00:02:30.329> or<00:02:30.569> something

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
some fast Hellion rushes or something

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.170 
some fast Hellion rushes or something
like<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.109> there<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> reactor<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:33.030> down

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
like that there is a reactor going down

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.780 
like that there is a reactor going down
so<00:02:33.359> maybe<00:02:35.540> maybe<00:02:36.540> maybe<00:02:37.340> tanks<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so maybe maybe maybe tanks or in the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
so maybe maybe maybe tanks or in the
Marines<00:02:39.090> or<00:02:39.359> no<00:02:39.569> number<00:02:39.870> i<00:02:39.959> sorry<00:02:40.230> he's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
Marines or no number i sorry he's

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.679 
Marines or no number i sorry he's
playing<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.010> reactor<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.540> he<00:02:42.599> got

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
playing this reactor here so that he got

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.420 
playing this reactor here so that he got
swatted<00:02:43.049> what<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.379> factory<00:02:43.799> after<00:02:43.920> her<00:02:44.189> son

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
swatted what the factory after her son

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.170 
swatted what the factory after her son
what<00:02:44.700> am<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.849> thinking<00:02:44.879> here<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.220> nice

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
what am I thinking here and so I nice

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
what am I thinking here and so I nice
response<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.109> road<00:02:49.319> horn<00:02:49.560> by<00:02:49.859> dream

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
response here is the road horn by dream

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.250 
response here is the road horn by dream
so<00:02:51.209> I'm<00:02:51.269> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.510> try<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.720> defend<00:02:51.959> against

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
so I'm going to try and defend against

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.250 
so I'm going to try and defend against
those<00:02:52.379> fast<00:02:52.739> fast<00:02:53.040> hellions<00:02:53.489> as<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:54.780> do<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.230> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
those fast fast hellions as we do have a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.009 
those fast fast hellions as we do have a
gas<00:02:55.859> stolen<00:02:56.519> by<00:02:56.760> dreams<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:57.780> think

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
gas stolen by dreams but I don't think

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.360 
gas stolen by dreams but I don't think
that's<00:02:58.169> going<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.379> be<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> effective

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
that's going to be that effective

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.780 
that's going to be that effective
because<00:03:00.409> that<00:03:01.409> we<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.069> have<00:03:02.189> Helens<00:03:02.549> coming

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
because that we do we have Helens coming

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.699 
because that we do we have Helens coming
out<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.599> any<00:03:03.810> tanks<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
out and not going to be any tanks so the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.199 
out and not going to be any tanks so the
one<00:03:04.889> gas<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.250> not<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> big<00:03:05.609> deal<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:05.879> this<00:03:06.000> time

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
one gas is not a big deal at this time

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.899 
one gas is not a big deal at this time
for<00:03:06.989> cool<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.829> reactor<00:03:08.250> Finch<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.579> just<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
for cool as the reactor Finch is just in

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.119 
for cool as the reactor Finch is just in
time<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> nice<00:03:09.450> timing<00:03:09.720> there<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.109> these<00:03:10.950> guys

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
time a nice timing there as these guys

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.039 
time a nice timing there as these guys
are<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.519> swap<00:03:11.819> in<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.239> barracks<00:03:12.659> is

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
are going to swap in the barracks is

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.170 
are going to swap in the barracks is
probably<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> pump<00:03:13.889> out<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:15.000> as

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
probably going to pump out something as

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.670 
probably going to pump out something as
we<00:03:15.299> do<00:03:15.419> have<00:03:15.599> two<00:03:15.840> hellions<00:03:16.079> on<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.409> way<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
we do have two hellions on the way and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.430 
we do have two hellions on the way and
embarrass<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> make<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> marine<00:03:17.729> as<00:03:17.970> well

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
embarrass going to make a marine as well

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.569 
embarrass going to make a marine as well
over<00:03:19.440> lower<00:03:19.620> should<00:03:19.889> be<00:03:19.979> trying<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> run<00:03:20.549> away

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
likely so for healthier sounding they

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.199 
likely so for healthier sounding they

down<00:06:28.469> at<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.740> same<00:06:28.889> time<00:06:29.099> here<00:06:29.370> for<00:06:29.759> cool<00:06:30.060> as<00:06:30.599> I

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
down at the same time here for cool as I

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.360 
down at the same time here for cool as I
do<00:06:30.870> think<00:06:31.169> he<00:06:31.259> wants<00:06:31.469> to<00:06:31.530> swap<00:06:31.830> probably<00:06:32.219> to<00:06:32.340> a

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
do think he wants to swap probably to a

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.559 
do think he wants to swap probably to a
marauder<00:06:32.849> army<00:06:33.779> I<00:06:33.960> would<00:06:34.740> think<00:06:34.770> because<00:06:35.190> it

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
marauder army I would think because it

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.589 
marauder army I would think because it
have<00:06:35.689> a<00:06:35.719> roach<00:06:36.349> on<00:06:36.379> the<00:06:36.649> ground<00:06:37.569> so<00:06:38.569> that

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
have a roach on the ground so that

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.869

acquitted<00:07:01.879> really<00:07:02.209> faster<00:07:02.599> as<00:07:02.809> this<00:07:02.990> one<00:07:03.199> is

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
acquitted really faster as this one is

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.799

going<00:07:03.830> down<00:07:03.949> slowly<00:07:04.249> and<00:07:04.520> really<00:07:05.179> not<00:07:05.419> using

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809 
going down slowly and really not using

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.409 
going down slowly and really not using
this<00:07:05.990> sprung<00:07:06.649> for<00:07:06.860> that<00:07:07.009> you<00:07:07.189> that<00:07:07.270> you<00:07:08.270> know

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
this sprung for that you that you know

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.989 
this sprung for that you that you know
not<00:07:08.959> well<00:07:09.169> because<00:07:09.649> they<00:07:10.490> were<00:07:10.610> out<00:07:10.759> of<00:07:10.789> range

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999 
not well because they were out of range

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:13.629 
not well because they were out of range
so<00:07:11.990> these<00:07:12.110> guys<00:07:12.319> are<00:07:12.379> gonna<00:07:12.709> kill<00:07:13.069> that<00:07:13.099> nexus

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
so these guys are gonna kill that nexus

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.159 
so these guys are gonna kill that nexus
probably<00:07:13.999> the<00:07:14.119> queen<00:07:14.360> is<00:07:14.389> slowly<00:07:14.749> coming<00:07:14.959> out

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
probably the queen is slowly coming out

probably the queen is slowly coming out
right<00:07:15.319> now<00:07:15.520> but<00:07:16.520> the<00:07:16.639> roads<00:07:16.849> icy<00:07:17.270> I<00:07:17.899> guess<00:07:18.709> it

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
right now but the roads icy I guess it

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.230 
right now but the roads icy I guess it
will<00:07:19.009> try<00:07:19.159> to<00:07:19.219> kill<00:07:19.399> one<00:07:19.550> PhD<00:07:19.909> but<00:07:19.999> not<00:07:20.149> is

will try to kill one PhD but not is
definitely<00:07:20.599> not<00:07:20.719> worth<00:07:20.959> the<00:07:21.050> time<00:07:21.199> at<00:07:21.800> 3pm

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
definitely not worth the time at 3pm

so<00:07:44.360> a<00:07:44.389> nice<00:07:44.809> kinder<00:07:45.110> by<00:07:45.259> cool<00:07:45.499> i<00:07:45.649> actually

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
so a nice kinder by cool i actually

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.649 
so a nice kinder by cool i actually
thought<00:07:46.699> he<00:07:46.759> was<00:07:46.909> in<00:07:46.999> trouble<00:07:47.149> because<00:07:47.389> of<00:07:47.509> the

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:47.659 
thought he was in trouble because of the

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:49.449 
thought he was in trouble because of the
rotors<00:07:48.019> but<00:07:48.259> the<00:07:48.349> Banshees<00:07:48.709> coming<00:07:49.039> out<00:07:49.159> just

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:49.459 
rotors but the Banshees coming out just

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:53.980 
rotors but the Banshees coming out just
in<00:07:49.580> time<00:07:49.639> to<00:07:50.539> defend<00:07:50.839> against<00:07:51.169> that<00:07:51.490> so<00:07:52.869> to<00:07:53.869> the

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:53.990 
in time to defend against that so to the

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.079 
in time to defend against that so to the
circular<00:07:54.379> actually<00:07:54.709> i<00:07:55.009> mean<00:07:55.279> i<00:07:55.459> think<00:07:55.819> he's

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:56.089 
circular actually i mean i think he's

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:57.339 
circular actually i mean i think he's
probably<00:07:56.329> should<00:07:56.629> defend<00:07:56.869> it<00:07:57.019> with<00:07:57.139> those

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349 
probably should defend it with those

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.019 
probably should defend it with those
those<00:07:57.889> roaches<00:07:58.129> and<00:07:58.519> probably<00:07:58.759> shouldn't
