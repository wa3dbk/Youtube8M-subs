 it is well-moisturizes the skin does not leave 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.679
 mask effect is quickly absorbed and very 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:44.260

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:46.059
 tonal basis to our 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.670

00:00:48.879 --> 00:01:01.089
 tone and added white to it as a result 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:04.030

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:11.079

 for use in feathering 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.130

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.469
 is transferred 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:46.580
 so we take a black pencil outline magician 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:48.710
