berry blush lip stains come from all

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.880 
berry blush lip stains come from all
kinds<00:00:26.750> of<00:00:26.900> different<00:00:27.080> brands<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:27.769> is

kinds of different brands and this is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.349 
kinds of different brands and this is
just<00:00:28.070> one<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.279> I'm<00:00:28.400> showing<00:00:28.640> in<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:28.999> video

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
just one that I'm showing in this video

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.999 
just one that I'm showing in this video
and<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:29.779> guess<00:00:30.080> that<00:00:30.259> they<00:00:30.349> work<00:00:30.589> in<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.829> pretty

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
and I guess that they work in a pretty

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.520 
and I guess that they work in a pretty
similar<00:00:31.279> way<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.029> for<00:00:32.780> those<00:00:32.900> of<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.200> who<00:00:33.350> know

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
similar way so for those of you who know

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.340 
similar way so for those of you who know
trying<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.890> lip<00:00:34.070> stain<00:00:34.310> before<00:00:35.350> staining

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
trying to lip stain before staining

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.930 
trying to lip stain before staining
means<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.070> only<00:00:37.250> get<00:00:37.400> like<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> little

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
means that you only get like a little

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.810 
means that you only get like a little
bit<00:00:38.240> of<00:00:38.270> color<00:00:38.570> like<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.810> flush<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.650> color<00:00:39.980> and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
bit of color like a flush of color and

bit of color like a flush of color and
not<00:00:40.910> like<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.210> harsh<00:00:41.540> line<00:00:41.990> as<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.650> would<00:00:42.830> from

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
not like a harsh line as you would from

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.970 
not like a harsh line as you would from
a<00:00:43.190> lipstick<00:00:43.640> or<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.850> lip<00:00:43.880> pen<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.590> lip<00:00:45.830> stain

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.690 
a lipstick or a lip pen so a lip stain
is<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.970> perfect<00:00:47.900> way<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.740> get<00:00:49.310> just<00:00:49.580> a<00:00:49.670> little

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
is a perfect way to get just a little

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.850 
is a perfect way to get just a little
bit<00:00:50.150> more<00:00:50.420> color<00:00:50.690> but<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.260> more<00:00:51.410> subtle<00:00:51.710> way

bit more color but in a more subtle way

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.430 
bit more color but in a more subtle way
and<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.880> way<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.210> I'm<00:00:53.420> going<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.810> use<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:54.200> as

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
and the way that I'm going to use it as

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.100 
and the way that I'm going to use it as
by<00:00:54.800> enhancing<00:00:55.460> my<00:00:55.970> upper<00:00:56.330> lip<00:00:56.510> as<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:56.870> guys

that much color on my lips I like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160 
that much color on my lips I like
focusing<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.210> eyes<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:08.780> not<00:01:08.870> really

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
focusing on the eyes so it's not really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.660 
focusing on the eyes so it's not really
that<00:01:09.290> big<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.470> an<00:01:09.650> issue<00:01:09.800> for<00:01:09.920> me<00:01:10.220> but<00:01:10.370> if<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.610> do

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
that big of an issue for me but if I do

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.970 
that big of an issue for me but if I do
want<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.120> wear<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.570> really<00:01:12.230> luscious<00:01:12.740> red

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
want to wear like really luscious red

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.550 
want to wear like really luscious red
lips<00:01:13.280> or<00:01:13.520> anything<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.120> it<00:01:15.050> tends<00:01:15.380> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
lips or anything like that it tends to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010 
lips or anything like that it tends to
look<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.100> little<00:01:16.370> well<00:01:17.360> it<00:01:17.600> doesn't<00:01:17.750> look

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
look a little well it doesn't look

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.870 
look a little well it doesn't look
perfect<00:01:18.260> because<00:01:18.680> my<00:01:18.740> lips<00:01:19.040> are<00:01:19.220> kind<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.670> thin

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
perfect because my lips are kind of thin

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.030 
perfect because my lips are kind of thin
so<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:20.330> does<00:01:20.720> look<00:01:20.870> better<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.230> a<00:01:21.380> full<00:01:21.620> set<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
so it does look better on a full set of

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.470 
so it does look better on a full set of
lips<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:22.490> I'm<00:01:22.580> gonna<00:01:22.700> show<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:22.970> how<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.210> cheat

today<00:01:23.860> using<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.890> lip<00:01:25.610> stain<00:01:25.880> pen<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:28.000> looks

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
today using the lip stain pen it looks

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060 
today using the lip stain pen it looks
like<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.450> color<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.900> really<00:01:30.320> dark

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
like this color is really dark

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.219 
like this color is really dark
it's<00:01:32.030> called<00:01:32.240> berry<00:01:32.420> blush<00:01:32.659> but<00:01:32.870> it<00:01:33.020> really

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
it's called berry blush but it really

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.420 
it's called berry blush but it really
isn't<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.550> pretty<00:01:35.270> much<00:01:35.479> as<00:01:35.750> close<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.710> my

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
isn't this is pretty much as close to my

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.760 
isn't this is pretty much as close to my
natural<00:01:37.490> lip<00:01:38.240> color<00:01:38.300> as<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.960> could<00:01:39.170> come<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.650> know

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
natural lip color as I could come I know

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800 
natural lip color as I could come I know
it<00:01:39.950> sounds<00:01:40.550> weird<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:41.510> looks

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it sounds weird because it really looks

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.780 
it sounds weird because it really looks
like<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.050> really<00:01:42.560> dark<00:01:42.800> color<00:01:43.159> but<00:01:43.580> that's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
like a really dark color but that's

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.210

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:50.360 
then I'm just going to fill out the
entire<00:03:13.630> upper<00:03:14.020> lip

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.370 

making<00:03:51.150> sure<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.360> they're<00:03:51.720> even

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.940 

and<00:03:58.890> then<00:03:59.100> doing<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.580> lower<00:03:59.760> lip<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:00.120> well<00:04:03.950> but

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and then doing the lower lip as well but

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.010 
and then doing the lower lip as well but
for<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.340> I'm<00:04:05.490> not<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.360> outside<00:04:06.870> the

lines

so as you can see it's not much color

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.530 
so as you can see it's not much color
it's<00:04:19.850> just<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.209> light<00:04:20.449> stain<00:04:21.850> but<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.000> does<00:04:23.210> help

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540

right now but it's a great base for
adding<00:04:36.169> more<00:04:36.320> color<00:04:36.620> or<00:04:37.030> what<00:04:38.030> I'm<00:04:38.120> going<00:04:38.360> to

lip<00:04:42.919> liner<00:04:43.190> but<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.580> point<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.910> using<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> lip

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540
