350 X this is a particularly year model
of<00:00:30.330> 1985<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:33.720> there<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.079> difficulties

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
of 1985 and there are some difficulties

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.810 
of 1985 and there are some difficulties
in<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.510> due<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.810> fact<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.200> Honda<00:00:37.820> no

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
in this due to the fact that Honda no

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.330 
in this due to the fact that Honda no
longer<00:00:39.440> makes<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> parts<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.130> you
