can<00:02:05.270> be<00:02:05.420> styled<00:02:05.659> in<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.020> bunch<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.409> different

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
can be styled in a bunch of different

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.460 
can be styled in a bunch of different
ways<00:02:06.890> now<00:02:07.460> if<00:02:07.579> I<00:02:07.700> sweep<00:02:08.689> this<00:02:08.899> off<00:02:09.079> to<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> side

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
ways now if I sweep this off to the side

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.120 
ways now if I sweep this off to the side
a<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.189> see<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.770> rooted

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
a little bit you can see that the rooted

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.710 
a little bit you can see that the rooted
shade<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.489> really<00:02:13.790> playing<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.420> favor

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
shade is really playing in my favor

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.880 
shade is really playing in my favor
because<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.620> does

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
because it does

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.340 
because it does
that<00:02:15.980> cover<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:17.210> this<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.540> my<00:02:17.690> bio<00:02:17.900> hair<00:02:18.230> it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
that cover like this is my bio hair it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.230 
that cover like this is my bio hair it
doesn't<00:02:18.650> cover<00:02:18.890> completely<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.880> mentioned

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
doesn't cover completely and I mentioned

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.760 
doesn't cover completely and I mentioned
that<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.600> original<00:02:21.050> review<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.560> wig

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
that in the original review of this wig

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.030 
that in the original review of this wig
because<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.670> rooted<00:02:25.750> that's<00:02:26.750> awesome<00:02:27.200> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
because it's rooted that's awesome and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.300 
because it's rooted that's awesome and
so<00:02:28.819> now<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.540> why<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:29.870> many<00:02:30.050> people

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
so now you can see why so many people

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.070 
so now you can see why so many people
intentionally<00:02:31.310> buy<00:02:31.880> wigs<00:02:32.240> that<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.690> routing

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
intentionally buy wigs that have routing

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.190 
intentionally buy wigs that have routing
so<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.820> really<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.660> love<00:02:36.050> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
so I really really like this I love the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530 
so I really really like this I love the
color<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.850> think<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.000> very<00:02:38.180> very<00:02:38.300> beautiful

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
color I think it's a very very beautiful

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.680 
color I think it's a very very beautiful
cut<00:02:38.959> I'm<00:02:39.440> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.650> turn<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> side<00:02:40.690> I'm

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
cut I'm going to turn to the side I'm

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.660 
cut I'm going to turn to the side I'm
going<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> rattle<00:02:42.200> off<00:02:42.290> some<00:02:42.830> stats<00:02:43.310> while

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
going to rattle off some stats while

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.960 
going to rattle off some stats while
doing<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.360> these<00:02:45.319> sides<00:02:45.680> are<00:02:45.950> seven<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
doing so these sides are seven and a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.100 
doing so these sides are seven and a
half<00:02:47.000> inches<00:02:47.720> long<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:49.070> nape<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.900> 3.5<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
half inches long the nape is 3.5 and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.240 
half inches long the nape is 3.5 and
I'll<00:02:51.200> show<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.739> get<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
I'll show you that when I get to the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.830 
I'll show you that when I get to the
back<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.610> front<00:02:52.820> here<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.209> quite<00:02:53.480> long<00:02:53.660> as

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
back in the front here is quite long as

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.320 
back in the front here is quite long as
well<00:02:54.019> front<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.890> seven<00:02:55.190> point<00:02:55.519> seven<00:02:56.120> five

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
well front is seven point seven five

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.720 
well front is seven point seven five
inches<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.810> that's<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.140> there<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
inches so that's that there but the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
inches so that's that there but the
layer<00:02:58.940> next<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.510> around<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.900> face<00:03:00.080> is

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
layer next to that around the face is

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.810 
layer next to that around the face is
substantially<00:03:01.190> longer<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.610> they<00:03:01.670> don't

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
substantially longer and they don't

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.840 
substantially longer and they don't
provide<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.090> measurement<00:03:02.450> for<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.400> maybe

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
provide a measurement for that so maybe

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:14.990 
provide a measurement for that so maybe
I<00:03:04.970> should<00:03:07.450> okay

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.610 

it's<00:03:15.150> about<00:03:15.360> twelve<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.990> half<00:03:16.020> inches<00:03:16.200> so

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it's about twelve and a half inches so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.970 
it's about twelve and a half inches so
it's<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.720> good<00:03:18.720> length<00:03:19.020> for<00:03:19.290> framing<00:03:19.830> out<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
it's a good length for framing out the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.260 
it's a good length for framing out the
face<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.990> here<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.380> back<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.950> Kristen

difficult

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
difficult

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.409 
difficult
and<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:12.099> noticed<00:05:12.400> for<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.580> own<00:05:12.699> experience<00:05:12.819> with

and I noticed for my own experience with
the<00:05:13.539> one<00:05:13.719> that<00:05:13.810> I<00:05:13.870> kept<00:05:14.229> that<00:05:14.849> you<00:05:15.849> can<00:05:16.150> very

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
easily train this hair to stay over to

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.580 
easily train this hair to stay over to
the<00:05:18.819> side<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.389> just<00:05:19.509> takes<00:05:19.930> about<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.199> week<00:05:20.289> of
