about this memory right here which is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.810 
about this memory right here which is
nothing<00:00:17.609> new<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:19.010> it's<00:00:20.010> also<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.400> coarse

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
air I want to say quality of service but

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
air I want to say quality of service but
when<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> say<00:00:23.430> quality<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.970> service<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.570> don't

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
when I say quality of service I don't

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.009 
when I say quality of service I don't
mean<00:00:25.369> control<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.699> network<00:00:27.210> traffic<00:00:27.510> in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.999 
mean control of network traffic in
routers<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:29.099> name<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> QoS

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
routers I don't name that kind of QoS

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.030 
routers I don't name that kind of QoS
but<00:00:32.239> essentially<00:00:33.469> actually<00:00:34.469> before<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.950> even

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
but essentially actually before I even

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
but essentially actually before I even
get<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.649> why<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
get to that if you want to see why I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.100 
get to that if you want to see why I
even<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.510> memory<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
even have this the can memory get in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
even have this the can memory get in
front<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.920> check<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> video

I<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> why<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> didn't<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> video

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I have this and why I didn't do a video

I have this and why I didn't do a video
on<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> before<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.350> just

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
memories I mean it's you know not much

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
memories I mean it's you know not much
to<00:01:03.930> review<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.379> unless<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> guys<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to review really unless you guys want to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.770 
to review really unless you guys want to
see<00:01:05.909> actual<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:06.930> specs<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:08.189> rather

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
see actual you know specs or rather

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.399 
see actual you know specs or rather
numeric<00:01:09.780> results<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> reason<00:01:13.260> why<00:01:13.350> I'm

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
numeric results but the reason why I'm

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.740 
numeric results but the reason why I'm
doing<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.760> two<00:01:14.909> things<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
doing this is for two things one the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
doing this is for two things one the
product<00:01:16.020> itself<00:01:16.439> itself<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> course<00:01:17.970> airs

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
product itself itself and course airs

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
product itself itself and course airs
actual<00:01:19.020> customer<00:01:19.650> service<00:01:19.950> their<00:01:20.280> quality<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
actual customer service their quality of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
actual customer service their quality of
service<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> case<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
service in this case which on the and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.200 
service in this case which on the and
the<00:01:24.030> context<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.689> different<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.549> did<00:01:27.060> not

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the context is different so I did not

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
the context is different so I did not
make<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> video<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.350> was

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
make a video on this because this was

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.499 
make a video on this because this was
already<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> laptop<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.970> hadn't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
already in the laptop and I just hadn't

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
already in the laptop and I just hadn't
really<00:01:30.630> find<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> video<00:01:31.380> necessary<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really find the video necessary but I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
really find the video necessary but I
had<00:01:33.450> errors<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.560> Acer<00:01:35.040> laptop<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.880> was

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
had errors on the Acer laptop I was

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
had errors on the Acer laptop I was
constantly<00:01:36.479> getting<00:01:36.780> blue<00:01:37.049> screens<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
constantly getting blue screens and I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
constantly getting blue screens and I
did<00:01:38.310> run<00:01:38.460> mem<00:01:38.700> tests<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> turned<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
did run mem tests and it turned out that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
did run mem tests and it turned out that
either<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> memory<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.189> bad<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.000> have

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
either the memory was bad I'm not have

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
either the memory was bad I'm not have
been<00:01:42.210> getting<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> false<00:01:42.689> positive<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.409> don't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
been getting a false positive I don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
been getting a false positive I don't
know<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> ran<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> several<00:01:45.000> times

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
know but I ran it several times

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
know but I ran it several times
I<00:01:45.509> couldn't<00:01:46.110> determine<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:46.649> stick<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> was

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I couldn't determine which stick it was

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
I couldn't determine which stick it was
that<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.549> bad<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> did<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.750> errors<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that was bad but I did get errors so I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.060 
that was bad but I did get errors so I
said<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.710> what

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
said you know what

so<00:03:39.709> here<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:40.800> go<00:03:40.890> nothing<00:03:41.220> too<00:03:41.370> much<00:03:41.580> I'm<00:03:41.760> just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
so here we go nothing too much I'm just

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.420 
so here we go nothing too much I'm just
gonna<00:03:42.000> fool<00:03:42.269> yeah<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.080> would<00:03:43.230> suck<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.340> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
gonna fool yeah that would suck and I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.790 
gonna fool yeah that would suck and I
love<00:03:44.670> how<00:03:44.850> they<00:03:45.030> did<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.269> black<00:03:45.510> PCB<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.650> know

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
love how they did a black PCB you know

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.680 
love how they did a black PCB you know
you<00:03:46.860> mean<00:03:47.220> you're<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:47.400> gonna<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.060> module

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you mean you're not gonna see the module

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.449 
you mean you're not gonna see the module
anyways<00:03:49.080> let<00:03:49.800> me<00:03:49.830> go<00:03:49.980> ahead<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.250> that

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
anyways let me go ahead and do that

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670 
anyways let me go ahead and do that
there<00:03:50.580> we<00:03:50.640> go<00:03:50.760> come<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.090> zoom<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.810> green<00:03:52.320> focus

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
there we go come on zoom in green focus

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.220 
there we go come on zoom in green focus
first<00:03:53.610> there<00:03:54.360> we<00:03:54.450> go<00:03:54.590> nice<00:03:55.590> black<00:03:55.920> PCB<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:57.690> want

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
first there we go nice black PCB I want

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.750 
first there we go nice black PCB I want
to<00:03:58.290> say<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> plastic<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.550> little

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
to say this is plastic like a little

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.650 
to say this is plastic like a little
sticker<00:04:00.030> pretty<00:04:00.510> sure<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.140> sticker

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
sticker pretty sure it is just a sticker

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.910 
sticker pretty sure it is just a sticker
actually<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.720> could<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:04.019> like<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> very<00:04:04.620> thin

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
actually it could be like a very thin

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.890 
actually it could be like a very thin
metal<00:04:05.360> let<00:04:06.360> me<00:04:06.420> see

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
metal let me see

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.600 
metal let me see
now<00:04:07.349> I've<00:04:07.500> actually<00:04:07.620> I'd<00:04:07.920> them<00:04:08.069> one<00:04:08.190> okay<00:04:08.489> no

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
now I've actually I'd them one okay no

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.160 
now I've actually I'd them one okay no
it's<00:04:08.730> plastic<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.269> just<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.540> sticker<00:04:09.810> okay

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
it's plastic it's just a sticker okay

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.369 
it's plastic it's just a sticker okay
but<00:04:11.599> this<00:04:12.599> should<00:04:12.780> dissipate<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.349> heat

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
but this should dissipate the heat

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.199 
but this should dissipate the heat
pretty<00:04:13.799> good<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.280> mean<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:14.670> not<00:04:14.879> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
pretty good I mean it's not that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.060 
pretty good I mean it's not that
shouldn't<00:04:15.510> affect<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.440> I'm<00:04:16.709> glad<00:04:16.859> they

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
shouldn't affect it but I'm glad they

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
shouldn't affect it but I'm glad they
were<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> black<00:04:17.549> PCB<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.090> hate<00:04:18.359> how<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.570> get

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
were with a black PCB I hate how you get

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.689 
were with a black PCB I hate how you get
performance<00:04:19.139> RAM<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.100> get<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.370> green

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
performance RAM and you get like a green

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.030 
performance RAM and you get like a green
PCB<00:04:21.269> still<00:04:21.660> even<00:04:22.530> though<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.740> have<00:04:22.889> like<00:04:23.010> a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
PCB still even though they have like a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.530 
PCB still even though they have like a
nice<00:04:23.280> heat<00:04:23.520> spreader<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:23.910> them<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.240> hate<00:04:24.449> it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
nice heat spreader on them I hate it

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.860 
nice heat spreader on them I hate it
when<00:04:25.100> they<00:04:26.100> do<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.430> most<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.330> time<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.810> I

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
when they do that most of the time and I

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.180 
when they do that most of the time and I
mean<00:04:28.110> if<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.320> have<00:04:28.410> an<00:04:28.500> open<00:04:28.710> system<00:04:28.919> like

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
mean if you have an open system like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.950 
mean if you have an open system like
this<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> window<00:04:29.850> you're<00:04:30.419> gonna<00:04:30.570> see<00:04:30.810> it

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
this with a window you're gonna see it

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.689 
this with a window you're gonna see it
but<00:04:31.110> for<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> laptop<00:04:31.919> normally<00:04:32.460> you're<00:04:32.580> not

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
but for a laptop normally you're not

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.040 
but for a laptop normally you're not
gonna<00:04:32.820> see<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:33.330> even<00:04:33.660> though<00:04:33.810> you're<00:04:33.960> not

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
gonna see it but even though you're not

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.450 
gonna see it but even though you're not
gonna<00:04:34.199> see<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.740> nice<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.280> this

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
gonna see it it's nice to have this

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.250 
gonna see it it's nice to have this
because<00:04:35.639> it's<00:04:35.940> for<00:04:36.449> me<00:04:36.540> someone<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.110> OCD

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
because it's for me someone that's OCD

I'm a geek and for those of you watching
most<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.900> probably<00:04:39.990> feel<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.410> same<00:04:40.530> way

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
most of you probably feel the same way

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.100 
most of you probably feel the same way
this<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.460> very<00:04:41.610> nice<00:04:41.940> little<00:04:42.180> small<00:04:42.570> light

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
this is very nice little small light

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.100 
this is very nice little small light
touches<00:04:43.530> like<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:43.889> actually<00:04:44.850> make<00:04:45.449> me<00:04:45.810> want

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
touches like this actually make me want

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.510 
touches like this actually make me want
their<00:04:46.500> products<00:04:47.070> over<00:04:47.520> anyone<00:04:47.880> elses<00:04:49.520> but

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
their products over anyone elses but

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520 
their products over anyone elses but
yeah<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.789> is<00:04:50.880> basically<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:52.199> get<00:04:52.350> maybe

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
yeah that is basically it you get maybe

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.379 
yeah that is basically it you get maybe
you<00:04:52.680> based<00:04:52.979> laptop<00:04:53.460> keep<00:04:53.669> in<00:04:53.789> mind<00:04:54.000> get<00:04:54.240> some

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
you based laptop keep in mind get some

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.450 
you based laptop keep in mind get some
high<00:04:54.510> speed<00:04:54.750> memory<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.889> certainly<00:04:56.190> get

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
high speed memory you can certainly get

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.969 
high speed memory you can certainly get

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
18 6 6 I went with a 1600 because

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.950 
18 6 6 I went with a 1600 because
there's<00:04:59.910> only<00:05:00.060> gonna<00:05:00.150> be<00:05:00.270> maybe<00:05:00.510> if<00:05:00.690> anything

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960
