00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:09.039 
this is our HMO and here is the answer

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.850 
this is our HMO and here is the answer
to<00:00:09.309> a<00:00:09.369> question<00:00:09.490> how<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.000> get<00:00:10.269> rid<00:00:10.480> of<00:00:10.510> jello<00:00:10.959> so

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
to a question how to get rid of jello so

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.760 
to a question how to get rid of jello so
far<00:00:12.129> there<00:00:12.459> are<00:00:12.490> many<00:00:12.699> methods<00:00:12.879> but<00:00:13.629> what<00:00:14.500> have

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
far there are many methods but what have

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.420 
far there are many methods but what have
worked<00:00:15.039> for<00:00:15.250> me<00:00:15.400> best<00:00:15.699> is<00:00:16.029> here<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.980> instance

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
worked for me best is here for instance

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.880 
worked for me best is here for instance
the<00:00:19.359> brushless<00:00:19.570> gimbal<00:00:19.840> they<00:00:20.349> come<00:00:20.560> with<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
the brushless gimbal they come with the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.440 
the brushless gimbal they come with the
rubber<00:00:21.220> dampen<00:00:21.670> balls

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
rubber dampen balls

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.930 
rubber dampen balls
okay<00:00:22.690> rubber<00:00:22.900> damping<00:00:23.230> balls<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.880> are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
okay rubber damping balls they are

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.880 
okay rubber damping balls they are
actually<00:00:25.330> very<00:00:25.539> soft<00:00:25.960> so<00:00:26.350> sometimes<00:00:26.740> they

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
actually very soft so sometimes they

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.939 
actually very soft so sometimes they
make<00:00:27.070> gimbal<00:00:27.490> shake<00:00:28.029> at<00:00:28.410> speeds<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:29.650> what<00:00:29.800> I<00:00:29.830> do

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
make gimbal shake at speeds so what I do

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.709 
make gimbal shake at speeds so what I do
is<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.640> put<00:00:31.420> these<00:00:31.690> for<00:00:32.590> me<00:00:32.710> things<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:34.449> two

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
is I put these for me things on the two

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.219 
is I put these for me things on the two
booms<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.469> then<00:00:36.309> use<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:36.850> zip<00:00:37.120> ties<00:00:37.359> to<00:00:37.870> pinch

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
booms and then use the zip ties to pinch

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.549 
booms and then use the zip ties to pinch
the<00:00:38.530> rubber<00:00:39.249> balls<00:00:39.519> on<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:40.210> inside<00:00:41.019> there<00:00:41.289> and

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
the rubber balls on the inside there and

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.329 
the rubber balls on the inside there and
that's<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.819> I<00:00:43.030> get<00:00:43.300> jello<00:00:43.870> free<00:00:44.260> video<00:00:44.710> totally

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
that's it I get jello free video totally

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.849 
that's it I get jello free video totally
jello<00:00:45.760> free<00:00:46.089> if<00:00:46.929> you<00:00:47.079> want<00:00:47.109> to<00:00:47.289> mount<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
jello free if you want to mount the

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.569 
jello free if you want to mount the
GoPro<00:00:48.479> directly<00:00:49.479> static<00:00:50.350> under<00:00:50.769> something

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
GoPro directly static under something

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.930 
GoPro directly static under something
this<00:00:52.329> worked<00:00:52.989> for<00:00:53.530> me<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:54.069> far<00:00:54.309> really<00:00:54.609> nicely

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
this worked for me so far really nicely

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.399 
this worked for me so far really nicely
once<00:00:55.329> again<00:00:56.309> form<00:00:57.309> on<00:00:57.670> two<00:00:57.940> booms<00:00:58.269> zip<00:00:59.170> ties

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
once again form on two booms zip ties

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.569 
once again form on two booms zip ties
but<00:01:00.010> at<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.670> kind<00:01:00.999> of<00:01:01.120> frame<00:01:01.569> if<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:01.989> can<00:01:02.199> see

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but at this kind of frame if you can see

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.520 
but at this kind of frame if you can see
where<00:01:03.579> GoPro<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:06.600> mounted<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.810> top

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
where GoPro is actually mounted on top

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.950 
where GoPro is actually mounted on top
of<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.160> double-sided<00:01:09.640> tape<00:01:09.790> down<00:01:10.240> here<00:01:10.750> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
of the double-sided tape down here and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.070 
of the double-sided tape down here and
the<00:01:11.830> double-sided<00:01:12.310> tape<00:01:12.460> down<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:13.810> there

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the double-sided tape down up there

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.410 
the double-sided tape down up there
alright<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.400> way<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.910> GoPro<00:01:16.300> is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
alright so this way the GoPro is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.840 
alright so this way the GoPro is
actually<00:01:16.810> isolated<00:01:17.740> completely<00:01:18.100> isolated

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
actually isolated completely isolated

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.550 
actually isolated completely isolated
from<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> vibrations<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.840> also<00:01:20.230> remember

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
from the vibrations and also remember

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.410 
from the vibrations and also remember
that<00:01:20.740> these<00:01:20.920> two<00:01:20.980> booms<00:01:21.400> are<00:01:21.640> also<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.210> their

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
that these two booms are also have their

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.980 
that these two booms are also have their
own<00:01:22.570> things<00:01:23.020> right<00:01:23.980> here<00:01:24.970> there's<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.750> rubber

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
own things right here there's a rubber

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.160 
own things right here there's a rubber
thingy<00:01:26.380> ring<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.790> actually<00:01:28.180> absorbs<00:01:29.080> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
thingy ring that actually absorbs the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.200 
thingy ring that actually absorbs the
vibration<00:01:29.680> one<00:01:30.130> vibration<00:01:30.700> absorbing<00:01:31.120> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
vibration one vibration absorbing is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.450 
vibration one vibration absorbing is
there<00:01:31.450> on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.960> booms<00:01:32.200> -<00:01:33.010> on<00:01:33.550> these<00:01:35.460> foamy

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
there on the booms - on these foamy

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210 
there on the booms - on these foamy
things<00:01:36.820> three<00:01:37.750> GoPro<00:01:38.380> isolated<00:01:38.980> from

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
things three GoPro isolated from

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
things three GoPro isolated from
vibration<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:40.330> right<00:01:40.690> here<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.590> same<00:01:41.800> thing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
vibration and right here the same thing

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.620 
vibration and right here the same thing
same<00:01:44.110> method<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.650> have<00:01:44.680> supplied<00:01:45.370> on<00:01:45.670> seeker

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
same method I have supplied on seeker

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.399 
same method I have supplied on seeker
450<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.550> see<00:01:48.940> I'll<00:01:49.390> try<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.810> take<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
450 so you can see I'll try to take the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.399 
450 so you can see I'll try to take the
lights<00:01:50.920> getting<00:01:51.610> dark<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.210> little<00:01:52.390> bit<00:01:55.409> so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
lights getting dark a little bit so

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.680 
lights getting dark a little bit so
first<00:01:56.710> level<00:01:58.170> these<00:01:59.170> rubber<00:02:00.060> dampers<00:02:01.060> rubber

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
first level these rubber dampers rubber

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.730 
first level these rubber dampers rubber
damping<00:02:02.080> balls<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.790> then<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.659> GoPro<00:02:05.170> has<00:02:05.500> its

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
damping balls and then the GoPro has its

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.940 
damping balls and then the GoPro has its
own<00:02:05.920> frame<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.600> frame<00:02:07.930> has<00:02:08.110> upper<00:02:08.679> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
own frame and this frame has upper and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.629 
own frame and this frame has upper and
lower<00:02:09.330> double<00:02:10.330> sided<00:02:10.539> tape<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:12.459> actually

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.639 
lower double sided tape so it actually

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.879 
lower double sided tape so it actually
isolates<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.540> GoPro<00:02:13.900> from<00:02:14.019> any<00:02:14.290> vibration

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:14.889 
isolates the GoPro from any vibration

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.890 
isolates the GoPro from any vibration
and<00:02:15.069> then<00:02:15.609> this<00:02:15.849> frame<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.329> sitting

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and then this frame is sitting

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.569 
and then this frame is sitting
these<00:02:17.140> rubber<00:02:18.099> damper<00:02:18.659> balls<00:02:20.400> plateform

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
these rubber damper balls plateform

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.089 
these rubber damper balls plateform
then<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> added<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.959> double-sided<00:02:23.500> tape<00:02:23.799> on<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
then I added a double-sided tape on the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.690 
then I added a double-sided tape on the
arm<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.760> put<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.329> zip<00:02:25.629> tie<00:02:25.840> there<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.560> add<00:02:27.519> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
arm and put a zip tie there and add it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.449 
arm and put a zip tie there and add it
as<00:02:27.819> double<00:02:28.390> sided<00:02:28.569> tape<00:02:28.689> on<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.200> arm<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.040> put

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
as double sided tape on this arm and put

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.110 
as double sided tape on this arm and put
a<00:02:30.489> zip<00:02:30.760> tie<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.739> these<00:02:33.069> propellers<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.879> not

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
a zip tie one of these propellers is not

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.009 
a zip tie one of these propellers is not
much<00:02:34.659> balanced<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.769> seeker<00:02:36.159> but<00:02:37.060> today
