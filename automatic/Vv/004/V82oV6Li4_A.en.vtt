00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
let's give it a try

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.120 
let's give it a try
although<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.650> put<00:02:23.800> very<00:02:24.070> little

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
although we do is put very little

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.560 
although we do is put very little
toothpaste<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.330> bit<00:02:25.420> wet

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
toothpaste on it get a little bit wet

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.199 
toothpaste on it get a little bit wet
and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.080> outward<00:02:26.650> motion<00:02:27.640> from<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
and then just go outward motion from the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.940 
and then just go outward motion from the
center<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.660> disk<00:02:28.840> out<00:02:28.990> not<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.560> circles

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
center of the disk out not in circles

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.100 
center of the disk out not in circles
center<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.880> disk<00:02:31.090> out<00:02:31.300> there<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.780> go

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
center of the disk out there we go

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.770 
center of the disk out there we go
I<00:02:32.140> repeat<00:02:32.560> center<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.610> disk<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:34.090> not<00:02:34.480> in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
I repeat center of the disk out not in

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.760 
I repeat center of the disk out not in
circles<00:02:35.290> oh<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.700> went<00:02:39.820> further<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:41.470> we<00:02:41.560> just

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
circles oh it went further can we just

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.199 
circles oh it went further can we just
look<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.160> still<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> background

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
look it's still going in the background

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.140 
look it's still going in the background
so<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.510> figured<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.730> can't<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
so we figured because we can't get the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.970 
so we figured because we can't get the
game<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.420> work<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.840> should<00:02:47.050> go<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.590> red<00:02:47.739> box

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
game to work we should go to the red box

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.220 
game to work we should go to the red box
and<00:02:48.250> try<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.820> try<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:49.540> rent<00:02:49.720> one<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
and try to try to just rent one for the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.259 
and try to try to just rent one for the
day<00:02:50.350> because<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.310> don't<00:02:51.610> know<00:02:51.700> where<00:02:52.180> he

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
day because I don't know where he

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.300 
day because I don't know where he
thought<00:02:52.570> it'd<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.870> fun<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.140> play<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:54.130> well

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
thought it'd be fun to play and well

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.650 
thought it'd be fun to play and well
yeah<00:02:54.519> there's<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.760> red<00:02:54.910> box<00:02:55.060> right<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.300> throat<00:02:55.510> so

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
yeah there's a red box right a throat so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.110 
yeah there's a red box right a throat so
we<00:02:55.780> started<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.170> process<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.790> trying

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
we started this process of like trying

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240 
we started this process of like trying
to<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> our<00:02:58.600> red<00:02:58.780> box<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.260> find<00:02:59.650> one<00:02:59.830> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
to go to our red box and find one and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250 
to go to our red box and find one and
now<00:03:00.820> that<00:03:01.030> we're<00:03:01.150> actually<00:03:01.269> on<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.900> mission

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
now that we're actually on the mission

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.100 
now that we're actually on the mission
we<00:03:02.890> can't<00:03:03.160> stop<00:03:03.489> like<00:03:04.360> we<00:03:04.510> have<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.900> keep<00:03:05.050> going

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
we can't stop like we have to keep going

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.910 
we can't stop like we have to keep going
because<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.400> red<00:03:06.640> box<00:03:06.850> had<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.620> when<00:03:08.769> we

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
because this red box had it but when we

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.250 
because this red box had it but when we
are<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.160> home<00:03:09.370> we<00:03:10.019> accidentally<00:03:11.019> click

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
are at home we accidentally click

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.740 
are at home we accidentally click
reserved<00:03:11.860> but<00:03:12.790> we<00:03:12.910> didn't<00:03:13.120> fill<00:03:13.269> out<00:03:13.420> any<00:03:13.630> of

this stuff so I think that it's still in
that<00:03:15.610> machine<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.989> it's<00:03:17.170> been<00:03:17.440> reserved<00:03:17.980> so
