to overclock it's really up to you and
you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.600> probably<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.960> even<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.530> bit

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you can probably get even a little bit

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520 
you can probably get even a little bit
higher<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.729> two<00:01:05.909> PCI<00:01:06.510> Express<00:01:06.869> x16

it's<00:02:43.459> actually<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.870> quite<00:02:45.050> useful<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:45.350> you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
it's actually it's quite useful if you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.690 
it's actually it's quite useful if you
build<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> lot<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.890> PC's<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.220> use<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> lot<00:02:46.580> of

build a lot of PC's and use a lot of

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.520 
build a lot of PC's and use a lot of
types<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.910> memory<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.209> really<00:02:47.450> useful<00:02:47.780> let's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
types of memory it's really useful let's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.290 
types of memory it's really useful let's
move<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.010> back<00:02:49.100> panel<00:02:49.340> we're<00:02:50.030> gonna<00:02:50.120> go

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
move on to the back panel we're gonna go

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.750 
move on to the back panel we're gonna go
across<00:02:50.540> from<00:02:51.410> over<00:02:51.620> here<00:02:51.890> all<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.520> way<00:02:52.610> across

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
across from over here all the way across

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
across from over here all the way across
so<00:02:53.030> first<00:02:53.330> thing<00:02:53.450> you'll<00:02:53.570> see<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.810> two<00:02:53.989> USB<00:02:54.290> 2.0

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
so first thing you'll see is two USB 2.0

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.900 
so first thing you'll see is two USB 2.0
ports<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.880> oh<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.739> familiar<00:02:57.739> ps2<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> dual

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
ports the oh is familiar ps2 to the dual

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.670 
ports the oh is familiar ps2 to the dual
ps2<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.870> if<00:02:59.930> you're<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> little<00:03:00.170> bit<00:03:00.320> antiquated

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
ps2 so if you're a little bit antiquated

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.110 
ps2 so if you're a little bit antiquated
and<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.160> have<00:03:01.250> some<00:03:01.400> old<00:03:01.580> tech<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.970> might

and you have some old tech you might

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080 
and you have some old tech you might
want<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.800> HDMI<00:03:03.800> with<00:03:04.370> your<00:03:04.640> digital

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
and there's also a real tech chipset to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.940 
and there's also a real tech chipset to
run<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> 10<00:03:29.239> 100<00:03:29.540> or<00:03:29.570> 1000<00:03:30.230> Ethernet<00:03:30.709> so

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
run the 10 100 or 1000 Ethernet so

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.300 
run the 10 100 or 1000 Ethernet so
that's<00:03:31.940> really<00:03:32.150> good<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.540> use<00:03:32.690> as<00:03:32.870> well<00:03:33.310> it's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
that's really good to use as well it's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.650 
that's really good to use as well it's
also<00:03:34.430> important<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.850> notice<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.180> board<00:03:35.450> does

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
also important to notice this board does

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.900 
also important to notice this board does
use<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.080> Lucid<00:03:36.380> logic<00:03:36.680> virtue<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.760> does

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
use the Lucid logic virtue so it does

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.190 
use the Lucid logic virtue so it does
have<00:03:38.060> dynamic<00:03:38.239> switching<00:03:38.600> between<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> IMO's

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
have dynamic switching between the IMO's

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.520 
have dynamic switching between the IMO's
