00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.430
 this song is in the tone of the greatest 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.340
 and is divided into three parts stanza 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.559
 pre chorus and chorus we begin with the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.199
 stanzas for the verses we are going to 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.940
 use a small musical circle that 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.290
 carries the biggest 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.070
 from schumi 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.070
 to sustained minor 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.850
 one 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.129
 to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.020
 m 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.590
 with a bit of rhythm that I will give to the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.590
 Following way 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 yes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 i 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.160
 we're going to put some lyrics 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 that observe how would say structured 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.520
 would be 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 remember 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.320

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.420
 weather 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 several centuries 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 Carry and drama 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.439
 ok now let's learn the pre-leather 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.750
 and we will use the following circle 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.110
 musical this circle we are going to divide it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.250
 in four parts the first part would be 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.390
 rowing 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.270
 we do the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.530
 we make two sharp 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.290
 we will touch good 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.290
 the second would be man 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.030
 the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.420
 two 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.120

 and the good we're going to do the four we're going 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.269
 to do in a way a bit of space 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.269
 so that they can observe serious 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.939
 i 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.190
 Y 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.190

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.230
 number 42 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.939

 ok now let's learn the chorus and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.110
 we will use the following circle 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.340
 musical this we are going to divide it into three 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.340

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.319
 2 holding F sharp number number 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.010
 2 network 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.060

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.970
 the study 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.430
