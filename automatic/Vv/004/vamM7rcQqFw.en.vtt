00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
 posadas press 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.480
 but it is proposed to analyze it 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.400
 I can tell you what my work is 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.239
 peace on board per hour analysis of 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.759
 of the press sector that the group l can be or not but but I always 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:13.929
 I'm whole 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.570
 with the disposition the predisposition of defeated by by the selection 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 sudden some people like it but witness the homicide 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.789
 more than two months ago 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.519
 c the access to this that closed that way 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.289
 this granted 1 nuno suits way a very very serious this I tried to be 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.890
 professional 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 throughout my career 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 and that's something that was valued quite 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 without them many children cycles 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.430
 live born and dead hyperion 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 so their goals were just a confidence in the evolutionary process 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.710
 chelsea 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.190
 the sexpe the work that a but does not perform in form we are not particular the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.650
 football is a collective sport definitely 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.469
 0 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.790
 but one wins the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.690
 the call 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 doing a very good job 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.490
 and what invites you to esteche in the work that I'm doing until the day 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.810
 from today 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 is being evaluated by the technical team of the national team 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 I'm here you feel 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 the two indigenous encounters alien to the crisis and raise awareness 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 the need to determine if they have a history 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.660
 no no no 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.690
 By the way, on the subject of selection, we all feel like holders 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.140
 poses in the trust still why because beyond his mother vat of what 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 that it may be that he owns the post 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 but if you have to feel inside cdc suffer that place from this one 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.689
 she gives them to me in that place I do not feel the mayor the owner 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.500
 he simply worked for the teacher 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990
 novel 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 the opportunity to play on the team 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.530
 blunders and talking if we talk about their amount 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 that we all have opportunities 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.770
 we all have a great capacity the fact of being in the selection already 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.370
 talks about the player's ability 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.310
 the last word has other 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 titi tourist pib 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 I do not think the French teams are based on that 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:13.759
 in this process 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.119
 I think you can see a little when it comes to support 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 we have handled very well very defensively several matches 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.999
 with respect to 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.319
 previous trot game 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 You see a difference 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.609
 it's good that the team keeps the zero 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.609
 during 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.419
 never see five games four because we are human cedh scotland 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.179
 and this is good 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.559
 it turns out that the defensive work until then is honest and 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 the teacher asks each one of the members how they lose it 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.250
 is an undisputed in the establishment 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.669
 e from markarián 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.659
 and we would even say that even in the eleven 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.099
 since Macaria Walter Vlchez has only been out in the first microcycle 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.000
 of markarián when min pacho not yet defined 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.300
 and there's a lot on which team I was going to play this year but then on the rest 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.969
 has been attentive to the calls any 1006 even tomorrow 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.569
 we imagine the early morning at five in the morning in the transmission of cmd when 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.669
 arrive the images and leave but the court vlchez must be the captain 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.319
 of the Peruvian team for this game against Japan but has played p 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.300
 times the kirin cup in 1999 when the technician was 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.320
 Juan Carlos Oblitas which our teammate Flavio Maestri in that team 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.400
 of oblitas and in 2005 with fredy calf after there is a friendly but 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.610
 japan when uribe was the coach of the national team but not as part 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.179
 of the cup the fifth massa and in the kirin cup 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.179
 This is a report by Javier Thumb Vidal 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.869
 in 1999 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.139
 but it was for the first time to the kirin cup clash with belgium and japan 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.259
 on June 6 in yokohama Peruvians and Japanese equaled to zero place the 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.969
 selection that directs to Juan Carlos Oblitas and Ohl the first place with 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.469
 Belgium 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.619
 with which he had tied one scoring for our selection 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.499
 flavio maestri 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.759
 in 2005 but today to japan to participate in the kirin cup 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.959
 On May 22 the rival was local to Japan 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.279
 and the triumph corresponded to our team with a goal to zero 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.539
 with a goal converted by gustavo vasallo the discounts 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.719
 that team that ran fredy calf formed with flowers because it came to lupe 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.080
 villalta has more Basque lellouche 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.469
 pass the pink card of Jesus 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.430
 before a selection 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.249
 before similar health 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.409
 replaced by rooms 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.580
 two days later 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.730
 On May 24, the Peruvian national team equaled zero with Arab emirates 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:50.610
 United 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.719
 the team but what entered the field was similar to the one where local 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.349
 after the tie against the Arabs 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.559
 Peru started then returned to the country 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.559
 and he learned about the victory and the emirates 1-0 against Japan 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.429
 with that result peru and united arab emirates reached the first 

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:08.319
 place and the 200 thousand dollars were distributed 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.300
 assigned to the winner of the contest 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.029
 in conclusion but reached twice the first place in the kirin cup 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.330
 tied with another team in the first with belgium country as the one that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.210
 distributes a prize of 150 thousand dollars 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.620
 he scored two goals 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.589
 and did not receive any 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.589
 I like the kirin cup a simple tournament of preparation 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.469
 but that always glad to win 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.309
 6 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:41.689
 peru japan and belgium gauging 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.740
 of those who were that kirin cup of 99 peru japan and arab emirates 

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:50.770
 they were in the kirin cup of 2005 now they are peru japan and the republic 

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:56.299
 czech perujo to morning 5 and 20 the morning is the beginning of the game before the 

00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:01.599
 selection of japan and then I heard he's going to play three days later on June 4 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.489
 before the selection of the Czech Republic then return to Lima and as has 

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:11.879
 happened already on previous occasions will wait for what happens in the last 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.189
 match between the local team between japan in the czech republic that goes to 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.189
 play on June 7 in the kirin cup 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.099
 for this one that for the Peruvian team will allow bird 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.330
 some do 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.730
 I do not have others mentally 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.639
 still can not frame and will attend 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.599
 look all together 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.910
 one could see 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.259
 adempas zambrano with rodríguez slim 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.740
 between the 2000 the two injured this time at least in the middle of the 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.219
 court will be able to see 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.599
 avaí with ramírez competed with ballón same 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.169
 in the minutes that markarián 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.710
 I decided to give them this time it will be farfán but it will not be vargas not to nationalize or not 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.510
 will be blacksmith costs us costs us costs the technician and basically goes 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.279
 to do 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:59.749
 in the farewell match before going to the America Cup and matches 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:01.540
 competition officials 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.490
 of the america cup 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.470
 where markarián power adn maybe finally line up the eleven 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.850
 what goes on in your head a situation that does not occur in other teams help us 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.040
 and masters for example 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.599
 to a robbery on ivo on Sunday and both to Uruguay 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:20.650
 against germany in a friendly match 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.759
 and Uruguay with just one variant a variant of the world title team 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.030
 he did not play rifles 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.759
 1 martín cáceres 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.260
 then in the rest 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.960
 the same Uruguayans have spent a year 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.419
 I have almost the same Uruguayan World Cup 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.400
 what did you play 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.509
 in south africa 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:43.539
 2010 and duva was going to be precisely the selection with which the team uses 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:47.229
 operated 1 so you have to be responsible you have to understand what is the 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:48.399
 great goal 

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:51.619
 of the American Cup the great goal of the American Cup is a means 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:56.790
 to to prepare for the eliminator logically we try to 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.930
 of winning all the teams that enter the court want to win 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.199
 but it's a half an official tournament 

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.259
 where finally 

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.280
 markarián will be able to line up all together 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.770
 thinking about the great goal that is 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.440
 the classification to the world trade pause and we continue with more tonight 

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.099
 here in match
