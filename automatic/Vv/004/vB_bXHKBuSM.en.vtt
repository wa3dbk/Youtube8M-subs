00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.970
 Let's take a look now at the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.129
 war game that aims to 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.760
 especially teach the puppy love of 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.900
 your Roman accent the exercise takes a 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.329
 old cloth cuts in two and gives a knot in 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.760
 each door does not make the kind a bone is 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.620
 that you have the ability to hold and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.329
 would try to make the dog has a 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.879
 firmer footprint 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.409
 this exercise I actually use the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.629
 toys by the following 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.790
 at the time when I was instructed to release 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.070
 I will offer a second toy and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.769
 so he is the second of the toy 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.420
 probably want to go back and if 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.070
 Then I'll use the command 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.070
 simultaneously with the event 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.280
 many dogs may be needed 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.810
 to play with it on the ground and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 office banking already likes the joke 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.100
 but if the dog did not show 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 interest is kind of a hunt for 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.970
 toy swing it on the floor does the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.189
 toy occurs if needed and can 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.319
 tied a cord at the beginning of the 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.880
 dog chase away from you and 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:34.219
 then bring it on 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.670
 have committed once he dies I 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.490
 Can I play fighting? 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.039
 the good boy boy I start a lot 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
 Slowly this toy forgives this 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.560
 joking and I'm walking so that I 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.869
 keep his bite stretched and he 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.149
 do not fix the bite that he 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:02:00.229
 did now I want is to keep stretched 20 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.859
 I won a boy very well, I made a good 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.859
 second toy 

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:09.860
 isboa boy 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:17.480
 Okay okay so that you feel a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.200
 I use the command to German 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.440
 can use loose out is something that you 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 should use it once he released me 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.040
 I keep the reward of having unleashed is 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.380
 the other boy Brazilian boy 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.380
 well I have done good liked to win 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.099
 the boy if he apologized to drop light 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:53.379
 simultaneously with the moment by the sun 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:54.430
 Doing it again, it's too much. 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.890
 good 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.560
 oh that very well 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.160
 I can and amplify this fight with him 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.040
 huh 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:14.530
 simulating a fight for very little 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.519
 well boy can lose on his ass the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.280
 doors and striking these stimuli 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.680
 contrary is precisely because of power 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.349
 what we talked about every 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.819
 becomes more focused on the bite and less 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:34.470
 what's happening around 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.470
 I will stop winning the handsome boy is
