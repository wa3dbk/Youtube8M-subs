00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.480 
of crazy pinkish salmon color kind of
coral<00:01:41.880> color<00:01:42.290> mixed<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.470> both<00:01:43.799> these<00:01:44.040> blues

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
coral color mixed with both these blues

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
coral color mixed with both these blues
I<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> nice<00:01:45.390> way<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I really think that's a nice way to to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.600 
I really think that's a nice way to to
bridge<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> gap<00:01:46.649> between<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.100> colors<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
bridge the gap between the colors and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.700 
bridge the gap between the colors and
then<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> light<00:01:49.079> midsole<00:01:49.409> off

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
then you have like a light midsole off

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.700 
then you have like a light midsole off
white<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> gum<00:01:51.450> sole<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
white back and then the gum sole just so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
white back and then the gum sole just so
well<00:01:52.890> put<00:01:53.159> together<00:01:53.360> model<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.600> opinion<00:01:54.630> or

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
about this box and I didn't realize

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550 
about this box and I didn't realize
until<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> put<00:02:00.479> both<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> these<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.320> at

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
until I put both of these out here at

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.230 
until I put both of these out here at
the<00:02:01.710> same<00:02:01.890> time<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> guys<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.060> that

the same time just so you guys know that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
the same time just so you guys know that
the<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.290> model<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> shadowmaster

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the the model is a shadowmaster

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.779 
the the model is a shadowmaster
I<00:02:05.820> believe<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> shadow<00:02:07.079> master<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.530> both

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
I believe it's a shadow master on both

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
I believe it's a shadow master on both
Saucony<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> little<00:02:09.060> tricky<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.539> yeah

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
Saucony is a little tricky because yeah

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
Saucony is a little tricky because yeah
they're<00:02:10.890> both<00:02:11.009> shadow<00:02:11.250> masters<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.760> you

they're both shadow masters I know you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
they're both shadow masters I know you
can<00:02:12.030> tell<00:02:12.120> by<00:02:12.270> looking<00:02:12.300> at<00:02:12.629> them<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:12.870> some

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can tell by looking at them but some

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
can tell by looking at them but some
they<00:02:13.650> look<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:14.040> similar<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.550> each<00:02:14.640> other

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
they look really similar to each other

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.450 
they look really similar to each other
and<00:02:14.970> they're<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.450> same<00:02:15.630> shoe<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> G

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and they're not the same shoe like the G

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.660 
and they're not the same shoe like the G
the<00:02:18.210> G<00:02:18.240> nines<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:18.840> whatever<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> little

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the G nines or whatever is a little

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
the G nines or whatever is a little
different<00:02:20.670> than<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.540> ones

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
different than some of the other ones

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.270 
different than some of the other ones
that<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.900> thought<00:02:22.080> nothing<00:02:22.590> word<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.070> anyway

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that I thought nothing word but anyway

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.260 
that I thought nothing word but anyway
what<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.850> love<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.450> box<00:02:25.160> has<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.730> logo

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
what I love is this box has the the logo

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.000 
what I love is this box has the the logo
and<00:02:27.450> then<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.630> says<00:02:27.810> Saucony<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.320> there<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and then it says Saucony on there and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.130 
and then it says Saucony on there and
then<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.180> by<00:02:30.660> looking<00:02:30.960> at<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
then you can see now by looking at the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.510 
then you can see now by looking at the
box<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.680> looking<00:02:31.920> at<00:02:32.040> both<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
box and then looking at both of the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.120 
box and then looking at both of the
shoes<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.510> box<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.050> actually<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.890> combination

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
shoes the box is actually a combination

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.240 
shoes the box is actually a combination
of<00:02:35.580> both<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.330> pairs<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.830> didn't

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
of both of the pairs so if you didn't

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.310 
of both of the pairs so if you didn't
see<00:02:38.430> both<00:02:38.640> pairs<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> pack<00:02:39.390> when<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.080> box

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
see both pairs of the pack when this box

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.440 
see both pairs of the pack when this box
came<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.190> saw<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.580> half<00:02:41.820> then

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
came out and you just saw this half then

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.510 
came out and you just saw this half then
you<00:02:42.600> could<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.860> didn't<00:02:44.130> know<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.430> we

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
you could like we didn't know but we

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.890 
you could like we didn't know but we
could<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.730> known<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.540> second

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
could have known that the the second

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.470 
could have known that the the second
release<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.190> blue

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
release was going to be the blue

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.940 
release was going to be the blue
variation<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.990> thought<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.620> was<00:02:49.740> just

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
variation so I thought that was just

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.670 
variation so I thought that was just
wicked<00:02:50.130> also<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.120> looks<00:02:51.390> like<00:02:51.600> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.170> look<00:02:52.530> at

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
wicked also it looks like if you look at

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.060 
wicked also it looks like if you look at
it<00:02:52.800> from<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.880> bottom<00:02:54.240> up<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.710> this<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:55.950> just

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
it from the bottom up and this is just

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.860 
it from the bottom up and this is just
all<00:02:56.160> clever<00:02:56.490> stuff<00:02:57.090> man<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.480> looks<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
all clever stuff man it looks like a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.000 
all clever stuff man it looks like a
sunset<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:59.370> ocean<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.420> sky<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
sunset so the ocean the sky and then the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
sunset so the ocean the sky and then the
the<00:03:02.460> sunset<00:03:02.940> coming<00:03:03.270> from<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> sky<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.320> just

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the sunset coming from the sky I just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.470 
the sunset coming from the sky I just
thought<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.770> was<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.280> clever<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.360> way

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
thought that was so clever that the way

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.630 
thought that was so clever that the way
they<00:03:06.630> put<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.900> together<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.550> of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
they put that together and it's one of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.150 
they put that together and it's one of
those<00:03:08.700> things<00:03:08.970> where<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.690> subtle

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
those things where it's a subtle

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
those things where it's a subtle
artistic<00:03:11.160> thing<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.910> they<00:03:12.030> added<00:03:12.210> that<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
artistic thing that they added that I

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.570 
artistic thing that they added that I
didn't<00:03:13.500> even<00:03:13.620> notice<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.010> until<00:03:14.130> I'm<00:03:14.340> looking

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
didn't even notice it until I'm looking

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
didn't even notice it until I'm looking
at<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.970> guys<00:03:15.150> now<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.900> really

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
clever packing and the execution on the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.910 
clever packing and the execution on the
box<00:03:27.120> was<00:03:27.300> great<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.200> execution<00:03:28.740> of<00:03:28.800> the
