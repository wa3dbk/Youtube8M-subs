00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.340
Slowly they vanished,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.160
Both my visible world, and the names of those vibrant blossoms

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.680
Their petals dance and their colors soar in the sky

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
We both raised our glances

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.320
And without a word, simply stared..

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.460
It is for me a vague, enchanting memory…

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.140
This scene of such a vibrant, unnatural blossoming

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
In a shower of countless richly colored blossoms
This scene of such a vibrant, unnatural blossoming

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.980
This scene of such a vibrant, unnatural blossoming

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.300
The dazzling fragrances, the language of flowers
This scene of such a vibrant, unnatural blossoming

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.200
The dazzling fragrances, the language of flowers

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.760
Even now, I simply cannot forget

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.880
Like stars took over the sky
Even now, I simply cannot forget

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.560
Even now, I simply cannot forget

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.380
Flickering in the light
Even now, I simply cannot forget

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.640
Flickering in the light

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.480
Slowly they were dyed

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.960
The earth and the carpeting flowers’ names

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.920
Swaying in the wind, the colors dance and sing

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.180
Alone I stared,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.240
Without a word, and simply stood..

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.540
It was for me a vague, and enchanting scene…

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.600
These flowers blossom out towards the sky
It was for me a vague, and enchanting scene…

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.100
These flowers blossom out towards the sky

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.280
In a shower of countless singly colored blossoms
These flowers blossom out towards the sky

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.880
These flowers blossom out towards the sky

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.760
The dazzling thousand fragrances, that language of flowers
These flowers blossom out towards the sky

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.220
The dazzling thousand fragrances, that language of flowers

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.760
And saw you there that day

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
Washed down over me alone
And saw you there that day

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.580
And saw you there that day

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.380
Sparkling in the light
And saw you there that day

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.940
Sparkling in the light

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.700
Eternally blossoming, that distant day’s scene

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.640
Races through my mind, and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.880
That reminiscent sky, by just standing here

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.880
I now see again

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.880
In my shaking hand it blossomed

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.680
You left me a single flower, and
In my shaking hand it blossomed

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.580
In my shaking hand it blossomed

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.560
As a cold droplet washed over, crying
In my shaking hand it blossomed

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.040
As a cold droplet washed over, crying

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.480
In that single grip was your shadow..

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.300
This sunflower, withered and bent
In that single grip was your shadow..

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.180
In that single grip was your shadow..

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.980
Dropped a seed
In that single grip was your shadow..

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.000
Dropped a seed

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.340
O flower, blossom forever defying

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.480
In a shower of countless richly colored blossoms
O flower, blossom forever defying

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.200
O flower, blossom forever defying

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.040
The dazzling fragrances, the language of flowers
O flower, blossom forever defying

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.480
The dazzling fragrances, the language of flowers

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.020
Towards the sky of that distant day

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.900
Like stars took over the sky
Towards the sky of that distant day

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.800
Towards the sky of that distant day

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.720
Flickering in the light
Towards the sky of that distant day

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.100
Flickering in the light

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.640
Like these seasons ever repeating

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.640
In a shower of countless singly colored blossoms
Like these seasons ever repeating

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.500
Like these seasons ever repeating

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.300
The dazzling thousand fragrances, that language of flowers
Like these seasons ever repeating

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.760
The dazzling thousand fragrances, that language of flowers

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.320
Coming and going, you were there..

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.440
Washed down over me alone
Coming and going, you were there..

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.060
Coming and going, you were there..

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.940
Sparkling in the light
Coming and going, you were there..

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.780
Sparkling in the light
