00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.620
 peaches very good to all and welcome 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.910
 to a video of rigor legend this does not 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.040
 no game if you are not going to teach them 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.260
 a little 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.519
 let's say it's not a little bit, it's not something 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.230
 that have taken into consideration those of 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.630
 river when making changes in the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.810
 jungle and is that the dragon can be done 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.669
 with pantheon from level 1 this is 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.460
 because the speed of down speed 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.529
 so that the dragon and there if we have in 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.539
 account that the passive of pantheons the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.940
 lock you have when every time 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.890
 you make four hits 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.880
 what does it mean that you can download the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.520
 shield before it hits you the same 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.980
 dragon the dragon itself then to 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.380
 it is recorded from here a small video 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.510
 so you can see it as you can 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.860
 check started with w you know the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.650
 machete go to your potions we need 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.440
 more we start with the w so that we 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.780
 allows to recharge the shield when a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.820
 Once we have used it as you see 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.080
 now I just spent is discount 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.370
 he has not even hit me so 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.670
 let's say some hit and such but 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.430
 good using potions and sticking 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 we just got it as you see 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 the shield I'm following, recharging 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.930
 whenever I can interest once it has 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.930
 spent and as long as they have the vee of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.340
 recharging giving the w justly 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.869
 after spending the shield because yes no 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.719
 let's say that we would be that shield 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.429
 losing of the w 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.359
 life is that it is not even me 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:30.890
 going down practically I have full now 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.110
 yes I receive blows and viola no but there 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 is and right now I just spent w 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.579
 just after spending the first shield 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.700
 of the basics I have blocked 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.649
 we keep going up life 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.969
 we are going to suffer a little bit with the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.250
 last blows but it's not going to 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.920
 keep giving practically more because 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 we are blocking what everything is giving us 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 one from time to time will explain to us 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.430
 15 seconds more and it gives us a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.130
 as you can see 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.230
 we have dragon you can do it from the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.510
 level 1 and in a pretty way 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.940
 pretty simple be 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.460
 is something that will surely change those of 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.270
 river all this they will achieve from the side 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 in some way so that it does not happen but 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 of while you can do a lot in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.360
 realize that this can be known to the people 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.750
 of the opposing team and therefore 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 can come to remove it or go to come 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.320
 kill rather can do it they are not going to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.270
 to do but yes to killed then 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.270
 recommended putting the guard on the ratchet 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.160
 for the devout part that comes to him 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.599
 especially the voice ones because normally 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 it's quite controlled but the 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.350
 devoted guys by emery all over the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.990
 support 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.270
 do a check on dragon and 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.300
 I hate life so good, I hope that 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.220
 It serves you to put it into practice if 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.020
 you see it appropriate and nothing else we see 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.260
 in a next video until next time 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.260
 bye
