00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.129
 the movement of the streets provoked a reaction 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.719
 to my positive judgment in the powers 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:18.230
 elected not only the president was 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:21.200
 the congress in the direction of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.390
 make a popular consultation and between 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.080
 referendum, the plebiscite is frankly 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.650
 favor of the plebiscite that the plebiscite is 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.060
 a more direct more direct way in which 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.360
 the opinion of the people will have more weight 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.730
 then we'll see if the issues were 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.770
 properly formulated this we have 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.050
 which also have to discuss the issues 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.690
 be placed very clearly and has 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.410
 which focuses on the problems that have 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.700
 raised in demonstrations 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.030
 here we see is like telling a friend of mine who 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.270
 have a bottle to change, other than the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 ps people are small indeed who 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:12.259
 manifested and were the pioneers of this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.139
 rebellion that to a good extent democratic 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.130
 not at all but in good measure 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:22.249
 16 pioneers have raised the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.749
 problems and I have public power 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:28.219
 obligation to respond I think it is 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.139
 It is very important to strengthen the 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.439
 Brazilian democracy will still have people 

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:37.340
 What's going to happen to ask for a dictatorship? 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.179
 military is not an end to the sting 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.130
 the end of the world but he has no 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.609
 which was what neither what 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.340
 produced negative results for the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.649
 country, especially from the point of view of 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.929
 training of people 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.009
 but I think it is this movement is very 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:00.229
 positive and the plebiscite will power is 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.919
 responding more appropriately gives a 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.170
 clearer definition than the people of the 

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.069
 people want 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.830
 the people want better public services 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 private services also better 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.660
 the people want to be treated is so 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.510
 decent not only the public departments 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.330
 but also how you call a service provider 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.420
 of service that treats poorly 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.220
 then we want more democracy and 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.459
 respect for the rights that have been 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.780
 acquired over time and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:44.830
 consecrated in the constitution of 88 is this 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.090
 what the people want is very good, it's very 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.090
 positive and would charge
