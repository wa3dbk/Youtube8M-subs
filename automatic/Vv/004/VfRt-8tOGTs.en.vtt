00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
in to the right side on the inside so I

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.740 
in to the right side on the inside so I
had<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.500> let<00:01:59.650> him<00:01:59.830> pass<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.300> ran

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
had to let him pass and in that I ran

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
stayed on to the outside of him but I

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.700
