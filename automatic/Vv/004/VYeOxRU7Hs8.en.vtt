resource at chess world has been there
for<00:00:05.250> quite<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.700> few<00:00:05.790> years<00:00:05.970> it's<00:00:06.870> on<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
for quite a few years it's on the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.709 
for quite a few years it's on the
improved<00:00:07.500> menu<00:00:07.919> play<00:00:08.700> like<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> Masters<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
improved menu play like the Masters and

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.390 
improved menu play like the Masters and
recently<00:00:12.719> I've<00:00:12.840> changed<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.160> you've<00:00:14.370> got

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
recently I've changed it so you've got

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
recently I've changed it so you've got
the<00:00:14.759> major<00:00:14.969> expired<00:00:15.450> quick<00:00:15.780> picks<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.350> which

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the major expired quick picks here which

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.340 
the major expired quick picks here which
are<00:00:17.100> quite<00:00:17.190> short<00:00:17.699> decisive<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:19.109> both

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
are quite short decisive because both

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.900 
are quite short decisive because both
games<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.449> use<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.580> click<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
games so we can use this to click the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.410 
games so we can use this to click the
game<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:26.340> list<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> ones<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
game and that list is ones which you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.349 
game and that list is ones which you
haven't<00:00:27.570> done<00:00:28.260> before<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> explore

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
haven't done before so this is explore

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780 
haven't done before so this is explore
against<00:00:30.660> sender<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.980> actually<00:00:32.160> video

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
against sender which was actually video

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.510 
against sender which was actually video
annotated<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.870> channel<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
annotated on this channel I think this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.069 
annotated on this channel I think this
year<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:39.020> try<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
year and so what you do you can try it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170 
year and so what you do you can try it
and<00:00:40.290> play<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> move<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> correct<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and play a move and if it's correct it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.810 
and play a move and if it's correct it
will<00:00:42.329> show<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:43.829> response<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.399> you're<00:00:44.579> like

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
will show the response so you're like

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
will show the response so you're like
playing<00:00:45.289> like<00:00:46.289> Cosmo<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.160> trying<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> emulate

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
playing like Cosmo for trying to emulate

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.119 
playing like Cosmo for trying to emulate
sparf<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:49.020> familiar<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.710> game<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
sparf and I'm familiar with this game so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.630 
sparf and I'm familiar with this game so
I've<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.460> advantage<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> course<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
I've got an advantage here of course I

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.990 
I've got an advantage here of course I
shouldn't<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:53.789> many<00:00:54.180> wrong<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.610> think

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
shouldn't get too many wrong so I think

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
shouldn't get too many wrong so I think
this<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> quick<00:00:58.129> 'if<00:00:59.129> I've

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this was the one with a quick 'if I've

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
this was the one with a quick 'if I've
break<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.960> hear<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
break I think it was actually hear that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.690 
break I think it was actually hear that
black<00:01:02.480> allowed<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.660> ePHI<00:01:04.140> break<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> here

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
black allowed this ePHI break and here

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
black allowed this ePHI break and here
there's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.420> move<00:01:06.659> e<00:01:06.900> 6<00:01:08.299> i'm<00:01:09.299> taking<00:01:09.810> here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
attacks the rook quite forcing game

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.810 
attacks the rook quite forcing game
really<00:01:27.650> nothing<00:01:28.650> he<00:01:28.740> played<00:01:28.920> f4<00:01:29.340> embarrassing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
really nothing he played f4 embarrassing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.990 
really nothing he played f4 embarrassing
the<00:01:29.909> night<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> black<00:01:32.189> had<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.610> resourceful

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the night so black had to be resourceful

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
the night so black had to be resourceful
here<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> check<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.110> Bishop<00:01:34.740> b6<00:01:35.100> who

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
here with this check for Bishop b6 who

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
here with this check for Bishop b6 who
run<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> video<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> happened<00:01:38.750> but

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
run from the video so this happened but

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
run from the video so this happened but
now<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.079> sparf<00:01:40.619> still<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.310> advantage

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
now I think sparf still had an advantage

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.139 
now I think sparf still had an advantage
here<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.979> did<00:01:43.979> he<00:01:44.009> take<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> f7<00:01:45.149> no<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:47.000> think<00:01:48.000> he

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
here and did he take on f7 no I think he

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.719 
here and did he take on f7 no I think he
might<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.360> played<00:01:49.909> f5<00:01:52.100> okay<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.280> taking

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
might have played f5 okay then taking

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.800 
might have played f5 okay then taking
here<00:01:54.030> hope

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
here hope

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.109 
here hope
and<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.380> kept<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.950> resource<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.610> e-cigs

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
and I kept that resource that e-cigs

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.330 
and I kept that resource that e-cigs
attacking<00:01:59.659> resource<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.259> Issei<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:00.950> he<00:02:01.189> just

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
attacking resource on Issei so he just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.080 
attacking resource on Issei so he just
took<00:02:01.520> hair<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.409> this<00:02:03.409> f8<00:02:03.890> was<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.100> troublesome

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
took hair and this f8 was a troublesome

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.930 
took hair and this f8 was a troublesome
Bishop<00:02:05.780> g5<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.619> position<00:02:07.009> embarasses<00:02:08.050> e7

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
Bishop g5 in this position embarasses e7

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.729 
Bishop g5 in this position embarasses e7
but<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.060> wasn't<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.360> move<00:02:12.610> no<00:02:13.610> actually

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
but that wasn't the move no actually

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.070 
but that wasn't the move no actually
maybe<00:02:15.739> just<00:02:15.860> Bishop<00:02:16.310> h6<00:02:16.849> because<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.840> knew

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
maybe just Bishop h6 because then I knew

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.229 
maybe just Bishop h6 because then I knew
the<00:02:18.200> rooks<00:02:18.410> holding<00:02:18.800> f8<00:02:19.360> was<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:22.239> yeah

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
the rooks holding f8 was that it yeah

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.460 
the rooks holding f8 was that it yeah
black<00:02:23.510> tried<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:23.989> something<00:02:24.019> about<00:02:24.290> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
black tried to do something about it

any<00:03:01.870> thing<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.049> see<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.739> where<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.100> was

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
any thing to see you know where it was

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.849 
any thing to see you know where it was
where<00:03:04.579> you<00:03:04.670> went<00:03:04.730> wrong<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.380> here<00:03:06.620> what<00:03:06.709> went

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
where you went wrong so here what went

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.130 
where you went wrong so here what went
wrong<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.730> idea<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.060> weaken<00:03:08.450> c7<00:03:08.989> not

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
wrong with the idea to weaken c7 not

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.069 
wrong with the idea to weaken c7 not
night<00:03:09.410> tags<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.859> think<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.130> would<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:11.079> allow

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
night tags I think that would just allow

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:18.280 
night tags I think that would just allow
Queen<00:03:12.799> tanks<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.519> something<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> here<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
Queen tanks or something so here the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.890 
Queen tanks or something so here the
crap<00:03:18.500> move<00:03:18.650> was<00:03:18.829> Queen<00:03:19.100> takes<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.880> yeah<00:03:23.690> it's

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
crap move was Queen takes so yeah it's

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.319 
crap move was Queen takes so yeah it's
quite<00:03:24.079> an<00:03:24.290> interesting<00:03:24.620> resource<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.579> if<00:03:25.700> so

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
quite an interesting resource and if so

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.849 
quite an interesting resource and if so
we've<00:03:26.510> done<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.900> game<00:03:27.139> if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.410> want<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> see

let<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.579> try<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.150> few<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.569> these<00:03:50.840> on<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
let you try a few of these on a

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.500 
let you try a few of these on a
particular<00:03:51.560> day<00:03:51.980> even<00:03:52.370> as<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.730> guess<00:03:53.060> then<00:03:53.269> I'm

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
particular day even as I guess then I'm

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.990 
particular day even as I guess then I'm
going<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.660> raise<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.049> limit<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:56.530> say<00:03:57.670> five<00:03:58.670> a

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
