00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello good game, we do not have a comment on the second 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.639
 like a brain 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 next to starcraft livezerg he 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 jondrette will eat teams run 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 hi well you already free so happened 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 that you didn't get to play 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.500
 Well, it's okay, but 1 16 starts but 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.609
 scene one eighth 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
 I will give it but tell us what went wrong 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.920
 So 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.590
 what were difficult hands for a match 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.809
 everyone seemed to ask easy and matches 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 Were with Russian players traditionally 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.149
 the fact that in Russia only a few players 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 playing well with the koreans was hard and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.539
 from 2 weeks and the last did not train 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 I almost had eye problems 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.500
 some I can not sit long for 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 computer, I thought that well, not at all 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 ready like their first games especially 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 I myself am wildly kosyachil there I have not 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.700
 some units have been ordered 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.040
 the blocks were constant 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.150
 here to the second group I have a little 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.010
 grew up playing so zerg embellishment races 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.410
 korean up balcony 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 I won one card from him but others 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.730
 games were equal approximate me were there 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 chances but there typical kasib jambs 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.020
 Europeans like Russian and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 led to defeat was further five 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.760
 Russian player is not very strong 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.930
 then there was a Korean protos I already 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.290
 tired in the evening 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.580
 and I caught a cold the plane was hard for me 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.640
 I decided to play 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.830
 invent all sorts of cool watches and I 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.370
 the first through which played 1313 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.410
 story13 u calculated I calculated for that 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.190
 that he will be the first nexus but he managed 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.570
 to scout and so but he wanted 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.150
 put in the end nexus but set 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.710
 a very late battle and in the end I played with 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.940
 advantage and for the fact that he was lagging behind and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.120
 on technology yet but mickey 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.950
 So I got to fool him and he 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.229
 I thought that I would play Mutu I put 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.900
 spire and fourth base but I wanted to play 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 Mutu and I instead made the orcish 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.640
 links max soaked bering real and hall 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.170
 and him just and there the phoenix flew out 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.260
 the end as if there is no pool 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.150
 outwitted and in the second game he is very 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.959
 glad twisted due to the fact that he was afraid again 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.690
 the same watch on the shore I played round 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.239
 in the floor 2 you and he did not see gas stopper 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.160
 but I saw the third base and in the end I decided 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.709
 18 to fly pro progushit 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.390
 dogs and very succeeded in 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.720
 it all got off very strongly and ultimately 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.450
 I was just there to have brought to the reel pine 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.360
 there is not particularly expected that the snow 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 plays a lot now but because 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.569
 I managed to win his first 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.180
 game in the second 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.519
 that act and well I came as if with 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.250
 so nihilists personal relationships then 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.690
 I thought I would lose is not scary but wait as 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.200
 i won the first game i started something 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.290
 be nervous 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.920
 it happens to me I don't know how with this 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.459
 fight 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.090
 in the second game I will have him I wanted him 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.040
 clean 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.959
 but he did later through in the end 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.209
 he has the best economy and no matter how 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.710
 lucky with all of 3 I already quite that you 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:15.120
 decapitated and make a complete nonsense 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:19.380
 these are both groups so nervous 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.970
 Well, it is okay, but the trip is like for the first time in 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.420
 Russia we all ask 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.430
 what does it mean for you and is it good 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.400
 is it bad that he is the first last 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.990
 considering the mood of the door anyway 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.390
 this is just like you think about 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.820
 already ending in principle and how 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.740
 organization there organization as usual 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.720
 In the north of the Bahamas, everything is even a computer and 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.750
 brought in which they usually for 3 taki 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.880
 carry all the same almost judges well here 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.390
 a bit of luxury on washing that same 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.390
 in essence 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 nice hair to come because all 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.610
 old players came even those who are not 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.550
 plays almost chat well do you think 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.120
 that how to trim somehow help to rise 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.880
 stark taste from knees in russia in russia 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.670
 let's high 8 ha take know hardly 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.590
 dota too much affects the mind 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.050
 people 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.340
 Russia but in the world like not all so button 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.290
 or yes okay the players are good just in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.729
 Russia for some reason it happened that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.769
 only happy can well more or less 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.840
 Stable to play but it's like 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.470
 not strong enough to be in the top 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.729
 Europe, even because there is no leader 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.770
 as if there is no audience but what can 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.880
 do not to sweat popularity 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.590
 starkov then in cis 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.830
 there should be a leader a player of some kind 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.650
 who won and no wins 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.720
 Nobody wants to watch the audience 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.030
 for example, but the house will not help another 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.520
 which is here in 2015 he can help 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.760
 some player something to understand something 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.830
 change and start winning well without winning 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.010
 okay then tell us about 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.039
 gps there now is some kind of system with 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.070
 visas with it all and say more 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.460
 Koreans will come though they expected it to be 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.740
 less what heard it what they want 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.590
 to block 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.830
 slots up region zavolokin so you can not 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.139
 was playing online for any region 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.479
 but many Koreans followed watered out 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.969
 their plays by teams and they want to take 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.450
 it seems to me to live here in Europe 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.740
 I do not know where this will lead 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.630
 should i think koreans need 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.270
 completely drive a few no passport 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.120
 from Europe how would you please from here but 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.420
 there has been a string of 1 or more against both 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.750
 no points at zero. then every season 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.100
 goes but there will be zeroing slots like 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.080
 no one would be no prime 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.540
 leagues not chellendzha all re-selection 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.700
 that is, if these Koreans arrive 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.460
 sketch on them will have to beat too 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.200
 dofiga players can not get well 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.210
 okay, let's talk about something else 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.060
 for example you are the horse of sorrows you are back in 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.610
