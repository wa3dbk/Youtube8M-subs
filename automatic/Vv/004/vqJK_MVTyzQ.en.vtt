like okay so come on over here throw it
almost<00:04:41.620> up<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:46.450> can't<00:04:46.660> just<00:04:46.720> dump<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.290> right

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
almost up you can't just dump it right

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.920 
almost up you can't just dump it right
in<00:04:47.550> just<00:04:48.550> run<00:04:48.760> around<00:04:48.910> make<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.419> even<00:04:49.570> nice

in just run around make it even nice
around<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.770> normal<00:04:50.950> pancake<00:04:51.900> don't<00:04:52.900> treat

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
around like normal pancake don't treat

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.820 
around like normal pancake don't treat
you<00:04:53.169> any<00:04:53.200> differently

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.920 

all<00:04:58.830> right<00:04:58.949> now<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.910> made<00:05:00.150> regular<00:05:00.360> pancakes

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
all right now you made regular pancakes

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.200 
all right now you made regular pancakes
before<00:05:01.050> one<00:05:01.860> difference<00:05:02.280> with<00:05:02.430> this<00:05:02.639> compared

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
before one difference with this compared

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.010 
before one difference with this compared
to<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.720> regular<00:05:04.350> pancake<00:05:04.710> batter<00:05:06.020> usually

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
to that regular pancake batter usually

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.689 
to that regular pancake batter usually
after<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.500> couple<00:05:07.680> minutes<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.160> batter<00:05:08.400> will

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
after a couple minutes the batter will

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.100 
after a couple minutes the batter will
bow<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.270> that's<00:05:09.510> when<00:05:09.660> it's<00:05:09.750> ready<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.990> flip

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
bow and that's when it's ready to flip

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.610 
bow and that's when it's ready to flip
this<00:05:10.590> one<00:05:10.650> bubble<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:12.210> when<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.020> edges<00:05:13.440> start

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
this one bubble so when the edges start

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.490 
this one bubble so when the edges start
getting<00:05:14.040> brown<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:15.110> usually<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.169> after<00:05:16.470> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
getting brown and usually just after a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.020 
getting brown and usually just after a
couple<00:05:16.680> minutes<00:05:16.860> it's<00:05:17.100> ready<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.580> cooks

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
couple minutes it's ready that cooks

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.310 
couple minutes it's ready that cooks
quicker<00:05:18.270> because<00:05:18.449> it<00:05:18.660> absorbs<00:05:18.810> everything

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
quicker because it absorbs everything

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.850 
quicker because it absorbs everything
more<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:20.010> dries<00:05:20.610> out<00:05:20.850> quicker<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.960> just<00:05:22.470> pay

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
more it dries out quicker so just pay

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.350 
more it dries out quicker so just pay
attention<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.490> this<00:05:23.639> don't<00:05:23.910> walk<00:05:24.090> away<00:05:24.240> from

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
attention to this don't walk away from

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.300 
attention to this don't walk away from
it<00:05:24.690> as<00:05:24.870> soon<00:05:25.050> as<00:05:25.110> right<00:05:25.350> flip<00:05:25.590> flip<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.010> let<00:05:26.280> it

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
it as soon as right flip flip it let it

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.520 
it as soon as right flip flip it let it
go<00:05:26.550> we'll<00:05:27.030> say<00:05:27.210> maybe<00:05:27.479> another<00:05:27.750> minute<00:05:28.199> or<00:05:28.229> so

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
go we'll say maybe another minute or so

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.110 
go we'll say maybe another minute or so
and<00:05:28.800> then<00:05:28.860> it's<00:05:29.340> done<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.729> don't<00:05:29.940> want<00:05:30.060> to

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
and then it's done you don't want to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.909 
and then it's done you don't want to
overcook<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.539> because<00:05:31.020> then<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.470> dries<00:05:31.680> out

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
overcook it because then it dries out

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.740 
overcook it because then it dries out
too<00:05:32.160> much<00:05:32.340> still<00:05:32.699> be<00:05:32.820> good<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.449> dries<00:05:33.630> out

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
too much still be good but it dries out

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.090 
too much still be good but it dries out
too<00:05:33.960> much<00:05:34.110> I'm<00:05:34.410> going<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.650> eat<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.830> press<00:05:34.949> the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
too much I'm going to eat the press the

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.900 
too much I'm going to eat the press the
better<00:05:35.810> because<00:05:36.810> before<00:05:37.530> we<00:05:37.710> go<00:05:37.889> I've<00:05:38.490> done

cook this with without the baking powder
it<00:06:22.440> definitely<00:06:22.889> won't<00:06:23.130> get<00:06:23.340> us<00:06:23.430> fluffy<00:06:23.789> but

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
it definitely won't get us fluffy but

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000 
it definitely won't get us fluffy but
say<00:06:24.180> kind<00:06:24.419> of<00:06:24.510> flat<00:06:24.810> I'm<00:06:25.410> like<00:06:25.620> you<00:06:25.740> know<00:06:25.770> very

say kind of flat I'm like you know very
good<00:06:26.160> pancake<00:06:26.460> batter<00:06:26.580> kind<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:26.940> rises<00:06:27.120> up<00:06:27.270> so

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
good pancake batter kind of rises up so

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.870 
good pancake batter kind of rises up so
this<00:06:28.560> would<00:06:28.770> rise<00:06:28.979> up<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.250> little<00:06:29.430> bit<00:06:29.550> makes<00:06:29.820> a

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
this would rise up a little bit makes a

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.730 
this would rise up a little bit makes a
little<00:06:30.090> bit<00:06:30.180> fluffier<00:06:30.570> like<00:06:31.440> I<00:06:31.470> said<00:06:31.590> just

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740
