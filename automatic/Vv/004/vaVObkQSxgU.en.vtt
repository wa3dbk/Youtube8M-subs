should<00:03:08.049> have<00:03:08.170> been<00:03:08.290> exposed<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.980> bit<00:03:09.130> more<00:03:09.370> but

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
should have been exposed a bit more but

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.849 
should have been exposed a bit more but
honestly<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.660> cannot<00:03:10.870> really<00:03:11.109> feel<00:03:11.500> which

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
honestly I cannot really feel which

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.160

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
button I have my finger on the right now

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.680

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
so that's something that LG should have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.089 
so that's something that LG should have
improved<00:03:17.560> upon

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
improved upon

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.979
