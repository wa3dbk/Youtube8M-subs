00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
back and figure out what that one it's
basically<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> pair<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> jeans<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.229> they

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
basically like a pair of jeans but they

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
basically like a pair of jeans but they
come<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:04.829> lower<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.360> have

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
come down lower on your way so they have

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.820 
come down lower on your way so they have
a<00:02:06.600> wide<00:02:06.750> waistband<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> come<00:02:07.560> down

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
a wide waistband to come down

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.550 
a wide waistband to come down
on<00:02:08.190> your<00:02:08.369> waist<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.540> do<00:02:09.720> sure<00:02:09.960> pick<00:02:10.170> designs

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
on your waist I can do sure pick designs

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.170 
on your waist I can do sure pick designs
and<00:02:10.860> I'll<00:02:10.950> probably<00:02:11.250> end<00:02:11.490> up<00:02:11.640> having<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.000> do

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and I'll probably end up having to do

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
and I'll probably end up having to do
anyway<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.630> reason<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.440> thought<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
anyway but for some reason I thought you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.210 
anyway but for some reason I thought you
know<00:02:17.820> maybe<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.150> shape<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> leg<00:02:18.920> would<00:02:19.920> be

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
know maybe the shape of the leg would be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.040 
know maybe the shape of the leg would be
better<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.880> could<00:02:21.030> draw<00:02:21.210> with<00:02:21.240> turf<00:02:21.870> it

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
better and I could draw with turf it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930 
better and I could draw with turf it
designs<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.860> looks<00:02:23.070> like<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> fits<00:02:23.640> tight

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
designs it looks like it fits tight

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.730 
designs it looks like it fits tight
around<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.420> bottom<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.780> her<00:02:24.930> calf<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.440> want

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
around the bottom of her calf and I want

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.600 
around the bottom of her calf and I want
that<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:27.060> anyway<00:02:27.840> we'll<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.250> wanted<00:02:29.550> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that so anyway we'll see but I wanted to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.880 
that so anyway we'll see but I wanted to
show<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.850> something<00:02:30.150> yes<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.780> made<00:02:31.680> this

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
show you something yes I made this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.970 
show you something yes I made this
jacket<00:02:32.490> oh<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.450> wasn't<00:02:33.750> Christmas<00:02:34.230> time<00:02:34.740> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
jacket oh it wasn't Christmas time I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.270 
jacket oh it wasn't Christmas time I
guess<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> simplicity<00:02:37.710> pattern

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
guess I think it's a simplicity pattern

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.220 
guess I think it's a simplicity pattern
and<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.760> remember<00:02:39.030> telling<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.810> that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and I remember telling you about it that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.900 
and I remember telling you about it that
it<00:02:40.320> has<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> ruffle<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.190> all<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.670> way<00:02:41.700> around

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
it has a ruffle going all the way around

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.940 
it has a ruffle going all the way around
up<00:02:42.390> around<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> neck<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.290> back<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> front

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
up around the neck and back on the front

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.140 
up around the neck and back on the front
well<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.680> had<00:02:46.680> issues<00:02:47.310> with<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.550> ruffle

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
well I had issues with that ruffle

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.750 
well I had issues with that ruffle
number<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.590> too<00:02:49.830> wide<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.610> looks

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
number one it was too wide and it looks

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.220 
number one it was too wide and it looks
like<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.000> was<00:02:51.150> growing<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.660> my<00:02:51.840> throat<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
like it was growing up my throat and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.020 
like it was growing up my throat and
gonna<00:02:52.380> strangle<00:02:52.709> me<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.250> cut<00:02:53.550> part<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
gonna strangle me so I cut part of it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.880 
gonna strangle me so I cut part of it
off<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.600> then<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.230> couldn't<00:02:55.440> figure<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
off and then I couldn't figure out the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.280 
off and then I couldn't figure out the
directions<00:02:56.580> on<00:02:56.970> how<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.510> put<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> ruffle<00:02:58.140> on

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
directions on how to put the ruffle on

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.680 
directions on how to put the ruffle on
and<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.070> finally<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.610> figured<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.300> out<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and so finally I figured that out and I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.230 
and so finally I figured that out and I
got<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.410> then<00:03:02.100> Billy<00:03:02.400> came<00:03:02.700> over<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
got it on and then Billy came over and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.840 
got it on and then Billy came over and
helped<00:03:03.540> me<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.650> told<00:03:05.310> me<00:03:05.400> what<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> do

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
helped me with it and told me what to do

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.610 
helped me with it and told me what to do
to<00:03:06.120> make<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.390> look<00:03:06.540> better<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.990> ruffle<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
to make it look better on the ruffle and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.160 
to make it look better on the ruffle and
so<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.860> did<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.630> got<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.959> done

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so I did that and then I got that done

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.110 
so I did that and then I got that done
and<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.440> put<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.250> thought<00:03:11.430> oh<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.970> just

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and I put it on I thought oh this just

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120 
and I put it on I thought oh this just
looks<00:03:12.360> ridiculous<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:13.019> me<00:03:13.170> I'm<00:03:13.440> throwing<00:03:13.920> away

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
looks ridiculous on me I'm throwing away

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.880 
looks ridiculous on me I'm throwing away
