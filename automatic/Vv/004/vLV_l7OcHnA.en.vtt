00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 applecaps by mcdonald's of the here 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.740
 whole ingredients we have a finished one 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.109
 Puff pastry can be common in any 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 purchase supermarket 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.880
 sweetish sourish apples brown sugar 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.980
 butter cinnamon vanilla sugar and I am 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.480
 put a little bit on the apple bag 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 with Italian pine nuts for the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 the apples we need a pot 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 and then later to bake we take 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 The fryer you can but also 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 always take higher pan 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 or a bigger pot and the menus 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 to fill 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.550
 we start with the apples we see 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.550
 I have a peeler here 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.970
 halved the peeled apples and then 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 Let's cut the rest of the Scharnebeck 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 core 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 Halve the length again and 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.030
 then in small pieces or pens 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.510
 so cut if I'm not right 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.910
 Remember at McDonald's they are something 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.140
 smaller so cut into pens 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.710
 So this time as possible first 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.650
 Let's not go into the pot like that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.650
 much from the pieces to 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 about four to five spoonfuls of brown 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.280
 sugar then I still go to him 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.700
 Vanilla sugar is added 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.750
 fine aroma then please more light 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:26.920
 are as a recommendation even after gusto me 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:30.190
 likes the taste of the time very much the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.989
 Whole mass we leave for about six 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.550
 seven minutes in front of him in köthen 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.209
 for the taste a little bit 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.790
 I still give a track to top it off 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:55.480
 nutmeg in addition there is a very 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:58.900
 spicy note the fill masses are about 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.270
 four to five minutes now on the stove 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.610
 we only give Italian now 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.610
 They are very because of me 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.959
 very aromatic but very pleasant 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.420
 taste and I give here now 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.430
 just add a few more 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.000
 You can also use cousins ​​or 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.500
 just like in McDonald's apple pure 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.720
 we are now at about 67 minutes 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.440
 and the mass and the apple is like that now 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.650
 nice snack he should be slightly soft 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.750
 but not too soft 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.420
 I now turn the flame and we 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.670
 leave this mass for about one now 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.519
 Half an hour received and we share 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:51.700
 now in equal pieces to fill 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:55.209
 We fill with the cooled mass 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:02.440
 now one page and this half 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:08.019
 here and then we just beat the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.480
 other half over it lightly press 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.340
 on 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:17.889
 and then we still press with that 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:23.020
 terrain again here at the edge of a 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.330
 Through this we create a toothing and 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.180
 it is super glued so we proceed 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.580
 with the other puff pastry the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.710
 next part after we have in one 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.410
 cut another format we want 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.930
 now more that mcdonald's format so 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.730
 somewhat narrower full length, they rank 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.949
 Okay, but they are easy now 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:52.100
 instead of girlfriend a lot but now five 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:56.700
 pieces cut open 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.639
 Press on the edges and then again 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.220
 with the garde in the press 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.400
 Meanwhile , I have the fryer 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.139
 actually switch and bake now 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.639
 take current bag and how 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:20.750
 Simply place them in the basket to give the 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:24.320
 In between, we control the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.350
 side look at which already a beautiful 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.870
 golden brown color bring shortly to the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.530
 apple bag are now wonderful 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.830
 The planning was now about nine 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.520
 up to ten minutes in hot fat at 180 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.760
 degree we are now again 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.979
 Crepe paper and the apple bag in the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.650
 Dough still a little fat to escape 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.260
 a little bit bigger than mcdonald's 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.450
 what my appetite only benefits and 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.450
 can only say good appetite
