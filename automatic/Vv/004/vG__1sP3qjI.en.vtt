 there are many possibilities and 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.060
 also in the point of saying 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.890
 Configurations look at the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.720
 chat too many possibilities 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.580

 best fits a messenger app 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.100
 one uses already quite often straight 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.989
 if there are many friends and that too 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.910
 Of course, it should be so much too 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.190
 Good and that's just chaton 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.989
 here also another practical 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.790
 Do not necessarily work on everyone 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.320
 Services is the pop up in the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.180

 You just need an e-mail 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.170
 address and password for you can 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.270

 also chat in connection with these 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.830
 use social network and you have 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.060
 then even another function 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.040

 known and kindred people you 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.270
 just by different connections 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.660
 other people happen to be familiar 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.070
 would 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.870
 and so you can also discover people 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.760
 not necessarily in your address book 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.140
 but that just knows you and the 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.940

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.919
 but you also have the possibility the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.990

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.900
 sin euro chat or contacts to add 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.700
 another little add on the chat 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.510
 offers are the interaction 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.400
 awards 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.590
 that means depending on how many 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.289
 people contact you how often you are in 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.300
 japan are active or be interactively 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.770
 better you get awards 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.360
 I think this feature can be possible 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.580
 because you can in principle without 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960
 really something to do here too 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.450
 join in because you do not have to 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.280
 do as to work with chaton too 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.870

 receive 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.300
 yes, all in all, I think so 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.800
 really a very good messaging from it 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.840
 There are many functions integrated 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.700
 just with animated greeting cards, etc 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.710
 many things the other messaging 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.720
 services do not want to provide further 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.940
 I also mention it completely 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.310
 free and there are no consequences 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.510
 cost you to so I can do that 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.280
 really only someone 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.620
 warm there is just about everyone 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.510
 operating systems of smartphones and also 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.980
 just like I said blackberrys and me 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.020
