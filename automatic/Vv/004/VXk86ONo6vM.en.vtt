00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 a person, however, George 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 international team of President of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 syndicate ecolife work at night there are 20 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 I started this business because its 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.320
 products and using correctly 53 done 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.309
 14 pounds alloy thing worked in having 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 a good deal 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.820
 We are going to talk to you today, how is it? 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.680
 that we make the flan of what you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 have heard there are not many ideas 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.080
 where it has to be done and has some 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.199
 details that are important 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.060
 The first thing I know how to do is to get 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.830
 250 ml of hot water it has to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.250
 be very hot 3 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250
 your preference 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.510
 two and a half spoons full of your taste 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.719
 and a measured spoon of protein 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.789
 Okay now you're going to hit the sheik for 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.679
 two minutes or so a few times 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.659
 and bass I know it 's normal I do not go 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.659
 read everyone on the plate engraving 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.670
 Okay, so you put it in your glass and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.850
 You transfer here, here 's a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.850
 bowl with ice from where you have to 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.330
 colter pay attention that the level of 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.220
 full trying to level the water like ice 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.100
 this thermal shock is necessary to 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.140
 that there is the transformation of fla in touch 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.470
 to stay here in the range of 20 to 30 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.280
 minutes and then you cover it and place 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.229
 in the freezer 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 There you leave for two more hours. 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.450
 You put it in the fridge and you 're 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.190
 ready you consult this advantage of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 do the Flemish in the first place you 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 can eat any time in the middle of the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 night and before bed any time 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.320
 What you want was in your refrigerator. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.759
 fruit is then much more practical 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.009
 for you to use the doors at any time 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.720
 of the day and according to the problem that we 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.190
 we have healthy living space 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.750
 we hardly have time to talk 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.090
 with many people is a lot of people within the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.310
 space and you are on duty during the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.930
 and everything is ready at the time of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.430
 people already have the taste that I think 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.950
 take the day before 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 and you stand confrontational then you're more 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.480
 near you talk to people 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.850
 be able to dialogue with them to 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.860
 necessary relationship with our 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 participants touch something else that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.030
 You can also do some 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.190
 cups of this size plus plastic 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 it comes and disposable so you 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.930
 give evidence to people who are still 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.540
 not as it is and not use Plan B was a 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.510
 fan you're in space so he can 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.940
 spoon run like a spoonful touch 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.070
 so she comes in and feels the taste of the flank 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.880
 So I could ask you to 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.250
 following day 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 I think these measures are great is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.200
 Who invented this is to be congratulated. 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.360
 changing completely is the result has 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.030
 people who are serving more than 200 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.850
 200 people living space 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.019
 healthy life of the flu then social 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.019
 you until the next
