have the ones that I'll actually go into

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
have the ones that I'll actually go into
the<00:00:31.410> fork<00:00:31.650> holes<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.160> lift<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.579> really

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the fork holes that will lift it really

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.160 
the fork holes that will lift it really
not<00:00:33.390> stable<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.410> don't<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.770> those<00:00:36.020> this<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
not stable you don't want those this is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.459 
not stable you don't want those this is
pretty<00:00:37.380> much<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.469> you'll

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
pretty much the one you want and you'll

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.900 
pretty much the one you want and you'll
notice<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.129> most<00:00:42.030> bikes<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> actual<00:00:46.430> mount<00:00:47.430> or

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
notice on most bikes the actual mount or

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.930 
notice on most bikes the actual mount or
the<00:00:48.149> caliper<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.770> lower<00:00:49.980> down<00:00:50.309> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the caliper here is a lot lower down so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
the caliper here is a lot lower down so
usually<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.289> actually<00:00:52.469> lean<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.610> up

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
usually this will actually lean right up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
usually this will actually lean right up
against<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> no<00:00:54.899> problems<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> on

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
against it no problems you can get it on

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
against it no problems you can get it on
the<00:00:56.219> front<00:00:56.370> stand<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the front stand but when the with the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.939 
the front stand but when the with the
ninja<00:00:58.379> 250<00:00:58.969> it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.120> small<00:01:00.449> bike<00:01:00.800> these<00:01:01.800> are

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
ninja 250 it's a small bike these are

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
ninja 250 it's a small bike these are
small<00:01:02.280> Forks<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> front<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.930> doesn't

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
small Forks in the front really doesn't

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.340 
small Forks in the front really doesn't
work<00:01:04.559> too<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.479> always

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
work too well this one right here always

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.560 
work too well this one right here always
wants<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> slip<00:01:08.010> under<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> always<00:01:09.150> wants

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
wants to slip under and it always wants

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.219 
wants to slip under and it always wants
to<00:01:09.600> come<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.360> developed<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to come up so I actually developed a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.910 
to come up so I actually developed a
little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.360> mod<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.900> guess<00:01:16.740> I'm

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
little bit of a a mod here I guess I'm

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.300 
little bit of a a mod here I guess I'm
just<00:01:17.070> improvising<00:01:18.470> what<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.680> did<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
just improvising what I actually did the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
just improvising what I actually did the
fix<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> problem<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
fix this problem what you're going to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
fix this problem what you're going to
see<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:24.799> don't<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> can

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
see right now I don't know if you can

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539 
see right now I don't know if you can
see<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.170> cheap<00:01:29.009> screw<00:01:29.310> driver

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
see that we got a cheap screw driver

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
see that we got a cheap screw driver
there<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> cheap<00:01:31.740> screw<00:01:32.040> driver

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there and we got a cheap screw driver

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.749 
there and we got a cheap screw driver
there<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.350> guess<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.829> use<00:01:34.979> my<00:01:35.130> chest<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
there and I guess I use my chest here to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
there and I guess I use my chest here to
push<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.600> kept<00:01:36.810> those

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
push that down as I kept those

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.280 
push that down as I kept those
screwdrivers<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.000> prevented<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.840> from

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
screwdrivers in and prevented that from

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.100 
screwdrivers in and prevented that from
sliding<00:01:40.650> back<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.509> problem

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
sliding back and there you go problem

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.060 
sliding back and there you go problem
solved

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
solved

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.020 
solved
we<00:01:44.280> got<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.759> anyone

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
we got it off and I don't know if anyone

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.550 
we got it off and I don't know if anyone
else<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.360> had<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> issue<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> stand

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
else has had that issue with the stand

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.389 
else has had that issue with the stand
on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> ninja<00:01:50.159> 250<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.890> really<00:01:52.890> didn't

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
on the ninja 250 but I really didn't

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.100 
on the ninja 250 but I really didn't
find<00:01:53.610> too<00:01:53.790> many<00:01:53.880> solutions<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
find too many solutions I know a lot of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
find too many solutions I know a lot of
people<00:01:55.350> came<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.460> alternatives<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
people came up with alternatives and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.260 
people came up with alternatives and
fixing<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.070> but<00:01:59.070> yeah<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.060> did

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
fixing that but yeah that's what I did

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
fixing that but yeah that's what I did
and<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.530> notice<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and also as you notice you got the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.749 
and also as you notice you got the
spring<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> should<00:02:04.759> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
spring here I have it on as I should it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
spring here I have it on as I should it
was<00:02:05.909> actually<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> smallest

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
was actually it's on the smallest

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
was actually it's on the smallest
setting<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.220> wasn't<00:02:08.459> enough<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
setting and it wasn't enough I have to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.219 
setting and it wasn't enough I have to
go<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> little

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
go a little

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
spring tension so this one could

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.040 
spring tension so this one could
