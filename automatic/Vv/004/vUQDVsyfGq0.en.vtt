here here's the reasoning behind it it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.910 
here here's the reasoning behind it it's
uh<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:26.660> comfortable<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.350> wear<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.709> not

uh it's comfortable to wear it's not

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.010 
uh it's comfortable to wear it's not
it's<00:02:28.580> not<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> big<00:02:29.330> nothing<00:02:29.569> better<00:02:29.900> than

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's not like a big nothing better than

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.570 
it's not like a big nothing better than
having<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.260> deadly<00:02:30.590> device<00:02:30.920> strapped<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
having a deadly device strapped in the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.410 
having a deadly device strapped in the
next<00:02:31.790> year<00:02:31.940> no<00:02:32.150> no<00:02:32.390> something<00:02:32.900> you're<00:02:33.470> right

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
next year no no something you're right

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.690 
next year no no something you're right
it<00:02:35.420> gives<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> feeling<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.620> security<00:02:37.280> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it gives you a feeling of security that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.850 
it gives you a feeling of security that
you<00:02:37.850> don't<00:02:38.090> normally<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.959> with<00:02:39.680> the
