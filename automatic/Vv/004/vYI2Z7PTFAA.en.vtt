 I have a curiosity to know is this 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.590
 way 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.040
 in that bag that in the area is the worst thing 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.990
 how is the work done by the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.509
 people how it develops until you get 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.450
 here in this bag in the same 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.840
 the first is that we 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.000
 we took woods that are woods to be 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.870
 chic and expensive then - driving 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.470
 forest 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.110
 We do not work well beaten half to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.780
 concern in the first place with the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.140
 environment as we work for 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.350
 develop the bio-jewels we work 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.500
 the laboratory will develop the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.459
 as an example the collar laws myself am 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.220
 using what's been here a lot at the store 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.830
 it's in the neck then one with work 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.769
 lab together and partner with clean 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.350
 we developed the toxicity of wood 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.940
 then all species of butter 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.090
 set up our new go 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.790
 she exists they have some toxicity 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.380
 can not cause more health problems 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.799
 likes outsourcing 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.209
 in our research on their album 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.489
 massaranduba is a species that she has 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.310
 a toxicity that can lead to a 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.799
 can take you up to and maybe close the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.860
 closing shop and even the motorcycle then 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.989
 we have to pass this city as 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.079
 this product is made so you see 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.140
 that our product it has a protection 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:29.420
 bottle to protect the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:32.720
 try using aa part and it is developed 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.030
 through research that I told you 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.370
 we developed looking for a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.780
 correct alternative and with 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.880
 sustainability 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.520
 rose and suddenly they are watching 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.590
 At home, what do you want to learn? 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.020
 we have a workshop to know this 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.750
 woman to do what she does at least 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.540
 try to learn how to handle 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.570
 forest residues is all in 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.040
 give a lecture in the workshop whenever we 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.710
 We work with a lecture we have 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.800
 lectures in colleges that people 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.510
 It's always laughing, it's got a lot of leaves. 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.130
 many lecture tables and I have done 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.560
 iphan manÃ© that they have searched for and 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.930
 here people have a bag that I saw 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.880
 I told you later, I want a Russian party. 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.250
 for the girls at home because the people 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.070
 call all that is new and animal print 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.080
 and the never goes out of style right? 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.880
 but she has a peculiarity in the rose 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.090
 it may not be used alone 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:37.510
 changed and can be used in this way 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.510
 will allow them to turn another look 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:48.450
 and you have two laps at home do not have 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.590
 two drops raimundo days that still all 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.590
 in fish leather, right? 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.419
 shades not we are working 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.850
 This is what you said about gecoc and 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.350
 resorts to a pet work is a type of pet 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.870
 What, then, when are you going? 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.910
 to report always will know but not 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.770
 only do and it is in these works that I 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.690
 enjoy playing a role 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.350
 then the role you will serve will serve 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.540
 to pack my door card is already going 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.190
 minimizing the company's impacts and 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.010
 people make the production cleaner in 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.840
 of the company and we live with it better 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.180
 like this 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.280
 look at this other one at the key of that bag 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.470
 which is all wood she has three 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.590
 species of wood is not that the laurel 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.419
 black that the pt 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.729
 you can see side of her that we 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.370
 we have the body this people it is wrong 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.850
 because the drum that people like us 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.760
 have the custom is to give assaulting here 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.830
 as if the body the body not the skin with 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.750
 that 's all after he's positive 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.260
 when it opportune fourth he had seen 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:00.240
 A lot of people call if it says here. 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.729
 every bag she was talking about too 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.890
 in the interval one thing something 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.510
 very cool about this 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.940

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.129
