00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:12.899
 The maximum charging capacity of the notebook's battery reduces over time, 

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:18.650
 as a result of which the battery can no longer properly measure the actual charging capacity. 

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:25.403
 Calibrating a battery will reset the battery meter and ensure that the battery is fully charged. 

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:31.213
 This video shows two methods to automatically test and calibrate the battery, 

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:34.784
 as well as a method to manually calibrate the battery. 

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:40.985
 HP System Diagnostics is a useful tool for testing and calibrating the battery. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.214
 To get started, unplug the power cord from the notebook. 

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.574
 Then switch off the notebook. 

00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:55.416
 Wait a few seconds and switch the notebook on again. 

00:00:56.736 --> 00:01:00.286
 Press the Escape key immediately and repeatedly. 

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:08.343
 When the boot menu opens, select System Diagnostics by pressing the F2 key. 

00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:20.179
 When the HP PC Hardware Diagnostics UEFI window opens, click the Battery Test button. 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.546
 The Battery Test window opens and shows the duration of the battery test, 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.066
 and the estimated time for the battery is calibrated. 

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.207
 Click the Start Battery Test button. 

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:43.968
 When the battery test is complete, a window opens with the test results. 

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:50.418
 In this example, the battery passed the test and you do not need to take any action. 

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:59.432
 If the system detects a problem, a short solution to the problem, such as Calibrate or Replace, is displayed here. 

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:03.352
 Follow the instructions on the screen to solve the problem. 

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:09.824
 HP Support Assistant is another tool that you can use to test and calibrate the battery. 

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:14.757
 Start by typing "HP Support Assistant" on the Start screen. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.379
 Select HP Support Assistant in the results list. 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.044
 When HP Support Assistant opens, click the Battery and Performance box. 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.904
 Click the HP Battery Test button. 

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:40.281
 A Test in Progress screen appears, which is displayed until the test is completed. 

00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:43.200
 The result screen is then opened. 

00:02:44.024 --> 00:02:46.877
 In this example, the battery status is OK. 

00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:56.806
 If the HP Support Assistant detects a problem, a short solution to the problem, such as Calibration or Replace, is displayed here. 

00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:00.926
 Follow the instructions on the screen to solve the problem. 

00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:05.395
 You can also manually calibrate the battery of your notebook. 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.253
 During the manual calibration cycle, the battery must be fully charged, fully discharged and then recharged. 

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:23.301
 While the power adapter is connected to the notebook, charge the battery until it reaches 100 percent. 

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:27.824
 After the battery is fully charged, you must fully discharge it. 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.083
 To do this, turn off the notebook and unplug the power cord. 

00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:44.190
 Press the power button to turn on the notebook. 

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:49.555
 Press the Escape key immediately and repeatedly. 

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:57.080
 When the boot menu opens, select System Diagnostics by pressing the F2 key. 

00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:02.732
 Performing the hard disk test is a good way to completely drain the battery. 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.095
 Click on Hard Disk Test and click on the Start Hard Disk Test button. 

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.178
 Click on Extended test. 

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:20.837
 Leave the notebook on until it turns off because the battery is empty. 

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:26.260
 You must then fully recharge the battery. 

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:33.349
 Plug in the power cord and turn on the notebook. 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.091
 If the charge level reaches nearly one hundred percent, you must leave the power cord connected for at least three hours. 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.997
 Perform a battery test to ensure that the battery is properly calibrated. 

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:56.241
 Shut down the notebook while the power cord is still connected. 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.214
 Wait a few seconds and turn on the power again. 

00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.162
 Press the Escape key immediately and repeatedly. 

00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:12.230
 When the boot menu opens, select System Diagnostics by pressing the F2 key. 

00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:15.748
 Select Battery Test. 

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.615
 Click the Start Battery Test button. 

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:26.154
 When the test is completed, the Battery Test shows the calibration status as Passed. 

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:31.595
 If the battery status shows Calibrate, you can try to calibrate the battery again. 

00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:36.423
 The battery may need to be replaced if the battery is still not calibrated. 

00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:48.667
