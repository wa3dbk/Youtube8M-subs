00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.319
 how to make a key holder in which 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.600
 you can give as a gift on a special occasion 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.130
 as it is on valentine's day the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.130
 material that you will need is 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.730
 a board of mdf or the one 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.200
 get two eyebolts paper written with 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.820
 acrylic paint scrapbook ribbon 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.730
 Decorations and base material for 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.340
 start 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 let's take the board that you have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.759
 chosen and add glue all over the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.759
 surface 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.580
 place the table in the corner of the paper 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.460
 with the help of a flat object like 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.540
 this card pastes all edges well 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.780
 of the paper 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.780
 take a cutter and cut by the shore 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.990
 you can skip this step if you want to paint 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.990
 the table with acrylic paint 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.170
 then blending with ink from a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.170
 contrasting color 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.100
 to the shore on our little board 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.970
 cut out a strip of paper 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.200
 You're going to cut it in two and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.640
 let's paste it on the top 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 bottom of our table 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.120
 continue decorating you can download the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.610
 molds that I'll leave in the box 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.610
 of information in this mailbox 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.190
 and this envelope 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 let's put it together we're just going to paste 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 the parts 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.659
 these are stickers 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.720
 and a piece of paper that will go on the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.720
 center of our envelope 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.370
 and make a hole in the part 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.060
 top the tip of the envelope for 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.920
 put a cord cited note where it goes 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.910
 stay your notebook and if you want 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.910
 makes a mark 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.740
 keep decorating in this case I'm 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.740
 using stickers 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.250
 and let's put a cord cited 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.130
 and then we're going to hit each 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.940
 one of our decorations if not 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.580
 you want to make these these decorations 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.150
 you can put stickers and that's a lot 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.150
 easier 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.110
 You can put a piece of ribbon or 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.950
 decorated paper so you have more 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.840
 contrast in strong 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.840
 our envelope 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.850
 you can put buttons instead of these 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.210
 stickers there are buttons of hearts very 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.210
 pretty 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.210
 you are going to grab your weapons 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.560
 and you're going to verify more or less where 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.240
 You want them 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.740
 and how far in this case 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.740
 I'm going to put a brand 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.840
 and it measures 4 centimeters we do the same 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.320
 in the other side 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.170
 and we put a marquita 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.030
 let's turn our eyebolt and with 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.910
 a lot of strength we are going to introduce it into the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.440
 table can be removed a little time 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.440
 but with patience you will be left 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.420
 let's do the same with the other 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:36.370
 Armella and we have ready 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.370
 let's stick our notepad 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.110
 Wherever you want to be found 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:51.580
 I found these letters that are from a 

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:53.700
 word game and I will form the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.450
 word 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.450
 I love you 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.820
 Y 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.090
 to give them away it occurred to me to write 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.090
 a phrase 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.010
 let's put a cord cited in the part 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.300
 from behind I 'm going to fasten it with tape 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.300
 of assembly 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:24.659
 and well this has been all you can omit 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.299
 the eyebolts and you can use it as a 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.059
 simple a simple scrapbook page and 

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:32.879
 give it away I hope you liked it 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:35.849
 forget subscribed and in each of them 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:41.299
 I will write the titles of my 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.299
 stewed recipes desserts and soups
