00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:30.840
 to 22 a very cool conversion issue 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:33.680
 It 's just close, it 's just here. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 follow here 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.539
 come on, question 22 said the following 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.620
 if the memory of a computer has the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:56.329
 size of 64 mega bytes so your 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.730
 storage capacity in bytes is 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:15.979
 how does the official scale scale 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:15.979
 beach byte kilobyte mega byte gigabyte 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.450
 it was byte 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.040
 and here goes wherever I want 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.520
 walk to a house on the left 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 I x 1024 people on our wrong course 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 I stayed almost an hour just doing this 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 conversion type here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 You want to take a look there and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.000
 here is multiply by eight 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 so always x 1024 when it was from bad 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 to the beach multiply by 48 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.079
 so let's go there if a memory of a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.119
 microcomputer has the size of 64 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:11.690
 megawatts do not want me to have 64 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.690
 gigabytes 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.070
 then its storage capacity in 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.410
 Bytes so I want to get in the neighborhood 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.900
 I want to move from megabyte to prom 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.450
 happens that to go from megabyte to 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.140
 Byte I have to go through the kilobyte and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.900
 then to the neighborhood 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 then the scheme is the following I get the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.680
 64 and jumped to the left 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.209
 then I multiply it because 1024 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.860
 only when I take a leap into the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.660
 Left, I arrive in the quilombo haiti 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.480
 but I do not want the bike I want it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.480
 the bike then x 1024 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.640
 Then I found that I want it now. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 if for example if I had 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.489
 request beach 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 then I would have to give one more 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.510
 multiplication this time by 8 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.720
 but as I asked, it hits me and I come to where 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:11.790
 I want the answer here 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:11.790
 math will not give you 67,108 864 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.970
 question 22 is her answer. 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.970
 letter a
