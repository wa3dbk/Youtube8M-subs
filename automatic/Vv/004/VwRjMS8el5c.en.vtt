 security technician at a temperature

 average of 53 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.190
 the difference is not much because it occurred 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.500

 Site y coma in a copper base , it is 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.320
 Sunday makes some noise compared to the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.680
 occur in the case because the curimbó that

 taking the blue 6 thousand rpm and the t4 with it 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.530

 spoon still accept the second wind and 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.830

 see 53 ° for my teacher taking in 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.650
 consider that it is a md and the clock 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.190
 it is in a great great size and if 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.250
 this clean temperature load né in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.140
 stock was in the 34 plus or 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 least in this range 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.340
