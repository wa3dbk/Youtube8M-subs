00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:03.359

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.019
 Whether a cyclist can a cyclist can 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:26.340
 walking in the middle of the road so the cyclist 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.430

 Article 58 of the Code 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.610
 traffic allows this and drivers 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.129
 motor vehicle drivers 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.810
 have to respect one and a half 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.519
 distance to overtake a bicycle and 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.459
