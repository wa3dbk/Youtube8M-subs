yeah<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> refresher<00:00:30.929> all-round<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.920> think

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
yeah like a refresher all-round I think

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
yeah like a refresher all-round I think
might<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.520> good<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.059> old<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:34.110> drink

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
might be good for this old one to drink

might be good for this old one to drink
it's<00:00:34.410> an<00:00:34.500> 81<00:00:34.950> been<00:00:35.940> sitting<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.329> quite<00:00:36.480> some

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it's an 81 been sitting for quite some

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's an 81 been sitting for quite some
time<00:00:37.760> I'm<00:00:38.760> gonna<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> look<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> see

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
time I'm gonna have a look and see

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.069

what's<00:00:39.750> inside<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.559> air<00:00:41.250> filter<00:00:41.700> -<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.300> think

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
what's inside the air filter - I think

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
what's inside the air filter - I think
there<00:00:43.230> might<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.450> character<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
there might be a bit of character in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
there might be a bit of character in

this is a good idea I'm going to use

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.920 
this is a good idea I'm going to use
just<00:01:57.070> some<00:01:57.580> soapy<00:01:58.360> water<00:01:59.850> hot<00:02:00.850> soapy<00:02:01.240> water<00:02:01.270> to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
just some soapy water hot soapy water to

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.330 
just some soapy water hot soapy water to
get<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.080> bit<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.350> oil<00:02:02.530> out<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:02.979> there<00:02:03.130> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
get a bit of that oil out of there and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:15.740 
get a bit of that oil out of there and
then<00:02:03.580> rinse<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.420> off<00:02:04.539> thoroughly<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:13.180> looks<00:02:13.510> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
then rinse it off thoroughly it looks I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100 
then rinse it off thoroughly it looks I
think<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:16.989> bits<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.220> old<00:02:18.430> filter<00:02:19.360> that's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
think that's bits of old filter that's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.500 
think that's bits of old filter that's
come<00:02:21.069> off<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.519> think<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.819> filter<00:02:22.120> has<00:02:22.239> been

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
come off so I think the filter has been

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.050 
come off so I think the filter has been
replaced<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:24.100> an<00:02:24.220> attempt<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.610> get<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.910> going

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
replaced in an attempt to get it going

exciting<00:02:49.120> under<00:02:49.359> there

well<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.230> didn't<00:02:50.560> realize<00:02:50.799> how<00:02:51.160> good<00:02:51.220> condition

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
well I didn't realize how good condition

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.280 
well I didn't realize how good condition
the<00:02:52.000> actual<00:02:52.299> air<00:02:52.480> filter<00:02:52.840> was<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.200> was

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the actual air filter was I was

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.170 
the actual air filter was I was
originally<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.040> reject<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.670> thing<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
originally going to reject the thing and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.349 
originally going to reject the thing and
put<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:56.739> different<00:02:56.920> pod<00:02:57.370> filter<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.940> stuff<00:02:58.150> on

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
put a different pod filter and stuff on

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.910 
put a different pod filter and stuff on
it<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.570> I'm<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.750> two<00:02:58.959> minds<00:02:59.230> about<00:02:59.410> whether<00:02:59.709> I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
it but I'm in two minds about whether I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.470 
it but I'm in two minds about whether I
just<00:03:00.370> restore<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:02.100> whether<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.220> do<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.970> couple

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
just restore it or whether I do a couple

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.599 
just restore it or whether I do a couple
performance<00:03:05.440> modifications<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:06.370> at<00:03:06.489> this

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
performance modifications but at this

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.870 
performance modifications but at this
stage<00:03:06.670> I'm<00:03:07.030> thinking<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.720> might<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.620> keep

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
stage I'm thinking I might just keep

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.000 
stage I'm thinking I might just keep
that<00:03:09.880> system<00:03:10.209> fairly<00:03:10.959> original<00:03:11.200> will<00:03:11.650> remove

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that system fairly original will remove

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.000 
that system fairly original will remove
the<00:03:12.280> back<00:03:12.489> rack<00:03:12.820> which<00:03:13.420> has<00:03:13.630> some<00:03:14.010> restrictors

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
the back rack which has some restrictors

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.949 
the back rack which has some restrictors
for<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> airflow<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.000> may<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.570> little<00:03:16.810> bit

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
for the airflow so I may do a little bit

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.160 
for the airflow so I may do a little bit
of<00:03:17.160> carpentering<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.310> there<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.840> don't

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
of carpentering in there but I don't

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.400 
of carpentering in there but I don't
it's<00:03:20.440> um<00:03:21.250> maybe<00:03:22.000> might<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.570> put<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> pod<00:03:22.959> filter

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it's um maybe might and put a pod filter

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.130 
it's um maybe might and put a pod filter
on<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:23.739> keep<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:25.060> rigid<00:03:25.600> edge

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
on it now keep it a rigid edge

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.040 
on it now keep it a rigid edge
hmm<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.790> anyway<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.270> next<00:03:29.420> step<00:03:29.750> was<00:03:30.020> to

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
hmm so anyway the next step was to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.500 
hmm so anyway the next step was to
disconnect<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.220> carb<00:03:31.460> from<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.850> bike<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.450> I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
disconnect the carb from the bike so I

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.940 
disconnect the carb from the bike so I
could<00:03:32.720> take<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.260> give<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.620> really<00:03:33.830> good

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
could take it and give it a really good

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.850 
could take it and give it a really good
clean<00:03:34.010> over<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.810> unscrewed<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.770> top

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
clean over so I unscrewed the top

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.430 
clean over so I unscrewed the top
section<00:03:37.550> which<00:03:37.730> removes<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.780> needle<00:03:39.170> and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
section which removes the the needle and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.190 
section which removes the the needle and
the<00:03:40.070> throttle<00:03:40.430> cable<00:03:40.700> from<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.180> car<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:42.080> then

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
the throttle cable from the car and then

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.710 
the throttle cable from the car and then
just<00:03:42.230> unbolted<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.100> rest<00:03:43.310> now<00:03:44.180> when<00:03:44.360> removing

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
just unbolted the rest now when removing

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.240 
just unbolted the rest now when removing
the<00:03:45.080> fuel<00:03:45.770> lines<00:03:46.100> from<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.960> petcock<00:03:47.960> just<00:03:48.680> be

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
the fuel lines from the petcock just be

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.370 
the fuel lines from the petcock just be
careful<00:03:49.670> if<00:03:49.850> they're<00:03:50.090> all<00:03:50.300> not<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.900> not<00:03:51.260> to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
careful if they're all not to not to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.500 
careful if they're all not to not to
crack<00:03:51.620> them<00:03:51.830> probably<00:03:52.370> won't<00:03:52.940> want<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.120> reuse

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
crack them probably won't want to reuse

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.410 
crack them probably won't want to reuse
all<00:03:53.750> few<00:03:54.080> lines<00:03:54.380> anyway<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.940> may<00:03:56.240> be<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
all few lines anyway so this may be a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.420 
all few lines anyway so this may be a
good<00:03:56.630> opportunity<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.530> look<00:03:58.010> at<00:03:58.160> replacing

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
good opportunity to look at replacing

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.730 
good opportunity to look at replacing
them<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.300> of<00:03:59.600> course<00:03:59.780> remember<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.530> drain

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
them and of course remember to drain

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.560 
them and of course remember to drain
your<00:04:00.920> float<00:04:01.130> because<00:04:01.520> otherwise<00:04:02.150> you'll<00:04:02.480> get

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
your float because otherwise you'll get

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:09.430 
your float because otherwise you'll get
petrol<00:04:02.930> everywhere<00:04:07.959> now<00:04:08.959> you're<00:04:09.110> ready<00:04:09.290> to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
petrol everywhere now you're ready to

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.530 
petrol everywhere now you're ready to
take<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.770> carp<00:04:09.980> apart<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.520> started<00:04:11.030> by<00:04:11.120> taking

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
take the carp apart I started by taking

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.330 
take the carp apart I started by taking
the<00:04:11.750> float<00:04:12.140> off<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.350> bottom<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.860> check<00:04:13.160> what

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
the float off the bottom to check what

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.910 
the float off the bottom to check what
was<00:04:13.430> going<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.630> inside<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.350> was<00:04:15.560> bloody

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
was going on on the inside it was bloody

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.370 
was going on on the inside it was bloody
awful<00:04:16.040> this<00:04:16.489> thing<00:04:16.700> is<00:04:16.850> full<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.180> gunk<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:17.930> need

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
awful this thing is full of gunk so need

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.590 
awful this thing is full of gunk so need
to<00:04:18.560> give<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.890> really<00:04:19.250> doing<00:04:19.760> now<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.090> use<00:04:20.329> some

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
to give it a really doing now I use some

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.600 
to give it a really doing now I use some
wd-40<00:04:21.290> other<00:04:21.709> people<00:04:22.070> would<00:04:22.190> probably<00:04:22.310> like

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
out they will wear out with a little

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.960 
out they will wear out with a little
rubber<00:04:48.350> tip<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.950> one's<00:04:49.160> pretty<00:04:49.430> good<00:04:49.490> and

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
I thought it's generally because these

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.240 
I thought it's generally because these
ones<00:04:55.550> were<00:04:55.790> worn<00:04:56.240> out<00:04:56.479> anyway<00:04:57.080> next<00:04:57.710> up<00:04:57.919> was<00:04:58.100> to

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
ones were worn out anyway next up was to

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.570 
ones were worn out anyway next up was to
check<00:04:58.490> my<00:04:58.870> jets<00:04:59.870> now<00:05:00.200> these<00:05:00.680> dad's<00:05:00.950> one<00:05:01.220> mega

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
check my jets now these dad's one mega

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.420 
check my jets now these dad's one mega
clogged<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.630> got<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> thin<00:05:03.770> piece<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.190> wire

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430

clogged so I got a thin piece of wire
thinner<00:05:04.850> than<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.210> hole<00:05:05.390> and<00:05:05.720> got<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:06.050> there

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
thinner than the hole and got in there

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.310 
thinner than the hole and got in there
and<00:05:06.380> clean<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.710> out<00:05:06.950> then<00:05:07.370> used<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.820> bit<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.090> my

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
and clean it out then used a bit of my

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.050 
and clean it out then used a bit of my

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
solvent spray it too and make sure it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.510 
solvent spray it too and make sure it
was<00:05:11.150> all<00:05:11.360> flying<00:05:11.690> well<00:05:11.990> give<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.979> a<00:05:13.010> good<00:05:13.220> clean

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520
