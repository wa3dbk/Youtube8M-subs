00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.870
 the president is unaware of some 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.500
 things I think 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.240
 and so this part and weighed very 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 he was thinking that I wanted to send in 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.009
 game 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.070
 I wanted to continue but I did not want to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.580
 that he died so I went and let's go 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.800
 make an ad of will not show up 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.530
 other people from other sports I 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.540
 I hope this does not exist as it is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 thought our president the club 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.760
 really climb 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 all because it will take our very good 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 Let's assume this is how it gets 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 level leaves we have no condition in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.750
 Tom releases people 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.900
 this is what he did not crucify this 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.650
 person that brought it because I'm 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.170
 Speaking 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.360
 we still talk about the relationship though 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.090
 I 'm in shape the general relationship I think 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 people who dedicated their lives to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.799
 all in Rome 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.799
 rock in the olodum 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.850
 He wanted to send it. He wanted to send it. 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.560
 He says nothing, I'm very 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.860
 proud of the things I do because 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.610
 I know how the sacrifice to do 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.880
 But I think we did a good job. 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.549
 I work here recovering basketball from people 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.770
 set up a legal structure we did 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.929
 something like what I saw here tÃ¡ 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.810
 finish you need to encourage 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.930
 the mirror 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.689
 the mirror has a greater spirit than this 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.850
 who brought a kiss 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.380
 see my situation and this is what I 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:01.479
 so that is why not accept the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.950
 note is day 31 everyone knows that I am 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.979
 traveling together with two children 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 therapist for this is in atlanta 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.390
 everybody knows is so much that's why 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.890
 that I did not go to the South American 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.330
 That's why I 'm not going to be nice. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.720
 needed by the nation then be voted on 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.519
 day 30 I was going because so I know 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.000
 I have people who will do this. 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.870
 I work but I'm all team out. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.440
 I 'm with German who would be the other 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 just right out too and when I 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.140
 he comes and I'm leaving 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.140
 so I wanted to solve the main problems 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 things before you travel or stay in place 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.860
 how much to talk 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.930
 the business is going to have to the saints know that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.299
 day 10 arrives from two and a half in the afternoon at 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.950
 6 hours you are performing with the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.900
 team 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.849
 Who will send it to you? 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.470
 I know I have people but you. 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.989
 gets crazy 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.590
 So what I want, changes the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.069
 main things that is an aspect of the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.590
 block until the end of next week 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.769
 there is something that is to mount the idea of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.450
 mount now of course I'll need 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.090
 step on floor table 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.939
 It's the rest I 'll play together but I'm going 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.190
 to listen to that we are champions of 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.350
 new in brazil 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.480
 The team that I do not know why I go 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.830
 shout art 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.980
 But that 's my frustration. 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.980
 great
