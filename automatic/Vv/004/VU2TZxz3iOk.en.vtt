00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.180 

suppressors<00:00:10.929> are<00:00:11.080> great<00:00:11.230> safety<00:00:11.469> tools<00:00:11.860> buy

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
suppressors are great safety tools buy

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.070 
suppressors are great safety tools buy
safety<00:00:12.519> tools<00:00:12.700> I<00:00:12.849> mean<00:00:13.030> that<00:00:13.150> they<00:00:13.240> reduce<00:00:13.809> the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
safety tools I mean that they reduce the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.869 
safety tools I mean that they reduce the
report<00:00:14.230> of<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:14.679> firearm<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.190> levels<00:00:15.670> where<00:00:15.849> you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
show you guys is when you buy a

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.900 
show you guys is when you buy a
suppressor<00:00:27.099> for<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.310> first<00:00:27.490> time<00:00:27.699> for<00:00:27.880> a

of anti-seize which I have here and a
cute<00:00:36.640> tip<00:00:36.879> I<00:00:37.980> put<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.070> anti-seize<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:39.670> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
cute tip I put the anti-seize on the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.139 
cute tip I put the anti-seize on the
threads<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:43.059> prevent<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.539> can<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:45.730> seizing

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149

on the threads of the barrel just put a

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.340 
on the threads of the barrel just put a
little<00:00:49.600> bit<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.930> threads<00:00:50.170> like<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:52.350> now

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
little bit on the threads like that now

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.650 
little bit on the threads like that now
you<00:00:53.410> can<00:00:53.649> screw<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.070> can<00:00:54.280> onto<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.120> firearm<00:00:55.570> a

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
ceasing to those threads now which will

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.779 
ceasing to those threads now which will
happen<00:01:12.560> cuz<00:01:12.860> carbon<00:01:13.250> builds<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.579> on<00:01:13.640> those

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
firearm now the next thing that I like

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.029 
firearm now the next thing that I like
to<00:01:17.659> do<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.929> to<00:01:18.079> look<00:01:18.229> down<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.500> bore<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
to do is to look down the bore of the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.219 
to do is to look down the bore of the
rifling<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:20.090> make<00:01:20.329> sure<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:20.899> I'm<00:01:21.020> looking

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
rifling to make sure that as I'm looking

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.279 
rifling to make sure that as I'm looking
through<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.280> barrel<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.810> baffles

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
through the barrel that the baffles

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.370 
through the barrel that the baffles
don't<00:01:24.610> interfere<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:26.329> my<00:01:26.479> line<00:01:26.720> of<00:01:26.750> sight<00:01:26.929> if

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
don't interfere with my line of sight if

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.960 
don't interfere with my line of sight if
I<00:01:27.470> see<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.710> full<00:01:28.009> circle<00:01:28.429> and<00:01:28.520> not<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> Halfmoon

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
I see a full circle and not a Halfmoon

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.300 
I see a full circle and not a Halfmoon
it<00:01:29.539> means<00:01:29.929> that<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.590> lining<00:01:31.009> up<00:01:31.130> it's

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it means that the can is lining up it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.590 
it means that the can is lining up it's
just<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.520> safety<00:01:31.880> check<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.240> make<00:01:32.360> sure<00:01:32.509> that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
just a safety check to make sure that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.569 
just a safety check to make sure that
the<00:01:32.750> bullet<00:01:33.049> doesn't<00:01:33.259> strike<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:34.130> suppressor

the bullet doesn't strike the suppressor

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.039 
the bullet doesn't strike the suppressor
that's<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:34.909> end<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.149> barrel<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.539> this

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
that's on the end of the barrel in this

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.450 
that's on the end of the barrel in this
case<00:01:36.259> everything<00:01:36.560> seems<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.979> line<00:01:37.159> up<00:01:37.310> just

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
case everything seems to line up just

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.309 
case everything seems to line up just
fine<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.420> put<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:38.810> weapon<00:01:39.170> back

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
fine and I can put this weapon back

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.620 
fine and I can put this weapon back
together<00:01:39.469> again<00:01:43.030> once<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.119> get<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.299> firearm

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
together again once you get the firearm

together again once you get the firearm
back<00:01:44.780> together<00:01:44.959> you've<00:01:45.439> checked<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.159> make

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
back together you've checked to make

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.740 
back together you've checked to make
sure<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.789> proper<00:01:46.909> bore<00:01:47.299> alignment
