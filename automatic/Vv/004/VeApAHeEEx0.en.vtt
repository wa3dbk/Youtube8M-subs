00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello markus here from markus fotos.de 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.600
 Today with a quicktipp to photoshop 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.580
 and that's about the picture here 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.960
 just on the screen sees that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.670
 the julia made and she likes to be 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 use wallpaper there is there 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 two points they storm 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 that's one of those things down here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
 right in the corner and these are the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.740
 leaves are here on the side and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 if you send this now if I am 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.250
 would like to give you then would not know 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 you probably for example 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.269
 Try the following because of the background 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 handle a color is thinking one calls 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.760
 you look at the pipette tool gets you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 the blue so you can paint with it then 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.520
 times the brush and then you start 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.379
 to do about it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 the problem with this method is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.739
 however that one actually 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.840
 afterwards and I hope you can do that too 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 in the video now you can see that here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 behind where I now long with the mouse 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 drive actually sees that edge and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 it just does not look pretty 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.289
 That's why we're just doing that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.690
 Undo again and now I show 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 you like that in my picture what so 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 is like this one with this one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.189
 a colorful background how to do that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
 can do much better and that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.240
 I even zoom just a tad out 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.280
 then you can do something right away 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 I recognize it better and I take it here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 at the top of the corner is the rectangle selection 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 Tool and mark now here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.080
 this whole area until just before 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 my real motive so it may 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 Do not go over the motive that is allowed 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.509
 motive also do not touch it but it 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.100
 just before that is enough 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.390
 Now I've chosen that and what 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.430
 I now I'm going back up 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 edit and freely transform or 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.659
 because it should go fast I press 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.570
 stand and that makes exactly the same and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 then I get hold of this corner 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
 and that's why I chose it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
 you will be able to recognize this better 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 What I'm doing you grab this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.189
 touch the mouse with the button 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.560
 pressed and now just pull the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.320
 leaves here from the picture and that way 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 they are just out 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.049
 let go of the whole thing and now I have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.159
 very wonderful the leaves there on away 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.730
 the other side I do the whole thing 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.980
 just like you like curth again 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.890
 press control tea and we pull now 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.400
 here also this little fitzel in the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.280
 just push the corner out of the picture 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.070
 here again so and if that confirm 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 whole now again in the size 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.130
 then look you see here without that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.590
 you kinda cloud a color or 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.510
 We see the whole thing similar 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.710
 nicely cleaned up in the background her 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.870
 You can always use it like that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.910
 said if he like a smooth one here 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.620
 a colored or next time 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.900
 monochrome look background have that 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.210
 works great on recordings 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.700
 from the studio so in front of gray white or 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.500
 black background without great 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.270
 structure if you like that, for example 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.520
 have a corner of the softbox in it or 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.530
 on the legs of the tripod then you can 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.660
 that also used or just of such 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.190
 just shoot the sky 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.760
 Mark area and laterally 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.430
 pull out 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.930
 I hope the quicktipp was sorry 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.340
 useful for you and if that's you 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 video has fallen presses the thumb 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.310
 high or subscribe to the channel if you like 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.530
