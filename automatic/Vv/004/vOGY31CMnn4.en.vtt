00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
also the volume flow rate volume of flow

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.010 
also the volume flow rate volume of flow
per<00:01:03.470> unit<00:01:03.500> time<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:05.509> Bernoulli's

per unit time and the Bernoulli's
equation<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.070> tells<00:01:07.310> us<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.850> pressure<00:01:08.600> plus

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
equation that tells us the pressure plus

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.160

1/2 Rho V squared plus the Rho Gy is a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.249 
1/2 Rho V squared plus the Rho Gy is a
constant<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.250> in<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:14.330> case<00:01:14.630> we're<00:01:15.080> going<00:01:15.200> to

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
constant and in this case we're going to

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.520 
constant and in this case we're going to
use<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.710> Bernoulli's<00:01:16.159> equation<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.350> is

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
use the Bernoulli's equation so this is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.100 
use the Bernoulli's equation so this is
the<00:01:18.820> Bernoulli's<00:01:19.820> equation<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.660> I'm<00:01:21.080> going

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
the Bernoulli's equation and I'm going

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.469 
the Bernoulli's equation and I'm going
to<00:01:21.380> call<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:21.800> part<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.250> fluid<00:01:22.640> 1<00:01:23.180> and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
to call this part of the fluid 1 and

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.609 
to call this part of the fluid 1 and
this<00:01:24.229> part<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.770> fluid<00:01:24.979> -<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.630> what<00:01:26.840> P<00:01:27.080> 1<00:01:27.380> is

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
this part of the fluid - so what P 1 is

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.219 
this part of the fluid - so what P 1 is
the<00:01:27.680> pressure<00:01:27.950> right<00:01:28.700> over<00:01:29.000> here<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:29.929> this

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
the pressure right over here now this

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.340 
the pressure right over here now this
water<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.979> exposed<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> atmosphere<00:01:32.350> so

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
water is exposed to the atmosphere so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.460 
water is exposed to the atmosphere so
the<00:01:33.500> pressure<00:01:33.800> up<00:01:34.160> there<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.479> atmospheric

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
the pressure up there is the atmospheric

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.029 
the pressure up there is the atmospheric
pressure<00:01:37.600> although<00:01:38.600> probably<00:01:39.259> all<00:01:39.590> water

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
pressure although probably all water

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.540 
pressure although probably all water
towers<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:41.360> covers<00:01:41.869> over<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.350> top<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
towers have covers over the top the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
surface of the water is still exposed to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.980 
surface of the water is still exposed to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the atmosphere in the atmospheric

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.230 
the atmosphere in the atmospheric
pressure<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:49.009> covers<00:01:49.430> are<00:01:49.670> not<00:01:49.909> airtight

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
pressure the covers are not airtight

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.600 
pressure the covers are not airtight
they<00:01:51.170> are<00:01:51.229> just<00:01:51.530> there<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.740> keep<00:01:52.130> things<00:01:52.189> from

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
they are just there to keep things from

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.480 
they are just there to keep things from
falling<00:01:52.670> into<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.420> water<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.100> then<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.280> have

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
falling into the water and then we have

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.120 
falling into the water and then we have
the<00:01:55.640> one-half<00:01:56.090> Rho<00:01:56.119> v1<00:01:56.659> squared<00:01:57.380> now<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the one-half Rho v1 squared now the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.840 
the one-half Rho v1 squared now the
water<00:01:59.119> tanks<00:01:59.720> are<00:01:59.930> usually<00:02:00.590> very<00:02:01.040> big<00:02:01.460> much

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
water tanks are usually very big much

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.910 
water tanks are usually very big much
much<00:02:02.060> bigger<00:02:02.299> than<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.840> cross<00:02:03.409> sectional

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

much bigger than the cross sectional
area<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.610> faucet<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.750> when<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.290> faucet<00:02:06.710> is

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
area of the faucet so when the faucet is

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.400 
area of the faucet so when the faucet is
on<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.520> water<00:02:07.759> level<00:02:08.239> in<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.540> tower<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:09.170> going

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
on the water level in the tower is going

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.940 
on the water level in the tower is going
to<00:02:09.829> go<00:02:10.070> down<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.709> down

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
to go down but it's going to go down

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.620 
to go down but it's going to go down
very<00:02:13.280> very<00:02:13.489> slowly<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.380> speed<00:02:16.160> over<00:02:17.090> here

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
very very slowly so the speed over here

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.940 
very very slowly so the speed over here
is<00:02:18.160> almost<00:02:19.160> zero<00:02:20.290> another<00:02:21.290> way<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> look<00:02:21.799> at

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
is almost zero another way to look at

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
is almost zero another way to look at
this<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:23.030> 1<00:02:23.540> v1<00:02:23.750> equals<00:02:24.410> 2<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.920> 2<00:02:25.010> v2<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
this is a 1 v1 equals 2 a 2 v2 the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
this is a 1 v1 equals 2 a 2 v2 the
cross-sectional<00:02:27.530> area<00:02:27.590> over<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.579> is<00:02:28.670> very

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
cross-sectional area over here is very

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.979 
cross-sectional area over here is very
very<00:02:29.450> big

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
very big

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.060 
very big
much<00:02:30.290> bigger<00:02:30.560> than<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.980> 2<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.390> v1<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.590> much

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
much bigger than a 2 so the v1 is much

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.550 
much bigger than a 2 so the v1 is much
much<00:02:34.280> smaller<00:02:34.760> which<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.510> going<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.470> be

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
much smaller which is going to be

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.289 
much smaller which is going to be
negligible<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.459> we're<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.850> use<00:02:37.940> zero

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
negligible so we're going to use zero

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.009 
negligible so we're going to use zero
for<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> speed<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.380> 1<00:02:39.829> at<00:02:40.100> 1<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.450> height<00:02:41.750> is

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
for the speed at 1 at 1 the height is

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.610 
for the speed at 1 at 1 the height is
the<00:02:42.400> 6<00:02:43.400> meters<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.660> we<00:02:44.690> need<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.140> put<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the 6 meters so we need to put in the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.160 
the 6 meters so we need to put in the
density<00:02:46.459> I'm<00:02:46.910> actually<00:02:47.209> not<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.900> put<00:02:48.049> in

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
density I'm actually not going to put in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.349 
density I'm actually not going to put in
the<00:02:48.290> density<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.430> can<00:02:49.579> see<00:02:49.850> later<00:02:50.209> on

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
the density because you can see later on

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.960 
the density because you can see later on
that<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.290> density<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.250> cancel<00:02:52.519> and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
that the density is going to cancel and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.000 
that the density is going to cancel and
then<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.840> G<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.349> 10<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.099> height<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.700> 6<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
then the G is 10 the height is 6 on the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.900 
then the G is 10 the height is 6 on the
other<00:02:58.160> side

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
other side

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.870

the<00:02:59.000> open<00:02:59.390> faucet<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.620> water<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.760> be

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
the open faucet the water is going to be

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.750 
the open faucet the water is going to be
exposed<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:03.070> atmosphere<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.580> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
exposed to the atmosphere so the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.540 
exposed to the atmosphere so the
pressure<00:03:05.120> here<00:03:05.330> at<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.440> water<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
pressure here at the water is the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.900 
pressure here at the water is the
atmospheric<00:03:08.420> pressure<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.700> don't

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
atmospheric pressure and then we don't

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.050 
atmospheric pressure and then we don't
know<00:03:11.120> how<00:03:11.870> fast<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.530> speed<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.160> flow<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.730> we're

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
know how fast the speed of flow is we're

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.830 
know how fast the speed of flow is we're
looking<00:03:14.510> for<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> v2<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:16.210> over<00:03:17.210> here<00:03:17.630> of

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
looking for the v2 and over here of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.950 
looking for the v2 and over here of
course<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.680> Y<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.640> zero<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.210> then<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
course the Y is the zero and then the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.140 
course the Y is the zero and then the
atmospheric<00:03:21.290> pressure<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.370> course<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:23.000> can

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
atmospheric pressure of course we can

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.810 
atmospheric pressure of course we can
cancel<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.870> then<00:03:24.410> for<00:03:24.710> these<00:03:24.860> two<00:03:25.130> terms<00:03:25.370> both

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
cancel and then for these two terms both

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.560 
cancel and then for these two terms both
of<00:03:26.060> these<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.600> density<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.550> density<00:03:28.850> can

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
of these have density so the density can

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.460 
of these have density so the density can
also<00:03:29.900> cancel<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:31.730> means<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.240> we<00:03:32.330> get<00:03:32.510> 16

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
also cancel that means that we get 16

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.420 
also cancel that means that we get 16
equals<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.250> 1/2<00:03:34.910> v2<00:03:35.840> squared<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.800> we'll<00:03:37.310> be

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
equals to 1/2 v2 squared and we'll be

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.360 
equals to 1/2 v2 squared and we'll be

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
able to solve for v2 it is square root

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.450 
able to solve for v2 it is square root
of<00:03:40.520> 120<00:03:41.330> which<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.960> about<00:03:42.320> ten<00:03:42.830> point<00:03:43.250> nine

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
of 120 which is about ten point nine

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.750 
of 120 which is about ten point nine
five<00:03:44.090> meters<00:03:44.840> per<00:03:44.870> second<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
five meters per second so that's the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.550 
five meters per second so that's the
speed<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.360> water<00:03:47.570> coming<00:03:47.960> out<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.440> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
speed of the water coming out of the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.100 
speed of the water coming out of the
faucet<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.240> reality<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.080> course

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
faucet and the in reality of course

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.020 
faucet and the in reality of course
water<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.800> going<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.980> come<00:03:52.040> out<00:03:52.310> much<00:03:52.610> slower

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
water is going to come out much slower

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.630 
water is going to come out much slower
than<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.960> speed<00:03:54.200> because<00:03:54.890> there<00:03:55.370> is

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
than the speed because there is

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.660 
than the speed because there is
viscosity<00:03:56.530> which<00:03:57.530> means<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.490> water

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
viscosity which means that the water

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.530 
viscosity which means that the water
flow<00:03:59.120> would<00:03:59.360> lose<00:03:59.690> energy<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:02.060> case<00:04:02.300> if

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
flow would lose energy just in case if

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.500 
flow would lose energy just in case if
you<00:04:02.720> haven't<00:04:03.170> noticed<00:04:03.590> we<00:04:04.550> can<00:04:04.760> actually<00:04:05.300> get

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the same answer if we use the mg y

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.990 
the same answer if we use the mg y

answer this means if I release a ball

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.300 
answer this means if I release a ball

from rest at this height and then it

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.520 
from rest at this height and then it
falls<00:04:31.580> down<00:04:31.760> by<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.240> time<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.870> ball<00:04:33.080> gets<00:04:33.380> to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
falls down by the time the ball gets to

falls down by the time the ball gets to
the<00:04:33.740> same<00:04:34.160> height<00:04:34.490> as<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.730> faucet<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.630> ball

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
the same height as the faucet the ball

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.120 
the same height as the faucet the ball
would<00:04:36.530> reach<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.400> same<00:04:37.430> speed<00:04:38.710> just<00:04:39.710> like<00:04:39.830> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
would reach the same speed just like the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.720 
would reach the same speed just like the
water<00:04:40.990> however<00:04:41.990> we<00:04:42.590> still<00:04:42.860> should<00:04:43.160> use<00:04:43.400> the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
water however we still should use the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.940 
water however we still should use the
Bernoulli's<00:04:44.360> equation<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.470> solve<00:04:45.770> this

Bernoulli's equation to solve this

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.770 
Bernoulli's equation to solve this
problem<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.640> we're<00:04:47.330> working<00:04:47.570> with

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
problem because we're working with

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.920 
problem because we're working with
flowing<00:04:48.230> fluids<00:04:48.830> on<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.610> AP<00:04:49.940> exam<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.720> will

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
flowing fluids on the AP exam you will

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.220 
flowing fluids on the AP exam you will
lose<00:04:51.169> points<00:04:51.560> if<00:04:51.890> you<00:04:52.310> use<00:04:52.550> mg<00:04:53.150> y<00:04:53.330> equals

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.260 
lose points if you use mg y equals
one-half<00:04:54.680> MV<00:04:54.860> squared<00:04:55.040> for<00:04:55.610> flowing<00:04:55.970> fluid
