00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
our company is called animated language

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.410 
our company is called animated language
learning<00:00:02.310> are<00:00:02.700> all<00:00:02.939> for<00:00:03.570> short<00:00:03.780> we<00:00:04.319> develop

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
learning are all for short we develop

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.370 
learning are all for short we develop
software<00:00:07.010> which<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.309> turn<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:09.210> deployed<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
software which in turn is deployed to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.419 
software which in turn is deployed to
develop<00:00:11.010> language<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:12.440> children<00:00:13.440> who<00:00:14.250> have

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
develop language in children who have

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.230 
develop language in children who have
difficulty<00:00:15.590> acquiring<00:00:17.240> communication

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
difficulty acquiring communication

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.070 
difficulty acquiring communication
skills

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
skills

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.710 
skills
so<00:00:19.410> basically<00:00:19.920> myself<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> Val<00:00:20.850> work

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
so basically myself and Val work

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.130 
so basically myself and Val work
together<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.410> build<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:23.039> multinational<00:00:23.640> team

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
together to build a multinational team

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.740 
together to build a multinational team
which<00:00:25.140> included<00:00:25.740> some<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> leading

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
which included some of the leading

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.929 
which included some of the leading
professionals<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.740> medical<00:00:28.769> area<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
professionals in the medical area in the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.670 
professionals in the medical area in the
world<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.380> basically<00:00:31.619> found<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.430> way<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
world and we basically found a way to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.049 
world and we basically found a way to
engage<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:35.219> people<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.260> could

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
engage these people so that they could

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
engage these people so that they could
work<00:00:39.059> together<00:00:39.270> even<00:00:40.110> though<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.590> did<00:00:40.860> not

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
work together even though they did not

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
work together even though they did not
understand<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.750> sciences<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.950> their<00:00:44.309> team

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
understand the sciences of their team

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.790 
understand the sciences of their team
members<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:46.649> basically<00:00:47.010> evolve<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
members and to basically evolve out a

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
members and to basically evolve out a
technically<00:00:49.800> derive<00:00:50.250> solution<00:00:51.140> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
technically derive solution to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
technically derive solution to
establishing<00:00:52.829> language<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.610> these<00:00:53.760> children

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
establishing language in these children

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.439 
establishing language in these children
