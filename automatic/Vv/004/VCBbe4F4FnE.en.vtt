00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.750
 Today I'm going to explain a technique 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.030
 decorative painting called veined 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.430
 veined is nothing but a 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.870
 imitation of the veins of the wood as 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.790
 we are going to do it 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.440
 well with this tool this 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.750
 tool is a hitter and consists of 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.560
 two parts a first part with these 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.050
 wavy areas 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.560
 and a second part with these teeth 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.640
 that will be useful for combing well 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.800
 we have prepared our 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.100
 wall is perfectly tilted and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.680
 we have chosen a broken white color for 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.990
 that you see the contrast of the grain we are going 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.540
 to apply on it a blue paint and 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.100
 first of all and very important we're going 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.500
 to dilute with water so that after 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:09.940
 when we pass our grain we leave 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:12.490
 well the mark of the beautiful well well a 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.520
 Once we have thrown our water with the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 help of a small brooch 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 we started to dilute it perfectly 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 and we're going to start applying with our 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.049
 Roller as always a thread roller 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.340
 short and as always you have to wet a 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.340
 little before painting 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.710
 two 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.570
 coming back once we have applied 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.310
 we take the batter and it is very important 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.010
 that you notice in the movement that I do 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.490
 by hand the important thing is to start 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.800
 from a corner and have the dt a d'or a 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.770
 about 45 degrees from here 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.380
 we started to slide it moving it in 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.380
 this sense to create our candle 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.060
 when you see that this has already been loaded 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.349
 too much then we take a little bit of 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.349
 paper and we clean it 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.530
 do not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.330
 ah 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.020
 very well then I only recommend you 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.690
 that you take a piece of wood, choose the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.580
 color and create the effects but that is 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.580
 does practicing a little a lot of encouragement
