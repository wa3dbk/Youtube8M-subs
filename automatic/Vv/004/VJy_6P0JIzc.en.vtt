00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.980
 came out of the light that the game of a bi 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 launched in early 2015 in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.420
 2015 and if here what you go beyond 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 part of the afternoon do everything here a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 collection of items and collected that you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 need because at night the thing stays 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 ugly you're going to have to end zombies 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 or they will kill you and beauty 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 this game has a nice repercussion until 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 It is a game was the game that is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.260
 happened closed 13 chan ex four 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.579
 boston 69 years went from 17 platform 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 That's where the studio is from now on. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.230
 it will not come out any more for the 60's 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.600
 nor for Playstation 3 because Carol 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 according to the studio he said that they 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.039
 decided to cancel the versions 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.129
 PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.920
 old consoles can not run the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.920
 play and respect the central vision of the game 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.530
 simultaneously 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.660
 Another thing they also said is that the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.760
 game lighting is based on physics 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 central aspects of gameplay as 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.860
 a natural movement and are not possible 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 technologies are not advanced 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.600
 what thing we have seen several games 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 What is in you look at the ps3 playstation 4 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.580
 there was no difference and according to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.710
 techland producer here from west dae 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 shot that could not be done 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.119
 playstation 3 game featuring 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 two things I think about it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.400
 first thing can be a good thing because 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.740
 because the game can finally be there 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.020
 reaching the maximum you can roll 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 new generation or even why 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.440
 simply people who had projection 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.800
 3d will be able to play this if it really 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.420
 is the technological advance and you stay 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.870
 impressed with the game in the organization 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.130
 nice but if you play like the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.380
 time this 13 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.570
 there the producer will have to explain himself 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 why does a game look like 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 graphics that initiatives that rain 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.070
 can not is made you suffer do not know that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.740
 the life-cycle of life and release 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.110
 I ended up finishing next year and we are cute 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.720
 title afterwards will not have more I think 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.030
 by 2016 will not have any more of 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.940
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 titles 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.320
 So it's good that you're already thinking about 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.320
