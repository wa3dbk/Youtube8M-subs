00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello youtube friends today we are going to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.830
 proceed to test him 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.810
 clutch to a golf volkswagen 1004 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.220
 year 96 gasoline engine 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.780
 we proceed to start the vehicle one 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.080
 Once we have started the vehicle 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.779
 let's put the first one they can 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.990
 observe in the video we put the first 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.270
 and without using the right foot stepping 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.009
 the accelerator we are going to cancel the foot 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.640
 right therefore let's drop the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:37.140
 clutch very little to little to see the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.210
 reaction that the car has in this case 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.820
 the car goes perfectly 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.840
 for example I have stepped on no foot and the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.530
 car goes at a speed of 5 kilometers 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.120
 per hour what tells us that is 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 enough ease of our clutch 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.900
 it is not a very reliable test 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.380
 this test would have to be done in a 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.290
 workshop obviously then what are we going 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.060
 to do is to make the lock in a march 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.720
 longer to be a little bit longer 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 sure of our suspicions we proceed 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.390
 to get the road back on track 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.550
 this case 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 and when we are 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.230
 to stop for more the car 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.580
 absolutely everything and what we do 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.220
 it's going to be put second 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.620
 eye this test is not convenient to do it very 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 followed and we do not want to annoy the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.330
 Clutch therefore do everything 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.030
 the same operation with the second gear 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.610
 put we are removing the foot of the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 clutch bit by bit I repeat very 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.840
 little by little without stepping under 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 accelerator and we see the reaction of the car 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.120
 in this case, he keeps walking even though 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.620
 light the light a little as if 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.200
 I was going to open it but keep giving a 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.690
 speed of more than 10 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.330
 kilometers per hour so we 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.700
 indicates that our clutch in this case 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.510
 the clutch of this car is coming 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.510
 at the end of its life so friends 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 will touch us workshop and loosen the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.810
 pockets greetings to all and many 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.810
 Thank you
