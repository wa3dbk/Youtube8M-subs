terr<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.850> fairly<00:00:45.059> interesting

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
terr so that's a fairly interesting

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
terr so that's a fairly interesting
rumor<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.739> say<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> least<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> could

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
rumor to say the least I think it could

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
rumor to say the least I think it could
be<00:00:48.420> quite<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> cool<00:00:48.989> mode<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.710> providing

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
be quite a cool mode actually providing

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
be quite a cool mode actually providing
is<00:00:50.309> balanced<00:00:50.850> fairly<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> obviously<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
is balanced fairly well and obviously it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.889 
is balanced fairly well and obviously it
won't<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> serious<00:00:53.100> mode<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> by<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
won't be a serious mode and by which you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
won't be a serious mode and by which you
know<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.289> hopefully<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.340> part

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
know it's not hopefully going to be part

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.920 
know it's not hopefully going to be part
of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> storyline<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.329> anything<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of the storyline or anything like that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.920 
of the storyline or anything like that
but<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:59.010> could<00:00:59.280> work<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.180> game<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
but it could work for the game I have to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.709 
but it could work for the game I have to
say<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.500> indeed<00:01:02.460> would<00:01:02.670> work<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:02.940> similar

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
say and indeed would work very similar

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
say and indeed would work very similar
to<00:01:03.750> say<00:01:04.199> residi<00:01:04.830> 46<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.820> players<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to say residi 46 where your players a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.480 
to say residi 46 where your players a
zombie<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.409> respect<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> lot<00:01:08.220> cooler

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
zombie in one respect but a lot cooler

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
zombie in one respect but a lot cooler
as<00:01:09.060> obviously<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> play<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.140> an

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
as obviously if you get to play as an

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.380 
as obviously if you get to play as an
actual<00:01:10.560> villain<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.909> access<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
actual villain and you have access to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
actual villain and you have access to
all<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.840> particular<00:01:13.140> abilities<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
all of their particular abilities it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.030 
all of their particular abilities it
could<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> quite<00:01:14.909> fun<00:01:15.740> traditionally<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
could be quite fun traditionally the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
could be quite fun traditionally the
batman<00:01:17.430> arkham<00:01:17.700> games<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> course<00:01:18.659> been

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
batman arkham games have of course been

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
batman arkham games have of course been
single<00:01:19.500> player<00:01:19.680> focus<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.140> honestly

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
single player focus only and honestly

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
single player focus only and honestly
i've<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.530> fairly<00:01:22.799> happy<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
i've been fairly happy with that it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
i've been fairly happy with that it's
not<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> say<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> i<00:01:25.200> won't<00:01:25.470> investigate<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
not to say that i won't investigate this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
not to say that i won't investigate this
mode<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> could<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
mode and i think it could be kind of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
mode and i think it could be kind of
cool<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.890> obviously<00:01:29.119> batman<00:01:30.119> arkham<00:01:30.450> origins
