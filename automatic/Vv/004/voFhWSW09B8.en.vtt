loves and it can argue don't need to be
remade<00:02:58.569> but<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.650> looks<00:02:59.890> very<00:03:00.100> good<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.310> also

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
remade but this looks very good and also

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.160 
remade but this looks very good and also
the<00:03:00.850> special<00:03:01.150> effects<00:03:01.390> look<00:03:01.510> awesome<00:03:01.810> it

the special effects look awesome it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.780 
the special effects look awesome it
looks<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:02.410> they<00:03:02.500> spent<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.040> much<00:03:03.310> money<00:03:03.370> on

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
looks like they spent so much money on

this<00:03:03.940> movie<00:03:04.330> from<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> cast<00:03:05.560> great<00:03:05.980> cast

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
this movie from the cast great cast

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
this movie from the cast great cast
across<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.880> board<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.870> lot<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
across the board to really a lot of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.990 
across the board to really a lot of
special<00:03:08.440> effects<00:03:08.709> shots<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.280> hope<00:03:09.819> that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
special effects shots I hope that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.430 
special effects shots I hope that
they're<00:03:10.120> not<00:03:10.150> showing<00:03:10.600> us<00:03:10.720> everything<00:03:10.810> here

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
they're not showing us everything here

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.600 
they're not showing us everything here
but<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.799> doesn't<00:03:11.920> look<00:03:12.100> like<00:03:12.160> they<00:03:12.400> are<00:03:12.579> I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.130 
but it doesn't look like they are I
think<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> lot<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.049> this

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140
