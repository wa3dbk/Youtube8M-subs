00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
processor so I have a guitar going into

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.780 
processor so I have a guitar going into
my<00:00:28.199> interface<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.420> out<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:31.189> Ableton<00:00:32.189> I'm

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
my interface and out of Ableton I'm

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.459 
my interface and out of Ableton I'm
actually<00:00:33.600> routing<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.040> guitar

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
actually routing all the one guitar

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
actually routing all the one guitar
which<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
which is the one I to go from and the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
which is the one I to go from and the
out<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> two<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> my

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
out is going to one and two out of my

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.660 
out is going to one and two out of my
interface

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
interface

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.200 
interface
I<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> fire<00:00:45.809> pod<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.559> eight<00:00:46.980> outs<00:00:47.210> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
I have a fire pod that has eight outs so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.340 
I have a fire pod that has eight outs so
essentially<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.690> send<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> eight

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
essentially I can send it to eight

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
essentially I can send it to eight
different<00:00:49.739> places<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:50.340> sending<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
different places I'm sending it up to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.279 
different places I'm sending it up to
one<00:00:52.140> being<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:53.070> amp<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> fender<00:00:54.510> hot

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

one being one amp which is a fender hot
rod<00:00:55.500> ville<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.460> other<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.270> ash<00:00:57.420> down

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
rod ville and the other is an ash down

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.229 
rod ville and the other is an ash down
bass<00:00:57.899> amp<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:59.250> using<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.609> baritone<00:01:00.120> guitar

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so now we can apply effects to those

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
so now we can apply effects to those
channels<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.949> whatever<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.489> blah<00:01:05.790> blah
