00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.390
 sauvignon 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.960
 we start cooking the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.960
 potato cubes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 the potatoes in the pan to do 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 just a little water and rone just below 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.270
 is such a pinch of salt cover on the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270
 pan 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.510
 the eisbein that is a special piece 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 meat that is the heel of the pig and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 it is slowly cooked 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.299
 I'm going to pan the egg and just 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.130
 then in the oven and high heat 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.670
 then there must be a little bit of liquid 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670
 divide 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.570
 will take to the ice bar in lommel 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.800
 here the runaway meats quite on 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.450
 room temperature that is fine 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.940
 of course slightly less that the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 heat therethrough so penetrates the leg 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.800
 just a half hour in advance 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.800
 outside the refrigerator to pay 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:06.230
 so and then it goes in the oven for a while 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:13.220
 180 degrees 20 minutes the potatoes 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:16.010
 we have to let the cooking boil and then 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.650
 let's go get those potatoes on 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.040
 a dish 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.040
 we have such 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.890
 because then it cools down well for a while 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.090
 bit so divide a home made 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.950
 Potato salad 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.210
 that is nice we have 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.160
 potatoes already cooked 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.690
 to be called tomorrow cools 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.920
 nice bacon in we go the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 bake out 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.959
 and you are without butter because 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 there is enough fat in it 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.790
 then briefly on the fire and first 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 equally high heat in later goats one 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.080
 temper a bit and then it picks up nicely 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 crispy and we'll mix it nicely 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.290
 by that salad 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.660
 there we go the apples for a while 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 cut which I already peeled and have 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.830
 we do a trick for the first time 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.510
 cut slices and open those slices 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.510
 I put you on top of each other again 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:21.790
 we take the bowl and have a table 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.060
 message 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.140
 the bacon that are nice crispy 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.350
 baked out and we put that for a while 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.350
 away 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.300
 we leave it that way then we come with 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.850
 the cooled 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.850
 we don't do potatoes with the apple 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:48.100
 so then we go through it 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.010
 tasty fresh herbs with a sharp knife 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.660
 cut the chives then we have the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.310
 parsley 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:01.030
 we still have some celery leaves here 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:03.040
 and then we make and at double 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.900
 each other in that chive and those herbs 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.140
 they indicate a wonderful fresh taste 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.140
 the salad 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.200
 such he those herbs that go with this 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.470
 saladin 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.470
 so 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.180
 the bacon ones are already somewhat 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.780
 cooled down and has some fat on it 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 want to get 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.150
 a moment so I just go on 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.340
 create kitchen paper 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.479
 so little already fat because it assumes 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.479
 the well in the eye 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.370
 Dab this way it gets a little bit 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.220
 dry off 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.660
 just fine and i like him at the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.660
 potatoes and the salad 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.310
 now we are going to lay the salad we make 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.320
 First they marinate a generous and you it 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.620
 head bent spoons no do be 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.430
 of course with peppers from you we go 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.930
 just mix it in and always get rid of it 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.509
 scoop 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.820
 inwards and keep very nice salad 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.400
 and mix your ingredient well 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.289
 the white coleslaw we have from rushes 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.930
 a delicious cabbage salad that you must 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.600
 first drain for a moment so call that 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.530
 for a moment so that moisture got off 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.530
 and that code out 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.449
 I 'm going to express so that there already 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:38.000
 the moisture driving it is in this way so then 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.580
 we put that co on the board 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.460
 and then I will continue to mix that with 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.830
 raisins and those raisins that have 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.919
 we first violence in hot water 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.599
 about half an hour through 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.250
 and mix in the white cabbage that is 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.060

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.979
 White cabbage 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.050

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.520
 so we put it right in the middle 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.810
 this must go to the heart of the old 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:27.050
