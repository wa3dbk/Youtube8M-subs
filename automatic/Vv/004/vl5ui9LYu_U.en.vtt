Welcome from AC News,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's see today's trailer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cinema news is coming up!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Walt Disney Pictures has produced the new adventure movie John Carter,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which will be out in theatres the 9rd of May 2012.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The movie has been adapted by director Andrew Stanton

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
from the novel by Edgar Rise Burroughs.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Taylor Kitsch is in for the lead role.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The movie looks really epic because they're outstanding visuals

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that you can see have been worked on in detail.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But maybe the plot has no substance.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Although Stanton worked at first with Pixar

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
where the plot always counts more than anything else,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so we'll have to wait for the release date to judge.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The Nutcracker will be adapted by Adam Shankman,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the director of Bedtime Stories.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It seems like this story like Christmas Carol by Dickens

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
needs to be revised forever.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We saw movies, cartoons, plays.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The script will be Darren Lemke (Shrek Forever After) to write it,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and they say it will go back to it's original roots of the plot,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to 1816 version The Nutcracker and the Mouse of the King by E.T.A.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It will be a more like version of Alice in Wonderland,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which concentrates on adventure and romanticism.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That's all for today,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
see you soon from AC News!
