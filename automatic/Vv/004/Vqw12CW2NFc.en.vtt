00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.959
 health friends with you elmer from not want 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.600
 talk to you about a problem with which 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.780
 surely each of you encountered this 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
 problem with lack of RAM 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.620
 Personally, I myself relatively recently with such 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.030
 RAM problem I had encountered 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.279
 only 50 megabytes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 the shell rebooted all the games you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 flew and the phone was but just 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 it's impossible to work right away for me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 shocked because here like 2 days 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 back everything was fine and now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 the phone began in an unimaginable way 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 lag well I actually started to understand 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 what's the problem the problem lies here 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 thatâ€™s all these apps 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 You have exactly navi and some 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.579
 standard like google maps climb background 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.230
 that is, without our knowledge open 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 checks its update and yet 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 if you think that 's all applications 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 for example, which I have now 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.129
 fixed actions all at once 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.020
 will open start checking all 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.829
 I have a phone application 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 just zaglyuchit personally I think so 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.719
 that's why we need to decide somehow 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 this problem and the best example is the same 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.760
 option all reset the devils to the initial 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.229
 setting this also does not help early or 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.210
 later we will install the application which 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.860
 we need them too will climb out 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 The phone will also lag, therefore, this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.220
 the problem is somehow solved very 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.210
 naturally a program called 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 greenify 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.549
 what does she do firstly she lulls 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.909
 all these applications and they will not be able to eat 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.829
 background but there is a very interesting feature 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 She does not remove these applications from the shell 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.409
 that is, there are those who reported and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 they are also put to sleep 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.240
 who are even there are those who 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 remove them from the phone ie the phone 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 I think that they are deleted but in fact 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 They are on the phone and the games will be 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.450
 run only through the program but 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.460
 the screen is not right in the first place with their 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 the sleep program does not disappear 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.939
 secondly they will not need 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.939
 activate ie you for example i'm 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.649
 degrees started the game played outside and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.140
 then the words put to sleep here that is all 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.619
 very simple let me show you how it is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.799
 works 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.360
 let's go greenify and let's start 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.399
 here's the screen you will have initial 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 screen click on master settings 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.539
 settings greenify 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.009
 show other applications and here you have 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.800
 the list of all these applications will drop 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.660
 which you yourself have installed i have 4 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 I continue them without putting them to sleep 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 reasons it is not necessary but there are 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.750
 games that I put down the game application and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.739
 none of this background climbs like 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.769
 written sleeping 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:34.650
 they all sleep with us so here is the master 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.250
 settings greenify you click on 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.620
 program 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.720
 now i will show it here is an example here 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.590
 if you choose all programs as usual 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.830
 tapom and click check whether what is at 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.690
 you 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.799
 applications clings then you again 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.280
 go into settings and create title and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.349
 girl and hibernation oh well then you have 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.019
 There is such a flower on the cover 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.060
 give it up on my stomach now 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.260
 no then we are waiting for u clutch my all 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.000
 I'll show you how it works 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.280
 For example, let's go to true skate and a little bit to 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.340
 his play all I can hardly 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.230
 it will turn out I will be finished 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.310
 so well let's say we play it 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.780
 and he now works with us . 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.780
 you need to do now you just need to click 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.730
 on the label put to sleep and everything from the Russian asleep 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 follow mode does not look like if we 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.580
 somehow we won't open it well what is it all 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.930
 what I want to tell them about greenify this 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.879
 don't make me pay 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.799
 the subject will still be a few parts on 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.269
 other programs i think if 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.549
 combine all these programs 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.140
 then the phone the brain will just fly well 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.519
 well everybody thanks for watching everyone 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.519
 good luck everyone bye
