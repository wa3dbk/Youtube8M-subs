00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.939 
easier I'll show you what this little
ramp<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:19.940> towards<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> end<00:04:20.510> like<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.680> said<00:04:21.859> is

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
ramp it's towards the end like I said is

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.320 
ramp it's towards the end like I said is
the<00:04:22.010> first<00:04:22.220> time<00:04:22.400> doing<00:04:22.729> this<00:04:22.760> instance<00:04:23.180> of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
the first time doing this instance of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.240 
the first time doing this instance of
learning<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:23.900> now<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.500> learned<00:04:24.919> how<00:04:25.039> to<00:04:25.130> do

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
learning and now I learned how to do

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.700 
learning and now I learned how to do
this<00:04:25.400> instance<00:04:25.820> very<00:04:26.060> well<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:27.320> could<00:04:27.470> be<00:04:27.500> done

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
this instance very well it could be done

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.029 
this instance very well it could be done
really<00:04:27.919> easy

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
really easy

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.820 
really easy
so<00:04:31.039> you'll<00:04:31.729> see<00:04:31.910> right<00:04:32.090> there<00:04:32.560> it's<00:04:33.560> not<00:04:33.800> a

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
so you'll see right there it's not a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.850 
so you'll see right there it's not a
favorite<00:04:34.340> instance<00:04:34.820> these<00:04:34.940> little<00:04:35.660> guys<00:04:35.860> they

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
favorite instance these little guys they

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
may be non elites but they're like 68

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.140 
may be non elites but they're like 68
