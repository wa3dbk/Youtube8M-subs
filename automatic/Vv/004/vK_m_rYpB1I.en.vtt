00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920 
pretty car like in quite nice to drive
but<00:01:58.580> once<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.910> get<00:01:59.030> out<00:01:59.180> in<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> open<00:01:59.540> or

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
but once you get out in the open or

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.420 
but once you get out in the open or
you're<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.229> motorway<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.010> different

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
you're on the motorway it's a different

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.730 
you're on the motorway it's a different
story<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:02.330> pretty<00:02:02.660> noisy<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.350> lot<00:02:03.560> less

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
story it's pretty noisy and a lot less

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.710 
story it's pretty noisy and a lot less
stable<00:02:04.070> but<00:02:04.729> let's<00:02:04.910> not<00:02:05.060> forget<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.660> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
stable but let's not forget that this is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.169 
stable but let's not forget that this is
a<00:02:05.869> four<00:02:06.200> by<00:02:06.380> four<00:02:06.410> at<00:02:06.830> half<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.640> don't<00:02:08.060> be

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
a four by four at half so don't be

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.880 
a four by four at half so don't be
fooled<00:02:08.420> by<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.750> more<00:02:08.929> subtle<00:02:09.140> on-road<00:02:09.560> looks

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
fooled by it's more subtle on-road looks

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.860 
fooled by it's more subtle on-road looks
now<00:02:10.700> as<00:02:10.820> with<00:02:10.940> most<00:02:11.090> four-wheel<00:02:11.570> drives

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
now as with most four-wheel drives

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.570 
now as with most four-wheel drives
nowadays<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.500> transmission<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.160> switchable

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
nowadays the transmission is switchable

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.880 
nowadays the transmission is switchable
from<00:02:13.880> two<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.239> four<00:02:14.420> wheel<00:02:14.600> drive<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.709> can

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
from two to four wheel drive so it can

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
from two to four wheel drive so it can
spend<00:02:16.160> most<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.489> his<00:02:16.610> time<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.060> two-wheel

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
spend most of his time in two-wheel

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.300 
spend most of his time in two-wheel
drive<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.959> save<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> little<00:02:18.440> tiny<00:02:18.830> bit<00:02:19.100> on

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
gearstick can hum brake lever when I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.490 
gearstick can hum brake lever when I
know<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.360> are<00:03:14.450> some<00:03:14.690> big<00:03:14.810> Americans<00:03:15.349> out
