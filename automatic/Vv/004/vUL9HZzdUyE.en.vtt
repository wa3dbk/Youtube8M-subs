know<00:04:01.170> what<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.410> thing<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.650> actually<00:04:01.860> pretty

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
know what this thing is actually pretty

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.820 
know what this thing is actually pretty
good<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:03.150> normally<00:04:04.020> never<00:04:04.140> use<00:04:04.410> Marshall

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
good I normally never use Marshall

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.100 
good I normally never use Marshall
rifles<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.370> someone<00:04:05.670> asked<00:04:05.970> me<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.660> I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
rifles but someone asked me to and I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.450 
rifles but someone asked me to and I
thought<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> could<00:04:07.650> combine<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.310> this

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
thought I could combine it to this

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.150 
thought I could combine it to this
because<00:04:08.610> well<00:04:08.880> with<00:04:09.000> these<00:04:09.150> gun<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.890> need<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
because well with these gun you need to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.240 
because well with these gun you need to
be<00:04:11.280> super<00:04:11.700> accurate<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.680> want<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
be super accurate if you want this to

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.000 
be super accurate if you want this to
work<00:04:14.280> out<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.380> sense<00:04:16.620> one

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
work out so in that sense one

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.539 
work out so in that sense one
sensitivity<00:04:17.640> make<00:04:18.060> sense<00:04:19.130> whatever<00:04:20.130> ID<00:04:20.340> how

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
sensitivity make sense whatever ID how

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.770 
sensitivity make sense whatever ID how
you<00:04:20.610> doing<00:04:20.910> I'm<00:04:21.660> kind<00:04:22.170> of<00:04:22.230> very<00:04:22.470> low<00:04:22.710> on<00:04:22.860> ammo

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
you doing I'm kind of very low on ammo
