black and I know the second call is

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.490 
black and I know the second call is
wrong<00:01:40.630> because<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.930> should<00:01:41.079> actually<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.470> a

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I've gone for the second color as a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.810 
I've gone for the second color as a
classic<00:01:45.820> ultra<00:01:46.479> balloon<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.430> up<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.640> you

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
whether you keep that on there or not

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.899
