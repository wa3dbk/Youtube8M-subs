hack<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> shit<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.510> saw<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.660> saw<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
hack and shit but I saw I saw this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
hack and shit but I saw I saw this
picture<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.890> thought<00:00:44.070> it'd<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.219> pretty

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
picture and I thought it'd be pretty

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.080 
picture and I thought it'd be pretty
cool<00:00:44.960> easy<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.440> 36<00:00:46.890> layers<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.879> turns

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
cool easy to do with 36 layers it turns

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
cool easy to do with 36 layers it turns
out<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.719> difficult<00:00:49.079> than<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> thought

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
out it's more difficult than I thought

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.250 
out it's more difficult than I thought
ended<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.370> using<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.910> 36<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:51.989> alright

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
ended up using all 36 but that's alright

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.569 
ended up using all 36 but that's alright
because<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> usually<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.190> anyway

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because that's what I usually do anyway

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.500 
because that's what I usually do anyway
so<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:54.270> start<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.629> advisor<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:56.090> using<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so your start with advisor here using a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
so your start with advisor here using a
what's<00:00:57.989> called<00:00:58.079> trapezoid<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
what's called trapezoid and then a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
what's called trapezoid and then a
couple<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.090> triangles<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> couple<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
couple of triangles and then a couple of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.490 
couple of triangles and then a couple of
these<00:01:01.770> curved<00:01:02.699> square<00:01:03.510> looking<00:01:04.229> things

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
these curved square looking things

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
these curved square looking things
stretch<00:01:05.159> those<00:01:05.339> puppies<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.090> another

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
stretch those puppies out get another

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.179 
stretch those puppies out get another
trapezoid<00:01:07.760> for<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> top<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> visor<00:01:09.360> here

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
trapezoid for the top of the visor here

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
trapezoid for the top of the visor here
and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> believe<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.530> feel<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and then and then I believe I feel that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
and then and then I believe I feel that
the<00:01:14.610> angle<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.450> quite<00:01:15.750> right<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.200> just

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the angle is not quite right so I'm just

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
the angle is not quite right so I'm just
gonna<00:01:16.409> raise<00:01:16.860> them<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.090> bit

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
gonna raise them up here a little bit

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.340 
gonna raise them up here a little bit
and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.409> adjust<00:01:20.100> accordingly<00:01:21.229> doesn't<00:01:22.229> have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and then adjust accordingly doesn't have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
and then adjust accordingly doesn't have
to<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.590> perfect<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.150> spend<00:01:24.630> so

need it to be so we'll add a couple more

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.219 
need it to be so we'll add a couple more
layers<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.930> get<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:57.229> shape

fly this isn't like an emblem that I've

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.900 
fly this isn't like an emblem that I've
already<00:04:13.200> created<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.980> I'm<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.190> redoing<00:04:14.670> it

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
already created and I'm just redoing it

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.199 
already created and I'm just redoing it
real<00:04:15.240> quick<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.530> me<00:04:16.709> making<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.820> real

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
real quick this is me making it in real

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.130 
real quick this is me making it in real
time<00:04:18.239> obviously<00:04:18.810> I'm<00:04:19.410> speeding<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.920> up<00:04:20.010> quite

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
time obviously I'm speeding it up quite

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.760 
time obviously I'm speeding it up quite
accelerated<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:23.570> nevertheless<00:04:24.570> all<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
accelerated but nevertheless all the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.030 
accelerated but nevertheless all the
mistakes<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.490> make

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
mistakes that I make

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.610 
mistakes that I make
happen<00:04:27.450> here<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.660> I'll<00:04:29.200> leave<00:04:29.380> some<00:04:29.560> things

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
happen here and I'll leave some things

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.940 
happen here and I'll leave some things
in<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.070> cutting<00:04:30.310> room<00:04:30.340> floor<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:31.890> this<00:04:32.890> is

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
in the cutting room floor and this is

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.070 
in the cutting room floor and this is
like<00:04:33.340> my<00:04:33.490> fourth<00:04:33.550> try<00:04:34.180> at<00:04:34.510> an<00:04:34.630> emblem<00:04:34.930> there's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
like my fourth try at an emblem there's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.410 
like my fourth try at an emblem there's
a<00:04:35.170> couple<00:04:35.410> others<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:35.920> I'd<00:04:36.010> wanted<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.760> try

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
a couple others that I'd wanted to try

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.320 
a couple others that I'd wanted to try
to<00:04:37.480> do<00:04:37.890> for<00:04:38.890> this<00:04:39.010> week's<00:04:39.280> episode<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:40.030> just

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
to do for this week's episode that just

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.300 
to do for this week's episode that just
they<00:04:40.720> weren't<00:04:41.020> possible<00:04:41.320> with<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
they weren't possible with the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.830 
they weren't possible with the
eliminated<00:04:42.760> mal<00:04:42.910> layers<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.420> we<00:04:43.480> had<00:04:43.630> and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
eliminated mal layers that we had and

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.870 
eliminated mal layers that we had and
this<00:04:43.930> was<00:04:44.080> actually<00:04:44.230> my<00:04:44.500> second<00:04:45.040> try<00:04:45.520> out<00:04:45.580> some

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
this was actually my second try out some

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.220 
this was actually my second try out some
as<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.140> for<00:04:47.620> Santa's<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.910> first<00:04:49.390> time<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:50.020> just

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
as the for Santa's the first time I just

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.920 
as the for Santa's the first time I just
I<00:04:50.410> used<00:04:51.130> way<00:04:51.340> too<00:04:51.400> many<00:04:51.700> layers<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.600> visor

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
I used way too many layers in the visor

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.830 
I used way too many layers in the visor
and<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.500> wasn't<00:04:53.860> able<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.100> get<00:04:54.400> these<00:04:54.840> detailed

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and I wasn't able to get these detailed

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.610 
and I wasn't able to get these detailed
portions<00:04:56.590> done<00:04:57.870> correctly<00:04:58.870> finished<00:04:59.470> those

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
portions done correctly finished those

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.330 
portions done correctly finished those
up<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.550> after<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.440> finagling<00:05:02.440> with<00:05:02.500> with<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
up so after a finagling with with the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.250 
up so after a finagling with with the
layers<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.880> little<00:05:04.150> bit<00:05:04.300> more<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.110> the

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
layers just a little bit more of the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.660 
layers just a little bit more of the
shapes<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.650> found<00:05:05.890> out<00:05:06.010> some<00:05:06.280> shapes<00:05:06.460> were

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
shapes that found out some shapes were

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.850 
shapes that found out some shapes were
better<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.120> help<00:05:07.240> me<00:05:07.360> save<00:05:07.630> some<00:05:07.900> layers<00:05:08.170> to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
better that help me save some layers to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.220 
better that help me save some layers to
to<00:05:09.400> get<00:05:09.580> just<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.060> amount<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.540> needed<00:05:10.870> and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
to get just the amount that I needed and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.960 
to get just the amount that I needed and
did<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:12.420> using<00:05:13.420> all<00:05:15.570> 32<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.530> layers

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
did that using all 32 of the layers

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.520 
did that using all 32 of the layers
needed<00:05:18.970> needed<00:05:19.360> them<00:05:19.540> all<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:20.200> try<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:20.440> get

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
needed needed them all to try and get

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.930 
needed needed them all to try and get
this<00:05:20.620> curved<00:05:20.860> line<00:05:20.890> here<00:05:21.340> for<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.610> last

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
this curved line here for the last

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.490 
this curved line here for the last
portion<00:05:22.300> base<00:05:22.600> but<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:22.960> just<00:05:23.200> want<00:05:23.410> to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
portion base but you just want to

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.760 
portion base but you just want to
connect<00:05:23.860> these<00:05:24.160> these<00:05:25.030> three<00:05:25.480> lines<00:05:26.080> on<00:05:26.470> the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
connect these these three lines on the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.280 
connect these these three lines on the
left<00:05:26.800> side<00:05:27.310> ideally<00:05:28.060> they<00:05:28.210> don't<00:05:28.360> perfectly

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
left side ideally they don't perfectly

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.890 
left side ideally they don't perfectly
connect<00:05:29.620> but<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:30.340> still<00:05:30.790> looks<00:05:31.030> fine<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.780> guys

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
connect but it still looks fine you guys

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.620 
connect but it still looks fine you guys
get<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.320> idea<00:05:32.770> it's<00:05:33.580> nice<00:05:33.760> it's<00:05:34.060> simplistic

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
get the idea it's nice it's simplistic

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.200 
get the idea it's nice it's simplistic
you<00:05:35.200> know<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.920> it's<00:05:36.100> Samish<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:36.910> wish<00:05:37.090> I

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
you know that it's Samish and I wish I

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.990 
you know that it's Samish and I wish I
make<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.570> title<00:05:37.900> that<00:05:38.400> works<00:05:39.400> well<00:05:39.640> with<00:05:39.790> this

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
make a title that works well with this

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.970 
make a title that works well with this
so<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.540> went<00:05:40.870> ahead<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.200> used<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.500> overkill

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
so I went ahead and used the overkill

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.530 
so I went ahead and used the overkill
once<00:05:42.220> that<00:05:42.520> dudes<00:05:42.760> at<00:05:42.910> a<00:05:42.940> bunch<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.210> are<00:05:43.360> more
