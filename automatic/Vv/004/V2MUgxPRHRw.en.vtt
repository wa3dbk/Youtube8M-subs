00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.130 
plates chase but i think is gonna be a
little<00:00:45.270> different<00:00:45.539> than<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> other<00:00:45.960> one

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
little different than the other one

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
little different than the other one
because<00:00:46.260> i<00:00:46.379> think<00:00:46.469> i'm<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.670> sure<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
because i think i'm not sure if you just
survive<00:00:48.800> like<00:00:49.800> me<00:00:50.039> break<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.250> trees<00:00:50.700> and
