so<00:05:07.780> basic<00:05:08.470> facts<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.920> knife<00:05:09.100> it's<00:05:12.030> part<00:05:13.030> of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
so basic facts of the knife it's part of

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.020 
so basic facts of the knife it's part of
the<00:05:13.150> fringe<00:05:13.420> negative<00:05:14.170> carbon<00:05:14.380> fiber<00:05:15.030> it's

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
the fringe negative carbon fiber it's

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:25.220 
the fringe negative carbon fiber it's
right<00:05:16.180> here<00:05:16.350> this<00:05:17.350> part<00:05:19.230> it's<00:05:20.700> mostly<00:05:22.980> closely
