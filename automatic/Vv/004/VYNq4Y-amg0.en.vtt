00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Tools and SiO hotter when the players started the new year very lively early departure 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 It is our Kim Yu-na Suns 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.139
 Deciding on the final program on their last domestic stage, a perfect performance 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:21.240
 It is the first time in the women's singles career that it unfolds and returns 80 points for the first time 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.949
 It was the best act of the night. Yes, it is. Send the short program clown.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.570
 I got a total of 80 points and 60 points. 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 When I won the Olympic gold medal in Vancouver four years ago, I scored 78.5 . 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 It's the best record ever. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.250
 Zest also the unofficial world record for the tournament because of domestic competition unofficial record 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 But I am very confident ahead of the Sochi Olympic Games. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 Yes. 4 What more do you need to say? 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.730
 Let's enjoy the perfect performance again . 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.650
 Send me a clown. 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.430
 Oh, the real sound is alive. 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.430
 Actor becomes actor 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.500
 There's more. 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.590
 Yeah, it's so neat. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 I'm thinking it's not ice. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 U 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040

 Oh inde double axel that mistake once 4g perfect time jjyon 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.470
 I think it was a problem that did not require words. 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.260
 w 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.160
 Well, I think you're seeing it in your breath. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.160
 I think I'm just thinking about the immersion. 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.000
 The finish of a movie or a sound drops 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970
 U 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.640
 Oh jumps, but expressions are really rich here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.730
 U 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.040
 Orr's last love 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.950
 It just comes out already. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.080
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:09.240

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:14.010
 Now the word line 80 Oh Yes 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.549
 The fact that all of us, without real words , 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.770
 I guess what I already have is the men might be really surprised to see their score 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.700
 I was surprised. If you do this in Sochi, there will not be any problems with your living room. 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.050
 The Fourth International Conference Yuna Kim had a plan since the last egg foot injury 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:36.060
 I was not able to play, so after last year's Zagreb, 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:40.260
 The overall championship was the final stage of any rehearsal for the Sochi Olympic Games. 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.640
 I am sure that I will be able to show my best performance, 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.840
 I recommend it. 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.919
 In addition, the active player Ross always shows the last stage in Korea 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.970
 Because of the situation 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.850
 I think it will be very meaningful for me personally 4 Kim Yu-na 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.690
 In the afternoon , I play free programs. 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.740
