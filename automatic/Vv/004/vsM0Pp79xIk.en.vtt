so<00:00:31.320> let's<00:00:31.470> look<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> how<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.099> them<00:00:32.279> even

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so let's look at how to make them even

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.420 
so let's look at how to make them even
faster<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.500> in<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> previous<00:00:34.710> tutorial<00:00:34.860> I

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.620 
the same shortcut all of the lasso tools
you<00:03:42.310> can<00:03:42.459> press<00:03:42.640> L<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.030> get<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.300> lasso<00:03:43.600> tool

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
you can press L to get to the lasso tool

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.509 
you can press L to get to the lasso tool
and<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.260> way<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.590> do<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.160> you

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
and the way that you do this is you

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.640 
and the way that you do this is you
press<00:03:45.790> l<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.330> then<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.750> get<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.019> cycle<00:03:47.620> through

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
press l and then to get to cycle through

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.150 
press l and then to get to cycle through
to<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.980> next<00:03:48.100> tool<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.550> press<00:03:48.790> shift<00:03:49.090> l<00:03:50.160> now

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
to the next tool you press shift l now

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.670 
to the next tool you press shift l now
some<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.030> these<00:03:52.120> tools<00:03:52.390> you're<00:03:53.290> not<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.620> to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
some of these tools you're not going to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.410 
some of these tools you're not going to
use<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:54.130> if<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.370> cycle<00:03:54.640> through<00:03:54.820> let's<00:03:55.300> say

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
use so if you cycle through let's say

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.090 
use so if you cycle through let's say
for<00:03:55.600> example<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:57.239> lasso<00:03:58.239> tools<00:03:58.510> i<00:03:59.100> don't

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
for example the lasso tools i don't

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.740 
for example the lasso tools i don't
really<00:04:00.250> ever<00:04:00.489> use<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.970> magnetic<00:04:01.239> lasso<00:04:01.540> tool

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
really ever use the magnetic lasso tool

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.140 
really ever use the magnetic lasso tool
so<00:04:02.320> i<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.590> clear<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:02.920> out<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.370> now<00:04:03.880> when<00:04:04.120> I

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
so i can clear that out and now when I

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.630 
so i can clear that out and now when I
cycle<00:04:04.600> through<00:04:04.810> if<00:04:05.019> I'm<00:04:05.620> hitting<00:04:05.800> shift<00:04:06.160> L<00:04:06.370> all

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
cycle through if I'm hitting shift L all

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.490 
cycle through if I'm hitting shift L all
I<00:04:06.700> have<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.940> do<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.180> hit<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.390> twice<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.350> can

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
I have to do is hit it twice and I can

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.780 
I have to do is hit it twice and I can
go<00:04:08.590> back<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.800> forth<00:04:09.070> between<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.459> last<00:04:09.640> on

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
go back and forth between the last on

a<00:04:11.950> little<00:04:12.070> bit<00:04:12.190> more<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:13.230> don't<00:04:14.230> use<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.470> color

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
a little bit more I don't use the color

in a while if we accept this and then we

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.220 
in a while if we accept this and then we
hit<00:04:25.210> OK

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
hit OK

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.510 
hit OK
you'll<00:04:26.320> find<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.590> we<00:04:26.710> need<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.920> drop<00:04:27.040> down<00:04:27.280> in

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
you'll find that we need to drop down in

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
this any of the keyboard shortcuts that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.960 
this any of the keyboard shortcuts that
you're<00:04:47.230> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.410> use<00:04:47.500> frequently<00:04:47.920> put<00:04:48.790> them

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
you're going to use frequently put them

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.430 
you're going to use frequently put them
close<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.600> your<00:04:49.720> hand<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.230> have<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
close to your hand so you don't have to

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.990 
close to your hand so you don't have to
stretch<00:04:50.650> across<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.950> keyboard<00:04:51.250> or<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:51.940> you

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
stretch across the keyboard or so you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.610 
stretch across the keyboard or so you
don't<00:04:52.150> have<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.360> do<00:04:52.480> some<00:04:52.750> crazy<00:04:52.960> for<00:04:53.320> button

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620
