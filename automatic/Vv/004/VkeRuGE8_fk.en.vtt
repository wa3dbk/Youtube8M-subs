these devices what many people don't
realize<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> these<00:01:10.890> devices<00:01:11.100> emit

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
realize is that these devices emit

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
realize is that these devices emit
radiation<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:12.780> gone<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.380> talk

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
radiation which I've gone on to talk

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.130 
radiation which I've gone on to talk
about<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> blog<00:01:14.580> below<00:01:16.430> at<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.700> point

regarding electromagnetic frequencies

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.740 
regarding electromagnetic frequencies
EMFs<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.619> valid<00:01:23.159> solid<00:01:24.000> research<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
EMFs we have valid solid research that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
EMFs we have valid solid research that
shows<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:26.159> things<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.790> harmful

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
shows that these things can be harmful

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.499 
shows that these things can be harmful
especially<00:01:28.490> over<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> period<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.240> time

especially over a period of time

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.980 
especially over a period of time
sometimes<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:31.979> 10<00:01:32.250> 15<00:01:32.759> 20<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.420> 30

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sometimes these take 10 15 20 and 30

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
sometimes these take 10 15 20 and 30
years<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.829> manifest<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> can
