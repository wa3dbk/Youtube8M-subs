video on how to replace the stock
headlights<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.480> never<00:00:16.020> got<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.289> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
headlights but I never got around to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.240 
headlights but I never got around to
doing<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.890> while<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:20.100> I'll

doing that while I was doing it so I'll

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
doing that while I was doing it so I'll
just<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> show<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> try<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> explain

just have to show you and try to explain

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
just have to show you and try to explain
how<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> did<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.539> very<00:00:24.900> simple<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.439> how

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
how I did it but it's very simple on how

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.370 
how I did it but it's very simple on how
to<00:00:25.650> replace<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.279> four<00:00:26.750> LEDs<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.140> look

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to replace these four LEDs and they look

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.359 
to replace these four LEDs and they look
really<00:00:28.619> nice<00:00:29.060> basically<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
really nice basically there is a

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
really nice basically there is a
connector<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.820> behind<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
connector back behind there and if you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.940 
connector back behind there and if you
just<00:00:35.219> take<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.989> turn<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:39.410> turn<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
just take it and turn it turn it that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
just take it and turn it turn it that
way<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.170> it'll<00:00:43.440> click<00:00:43.770> out<00:00:44.120> allowing<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
way and it'll click out allowing you to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
way and it'll click out allowing you to
to<00:00:45.719> pull<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.649> piece<00:00:49.950> here

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to pull it out and then this piece here

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
to pull it out and then this piece here
just<00:00:50.579> pops<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.559> pull<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
just pops right out you just pull it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
just pops right out you just pull it
straight<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.480> these<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> nine<00:00:55.530> SMD<00:00:56.250> super

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
straight out these are a nine SMD super

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.410 
straight out these are a nine SMD super
white<00:00:57.890> LEDs<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.190> you'll<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
white LEDs and you'll see here in a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.009 
white LEDs and you'll see here in a
second<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:02.239> I'm<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> slide<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.870> back

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
second but I'm going to slide that back

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.620 
second but I'm going to slide that back
in<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:10.970> then<00:01:11.970> once<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
in this lot and then once that's all the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.630 
in this lot and then once that's all the
way<00:01:12.720> through<00:01:13.939> you'll<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.119> ahead<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.360> just

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
way through you'll go ahead and just

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
way through you'll go ahead and just
twist<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.750> towards<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:22.520> again<00:01:23.520> I'll<00:01:23.850> get

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
twist it back towards you again I'll get

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
twist it back towards you again I'll get
some<00:01:24.180> night<00:01:24.360> shots<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.560> I'll<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.979> turn

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
some night shots here but I'll just turn

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.550 
some night shots here but I'll just turn
them<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.470> they

replace

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.910 

I<00:02:07.930> know<00:02:08.930> it's<00:02:09.140> hard<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.320> tell<00:02:09.500> here<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
I know it's hard to tell here in the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.450 
I know it's hard to tell here in the
daylight<00:02:10.220> how<00:02:11.030> bright<00:02:11.300> they<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:12.250> I'll<00:02:13.250> go

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
daylight how bright they are but I'll go

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.940 
daylight how bright they are but I'll go
ahead<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.730> make<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> video<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.020> add<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.710> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
ahead and make a video and add on it to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.090 
ahead and make a video and add on it to
it<00:02:16.040> at<00:02:16.130> night<00:02:17.620> okay<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.740> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.040> ahead

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
it at night okay I'm going to go ahead

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.150 
it at night okay I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:19.280> demonstrate<00:02:19.430> my<00:02:20.290> alligator<00:02:21.290> headlights

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
and demonstrate my alligator headlights

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.460 
and demonstrate my alligator headlights
and<00:02:22.490> actual<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.450> real<00:02:23.480> headlights<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
and actual the real headlights so you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.180 
and actual the real headlights so you
can<00:02:27.620> see<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> inside<00:02:28.340> they're<00:02:28.550> my<00:02:28.700> LEDs

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
can see in the inside they're my LEDs

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.760 
can see in the inside they're my LEDs
like<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> headlamp<00:02:31.730> overhead<00:02:32.720> light<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
like the headlamp overhead light it

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.590 
like the headlamp overhead light it
makes<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.610> whole<00:02:34.760> inside<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> lot<00:02:35.360> brighter

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
makes the whole inside a lot brighter

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.140 
makes the whole inside a lot brighter
it's<00:02:36.110> hard<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.380> tell<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.680> video<00:02:36.770> but<00:02:37.150> it's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
it's hard to tell in the video but it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.400 
it's hard to tell in the video but it's
a<00:02:38.210> lot<00:02:38.360> brighter<00:02:38.450> than<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> normal

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
a lot brighter than what the normal

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.010 
a lot brighter than what the normal
bulbs<00:02:39.740> are<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.750> these<00:02:41.750> are<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
bulbs are so these are just the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.840 
bulbs are so these are just the
alligator<00:02:45.020> front<00:02:45.590> portions<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.580> as<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.730> can

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
alligator front portions and as you can

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:59.520 
alligator front portions and as you can
