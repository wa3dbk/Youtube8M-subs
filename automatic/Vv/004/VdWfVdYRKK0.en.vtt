00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello everyone the style you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.900
 okay today I will vote for 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 a tutorial a bit special since 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.950
 it's a tutorial with a answer that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.740
 I realized myself so I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.180
 inspired by the model of the hair clip 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.750
 that I excelled in the video on the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 2002 to realize the time and in fact 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 I do them for Pauline's blog 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 hair of us so he went color 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 green and violet since 200 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 favorite colors 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.989
 and she does not know at all what this is 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.410
 I'm just going to ask for his colors 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.969
 favorite 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.700
 and she knows that there are pearls and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 that's all so I 'm going right after 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 have filmed this video I will send him 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 and she will be able to discover it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.780
 finally because I can no longer keep 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 the secret is too old so it's 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 left for the tutorial as usual 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 you do not bust your hair one starts to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.610
 speak tip 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.330
 so that's once you have 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:19.430
 finished hair trial we're going 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:24.310
 delimit of selection one that goes from the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.310
 tend to the back of the left ear 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 and can be left as it is attached 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.890
 with a thought as you prefer 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.290
 and then we'll do the same thing 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.570
 next to me I'm going to laugh a little on 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.830
 the left so I count match all this 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.520
 but you can do very well 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.210
 the reverse is brought to be fixed so as 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.880
 so good corner we look 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 especially t / day dhr on 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 take the lead and I will place it 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.460
 like this so roughly at the level of 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.390
 demand is now with the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 hair that remained free to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.690
 the back come to attach them glues 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.950
 and putties do not need to do 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.740
 a lot of tricks to say no it's 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 really just for a few seconds 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.820
 places and the headband on that side 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 and so we just have to pass the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:34.130
 hair like those here and there lighthouses 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.870
 elastic and they possessed making of 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.260
 pretty heads duvet any damage on the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.940
 rope 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.209
 I loved his style so it is 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.750
 the cow and the wick from the front we have 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.340
 secure it to the back of the head 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.340
 to be precise 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.660
 do not hesitate to brush your hair 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.670
 the back so like me you do not like 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.670
 we see your scalp 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.730
 so with the other wick same principle 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.510
 know next to them 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.970
 so I'll take you back to the side game 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.170
 left and you make a braid all 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.170
 simple to big three 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.370
 they do not manufacture well secured with a 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.410
 elastic 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.569
 so it's not necessary for it to be 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.190
 transparent as the spikes will be 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:19.280
 task is so now little of us 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.760
 pull on the braid to help him but a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.760
 little products 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:39.570
 so here and so we will come 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.140
 the rolled up while letting go 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.140
 inside 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.790
 so you can use tongs 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.360
 Tea tongs union one 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.100
 you prefer 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.600
 here today I was spending 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.100
 flat but it works also very well 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.580
 with china tongs see that my 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.580
 little last 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.500
 There you go 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.319
 so I put little baby hair that 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.319
 is done a little bit 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.960
 6 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.440
 but well that's what it gives so I 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.530
 you answer I will lose because I 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:59.630
 I'm too proud of myself and so you have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.630

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.319
 so here's the title nothing is finished 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.830
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.089
 it's really very easy to do like 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.319
 you see it's just a year the banks 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:18.180
 and it's still very chic 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.219
 so I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.599
