okay<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.240> for<00:01:00.240> this<00:01:00.300> riff<00:01:00.540> I'm<00:01:00.990> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> using

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
okay so for this riff I'm going to using

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.140 
okay so for this riff I'm going to using
all<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:02.070> picks<00:01:02.310> so<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> won't<00:01:02.820> better<00:01:02.970> see

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
all down picks so you won't better see

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.720 
all down picks so you won't better see
my<00:01:03.270> right<00:01:03.450> now<00:01:03.630> here<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.550> down

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
my right now here but it will be down

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.560 
my right now here but it will be down
picks<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.970> bit<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.120> palm<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
picks and a little bit bit of a palm you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.470 
picks and a little bit bit of a palm you
that's<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.870> chugging<00:01:11.150> chugging<00:01:12.150> sound

that's all that chugging chugging sound

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.610 
that's all that chugging chugging sound
so<00:01:12.690> we're<00:01:12.810> losing<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.410> palm

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
so we're losing a little bit of a palm

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.250 
so we're losing a little bit of a palm
mute<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.980> all<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.640> picks<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.020> first

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
mute and all down picks so the first

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.250 
mute and all down picks so the first
part<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:18.800> open<00:01:19.800> D<00:01:19.980> strings

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
part is for open D strings

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.510 
part is for open D strings
nice<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.440> easy<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> first<00:01:22.980> bit<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:25.520> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
nice and easy that first bit and then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.790 
nice and easy that first bit and then
we're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.940> from<00:01:27.150> fret<00:01:27.479> 3<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> string

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
we're going from fret 3 on the a string

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.030 
we're going from fret 3 on the a string
2<00:01:29.370> fret<00:01:29.400> 5<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.240> D<00:01:30.360> string<00:01:30.390> first<00:01:33.950> part<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
2 fret 5 on the D string first part the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.090 
2 fret 5 on the D string first part the
riff<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:36.030> next<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.660> bit<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:40.140> going

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
riff and the next little bit is going

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.480 
riff and the next little bit is going
from<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.060> 0<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> 3<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.200> 0<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> D<00:01:43.979> string<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
from the 0 to 3 to 0 on the D string so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.459 
from the 0 to 3 to 0 on the D string so
you

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.469 

that's<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.369> first<00:01:51.609> section<00:01:51.999> to<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.179> riff<00:01:52.299> so

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
that's the first section to the riff so

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.849 
that's the first section to the riff so
this<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.689> all<00:01:52.840> single<00:01:53.350> notes<00:01:53.560> there's<00:01:53.770> no

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
this is all single notes there's no

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.980 
this is all single notes there's no
power<00:01:54.159> chords<00:01:54.520> anything<00:01:54.819> at<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.939> moment

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.779 

so<00:02:00.530> notice<00:02:00.799> that's<00:02:00.950> why<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.219> using<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.579> side

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
so notice that's why I'm using the side

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.219 
so notice that's why I'm using the side
of<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.060> finger<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.539> rest<00:02:02.719> across<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.020> other

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
of this finger to rest across the other

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.870 
of this finger to rest across the other
strings<00:02:03.530> because<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.829> don't<00:02:04.009> want<00:02:06.789> lots<00:02:07.789> of

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
strings because you don't want lots of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.369 
strings because you don't want lots of
other<00:02:08.060> strings<00:02:08.509> ringing<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:08.899> trying<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> keep

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
other strings ringing out trying to keep

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.600 
other strings ringing out trying to keep
it<00:02:09.500> nice<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.649> quiet<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:10.280> hearing<00:02:10.459> that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it nice and quiet and just hearing that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.259 
it nice and quiet and just hearing that
single<00:02:10.970> note<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:16.129> that's<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> first<00:02:16.730> part<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
single note so that's the first part the

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.119 
single note so that's the first part the
next<00:02:17.900> little<00:02:18.140> bit<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.500> bit<00:02:18.709> tricky

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
next little bit it's a little bit tricky

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.949 
next little bit it's a little bit tricky
we've<00:02:19.280> got<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.700> power<00:02:20.209> chord<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> string

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
we've got a power chord on the a string

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.089 
we've got a power chord on the a string
a<00:02:21.590> string<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:22.010> D<00:02:22.160> string<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.959> that's<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.140> C<00:02:24.410> C<00:02:24.830> 5

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
a string and D string so that's a C C 5

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.100 
a string and D string so that's a C C 5
C<00:02:25.459> power<00:02:25.640> chord<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.090> we're<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.750> slide

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
C power chord and we're going to slide

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.710 
C power chord and we're going to slide
up<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.980> five<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.910> seven

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.020 

and<00:02:32.080> then<00:02:32.500> back<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.980> three<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.340> five<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:33.880> it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
and then back to three and five so it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.430 
and then back to three and five so it's
all<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.240> one<00:02:34.420> motion<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:34.900> only<00:02:35.020> running

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
all in one motion I'm only running

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.589 
all in one motion I'm only running
picking<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.860> strings<00:02:36.160> once<00:02:36.430> there

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
picking the strings once there

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.900 
picking the strings once there
so<00:02:39.140> you're<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.379> slide

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.510 

from<00:02:42.600> three<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.230> five<00:02:43.410> back<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.890> three

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.870 

you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.090 

then<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:53.560> bit<00:02:53.650> fiddly<00:02:53.890> this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
then this is a little bit fiddly this

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.310 
then this is a little bit fiddly this
bit<00:02:54.280> we're<00:02:54.880> going<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.180> pull<00:02:55.630> off<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.080> power

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
bit we're going to pull off the power

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680 
bit we're going to pull off the power
cord<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.190> open<00:02:57.520> strings<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.360> after<00:02:58.600> you've

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
cord to the open strings so after you've

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.950 
cord to the open strings so after you've
done<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.960> slide

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.449 

you're<00:03:02.560> gonna<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.830> putting<00:03:03.070> off

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.979 

the<00:03:07.000> whole<00:03:07.150> power<00:03:07.359> cord<00:03:07.659> so<00:03:07.719> that's<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the whole power cord so that's the a

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.100 
the whole power cord so that's the a
string<00:03:08.409> and<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> D<00:03:08.829> string

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.930 

and<00:03:11.650> at<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:11.860> point<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.250> doesn't<00:03:12.460> matter<00:03:12.580> too

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
and at this point it doesn't matter too

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.490 
and at this point it doesn't matter too
much<00:03:13.090> if<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.570> catch<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.020> g-string

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
much if you catch the g-string

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.170 
much if you catch the g-string
underneath<00:03:14.950> because<00:03:15.460> it's<00:03:15.700> going<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.880> be<00:03:15.970> so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
underneath because it's going to be so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.250 
underneath because it's going to be so
quick

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
quick

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.140 
quick
before<00:03:19.159> we<00:03:19.250> go<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.610> next<00:03:19.760> section<00:03:20.000> so

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
before we go to the next section so

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.880 
before we go to the next section so
I<00:03:22.409> see<00:03:23.409> it<00:03:23.650> three<00:03:24.430> five<00:03:24.940> three

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
I see it three five three

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.160 
I see it three five three
and<00:03:27.250> then<00:03:27.400> off<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.540> then<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:29.110> can<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.470> do<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
and then off and then we can I do a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.140 
and then off and then we can I do a
quick<00:03:32.170> slide<00:03:32.590> from<00:03:33.040> flip<00:03:33.340> three<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.570> fret<00:03:34.870> 5<00:03:35.110> on

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
quick slide from flip three to fret 5 on

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.050 
quick slide from flip three to fret 5 on
the<00:03:37.150> DDA<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.960> D<00:03:38.110> string<00:03:38.320> so<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:38.590> er

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the DDA and the D string so that's er

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.700 
the DDA and the D string so that's er
then<00:03:40.060> f5<00:03:40.690> power<00:03:41.020> chord<00:03:41.320> up<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:43.050> g5<00:03:44.050> power<00:03:44.440> chord

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
then f5 power chord up to g5 power chord

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.330 
then f5 power chord up to g5 power chord
so<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.700> whole<00:03:45.880> section<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:46.570> far

da-daddy fret 3 to fret 2 at the very
end<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.039> I'll<00:04:30.490> play<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.759> whole<00:04:30.789> things<00:04:31.120> really

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.239 

you

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.249 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:57.400 

then<00:04:47.029> you<00:04:47.179> went<00:04:47.359> to<00:04:47.509> start<00:04:47.779> there

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.320 

so<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.860> comes<00:04:59.220> in<00:04:59.370> on<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.580> first<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
so the one comes in on that first of the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.370 
so the one comes in on that first of the
four<00:05:00.690> opening<00:05:01.350> strings<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:03.060> that's<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.389> riff

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.560 

okay<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.590> when<00:05:08.009> I<00:05:08.039> showed<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.460> riff<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.970> was

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
okay so when I showed you the riff I was

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.650 
okay so when I showed you the riff I was
using<00:05:09.810> all<00:05:09.930> down<00:05:10.199> picks<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.180> bit<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.419> a<00:05:12.479> palm

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
using all down picks and a bit of a palm

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.719 
using all down picks and a bit of a palm
huge<00:05:12.900> nuts<00:05:13.080> using<00:05:13.259> it<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.250> if<00:05:14.310> your<00:05:14.430> hand<00:05:14.580> on

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
huge nuts using it so if your hand on

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.900 
huge nuts using it so if your hand on
the<00:05:14.820> strings<00:05:15.860> so<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:16.889> played<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.310> I'll<00:05:17.639> play<00:05:17.789> the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
the strings so I played it I'll play the

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.490 
the strings so I played it I'll play the
whole<00:05:17.970> way<00:05:18.180> through<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.690> using<00:05:19.110> these<00:05:19.199> down

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
whole way through with using these down

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.439 
whole way through with using these down
picks<00:05:19.860> first<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.430> then<00:05:20.940> I'll<00:05:21.150> show<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.360> you

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
picks first and then I'll show if you

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.730 
picks first and then I'll show if you
need<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.690> if<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:21.930> want<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.080> try<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.350> speed<00:05:22.620> it

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
need to if you want to try and speed it

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.230 
need to if you want to try and speed it
up<00:05:22.889> you're<00:05:23.070> going<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.220> have<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.490> use<00:05:23.639> alternate

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
up you're going to have to use alternate

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.969 
up you're going to have to use alternate
picking<00:05:24.419> because<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.110> those<00:05:25.350> first<00:05:25.680> four

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
picking because that those first four

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.749 
picking because that those first four
notes<00:05:27.680> become<00:05:28.680> very<00:05:28.889> tricky<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.370> do<00:05:29.520> with<00:05:29.669> all

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
notes become very tricky to do with all

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:48.839 
notes become very tricky to do with all
down<00:05:29.910> picks<00:05:30.150> so

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.909 

so<00:05:49.849> that's<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.330> riff<00:05:50.509> sort<00:05:50.930> of<00:05:50.990> nice<00:05:51.440> and<00:05:51.650> slow

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
so that's the riff sort of nice and slow

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.510 
so that's the riff sort of nice and slow
really<00:05:52.129> all<00:05:52.310> with<00:05:52.520> down<00:05:52.729> pics<00:05:54.340> but<00:05:55.340> if<00:05:55.460> you

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
really all with down pics but if you

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.749 
really all with down pics but if you
want<00:05:55.639> to<00:05:55.699> speed<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.180> up<00:05:57.009> it's<00:05:58.009> much<00:05:58.310> easier<00:05:58.699> to

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
want to speed it up it's much easier to

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.600 
want to speed it up it's much easier to
use<00:05:58.849> an<00:05:59.240> alternate<00:05:59.780> pic<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:01.039> I<00:06:01.069> won't<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.400> might

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
use an alternate pic so I won't I might

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.070 
use an alternate pic so I won't I might
take<00:06:01.729> you<00:06:01.819> to<00:06:01.940> exactly<00:06:02.030> not<00:06:02.539> for<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> note<00:06:02.900> on<00:06:02.930> it

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
take you to exactly not for a note on it

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.689 
take you to exactly not for a note on it
how<00:06:03.289> to<00:06:03.349> use<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.190> alternate<00:06:04.520> picking

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
how to use that the alternate picking

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.610 
how to use that the alternate picking
all<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.030> way<00:06:05.150> through<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.449> riff<00:06:05.629> but<00:06:05.990> you'll

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
all the way through the riff but you'll

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.550 
all the way through the riff but you'll
find<00:06:06.889> its<00:06:07.039> most<00:06:07.400> handy<00:06:07.849> on<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.060> first<00:06:08.330> bit<00:06:08.690> on

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
find its most handy on the first bit on

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.649 
find its most handy on the first bit on
those<00:06:10.190> first<00:06:10.460> four<00:06:10.789> open<00:06:11.270> strings

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.239 

it's<00:06:15.139> much<00:06:15.349> easier<00:06:15.829> than<00:06:16.149> you<00:06:17.149> know<00:06:17.269> trying<00:06:17.539> to

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:18.249 
it's much easier than you know trying to

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.019 
it's much easier than you know trying to
quickly<00:06:19.249> come<00:06:19.429> back<00:06:19.459> to<00:06:19.669> the<00:06:19.729> top<00:06:19.909> of<00:06:19.939> the

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
quickly come back to the top of the

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.309 
quickly come back to the top of the
string<00:06:20.239> and<00:06:20.360> then<00:06:20.449> hit<00:06:20.899> the<00:06:20.989> string<00:06:21.199> from

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
string and then hit the string from

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.009 
string and then hit the string from
above<00:06:22.029> much<00:06:23.029> easier<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.449> use<00:06:23.479> an<00:06:23.629> alternate

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.019 
above much easier to use an alternate

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.919 
above much easier to use an alternate
pick<00:06:24.199> so<00:06:25.239> this<00:06:26.239> is<00:06:26.360> what<00:06:26.479> it<00:06:26.569> sounds<00:06:26.779> like<00:06:26.839> a

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:26.929 
pick so this is what it sounds like a

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:38.210 
pick so this is what it sounds like a
little<00:06:27.079> bit<00:06:27.319> quicker

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:47.879 

a<00:06:38.280> lot<00:06:38.790> quicker<00:06:39.000> when<00:06:39.480> we<00:06:39.660> do<00:06:39.780> a<00:06:39.810> lot<00:06:39.990> quicker

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.749 

so<00:06:48.729> as<00:06:48.789> you<00:06:48.909> see<00:06:49.030> it's<00:06:49.090> much<00:06:49.270> easier<00:06:50.550> using<00:06:51.550> an

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
so as you see it's much easier using an

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.189 
so as you see it's much easier using an
alternate<00:06:52.180> pick<00:06:52.360> just<00:06:52.629> especially<00:06:52.780> on<00:06:53.110> those

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
alternate pick just especially on those

00:06:53.199 --> 00:07:02.170 
alternate pick just especially on those
first<00:06:53.409> four<00:06:53.680> notes

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.240
