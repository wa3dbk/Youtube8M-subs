00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I am 120 kilometers from 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.480
 santiago in san fernando just in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.300
 the house where a man who has lived 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.940
 dedicated all his life to the horses don 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.240
 ruperto valderrama miranda let's go to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 know something of its history for this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 illustrious citizen of san fernando win 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 at 10 years a competition one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.320
 experience that marked him for life was 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 for 21 years the collar of don ramón 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 cardemil moraga and next to him he marked the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.730
 five national titles we are going to know 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.800
 which according to many is the best 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.550
 horse regulator that has had 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 Chile 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 as a perfect state very well liked 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 because you are with me today in clothes 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 and when he starts his love for the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.559
 horses when I was studying myself 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.950
 I retired from school when my 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.260
 father 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.370
 and I had to take care of what 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.770
 I had my dad there I made the decision and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.450
 intermediate of a brother of my stepmother 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.210
 and where are you going to get your ay and to the palm 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.220
 of cable that you rent don Guillermo green 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 I saw that for me it was my father 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.300
 why 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.910
 that gave him the extraordinary affection that 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.550
 has not seen in Chile since I've 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.880
 I traveled a man better than in place 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.880
 of mind 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.810
 was humberto good and you got married 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.080
 with an eliana lady and of course she 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.810
 he met at a rodeo and a woman 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.930
 extraordinary with a patience for him 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.170
 I endured my defects it is true that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.880
 the 10 year old he ran a championship as 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.740
 did to win that championship at 10 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.840
 years 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.330
 that was the detour of the last rodeo that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.970
 San Bernardo did and I never ran 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.799
 extraordinary but never more from 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.780
 there's no enthusiasm then begins 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.659
 horses are looking for me no no no no longer when 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.149
 I started to mature and I started to give ourselves 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.890
 The reason is because the horse 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.060
 as he arranges the hands fell when 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.670
 come to the tahá there I said there and there 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.190
 I began to realize that I had to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.440
 follow the calluses 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.230
 what are the horses for you all there 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.020
 someone who remembers then 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.930
 I would have to tell of a well that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.270
 had a more grace and a day 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.640
 friday day Friday to get there 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.940
 I ran until Sunday Monday at the rodeo 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.370
 finally get to try the horses and I 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.409
 I went back into wells with garlic 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.870
 and running a man who was very good 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.200
 rider husband in the bones is called very 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.409
 known a well of pride and this gentleman 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.349
 it was called second iron and they ran 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.450
 things they have not done 25-30 no crying 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.930
 Then you told me to get ahead 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.060
 He said no, I go to the reale and I do 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.940
 I am not very honest, you are not ayala 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.620
 and the big shortcut 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.490
 of pine branches of pine needles 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.130
 pineapple hawthorn and they had left it lario and 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.190
 the posture also exploded 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.890
 perotti travers ran cute manco and the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.380
 sun fell to the farm and russian no speed 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.450
 to the dotcom now when I realized 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.910
 which is the middle of the branches without 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.760
 Brake 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.460
 no fever and no need to do when 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 the brake hanging I take it does not arrive 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.280
 notice that it is not the point that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.860
 before we did 828 and the horse again 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.410
 did it again is here and the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.400
 public later this day and I would run 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.620
 without opposite 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.390
 and you won five times in championships 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.010
 in 55 and here helped me tatita god 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 for 21 years it was the collera de don 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.299
 ramón gardens that the agreement be in 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.370
 this order and good memory I was a 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.909
 friend or we were a friend both 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 because we never had a difference of 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.530
 unit criterion and the only thing I asked 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.590
 when I calmed myself with the calluses that 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.070
 I did not get the horses with clothes 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.930
 He was a great arranger of horses 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.840
 they won a lot of national titles 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.310
 arts and that's also important because 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.199
 one thing to be a horse arranger and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.940
 another thing to be a horse arranger that 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.979
 they won all the championships I think 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.780
 that I had both of the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.139
 conditions as a preparer and as for 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.740
 what 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.599
 what would have been of his life don ruperto 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.419
 if the horses had not existed or 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.280
 if it had not been wash I said when 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.520
 I left my house even if it is to take care 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.319
 I'm going to go pig 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.840
 I was not from Sancho but I'm going to fit 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.840
 because pretty good 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.780
 i
