them out you'll see that at the edges of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.760 
them out you'll see that at the edges of
them<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.659> pacemakers<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> turned<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
them so pacemakers can be turned on and

strong magnet a magnet much stronger
than<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:14.150> as<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> result<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.810> tell

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
than what we use but as a result we tell

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
than what we use but as a result we tell
people<00:01:16.380> don't<00:01:16.680> wear<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.400> clothing<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
people don't wear our clothing that

pacemaker<00:01:22.100> some<00:01:23.100> other<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:23.490> about

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
pacemaker some other things about

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
pacemaker some other things about
magnets<00:01:24.119> why<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.200> they

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
magnets why do we use them at all they

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.010 
magnets why do we use them at all they
they<00:01:25.740> sort<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.520> keep<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> pocket<00:01:27.270> closed<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
they sort of keep the pocket closed and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.310 
they sort of keep the pocket closed and
make<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> lines<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.810> garment<00:01:31.200> look

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
make that lines of the garment look

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
make that lines of the garment look
better<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.549> say<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
better when you say you don't have to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
better when you say you don't have to
always<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.259> gives<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> sense<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
always if I'm up gives you a sense of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.080 
always if I'm up gives you a sense of
security<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.890> also<00:01:38.070> use<00:01:38.369> them<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.880> wind

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

security we also use them on some wind
flaps<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.659> keeps<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> laying<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.619> it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
flaps it keeps it laying right it's

will cause the fabric to wear a little

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.740 
will cause the fabric to wear a little
more<00:02:53.260> quickly<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:54.160> those<00:02:54.610> areas<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.510> will

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
more quickly in those areas and you will

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.259 
more quickly in those areas and you will
see<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.180> our

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
see this you know on some of our

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.600 
see this you know on some of our
garments<00:02:58.810> when<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.170> magnets<00:02:59.650> have<00:03:00.250> some

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
garments when the magnets have some

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.240 
garments when the magnets have some
exterior<00:03:01.230> location<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> pants<00:03:03.040> for

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
exterior location like the pants for

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.070 
exterior location like the pants for
example<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.940> don't<00:03:04.269> think<00:03:04.510> you'll<00:03:04.600> see<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.870> so

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
example I don't think you'll see this so

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.170 
example I don't think you'll see this so
much<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.680> lot<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.130> jackets<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
much in a lot of the jackets because the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.539 
much in a lot of the jackets because the
magnets<00:03:07.600> are<00:03:07.750> internal<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.470> pockets<00:03:08.980> so

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
magnets are internal to the pockets so

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.270 
magnets are internal to the pockets so
you<00:03:09.580> will<00:03:10.030> see<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.900> slight<00:03:11.620> wearing<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
you will see a slight wearing in the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.250 
you will see a slight wearing in the
fabric<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.150> think<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.450> looks<00:03:13.630> cool<00:03:13.989> it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
fabric but I think it looks cool it

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.820 
fabric but I think it looks cool it
looks<00:03:14.470> weathered<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.280> mean<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:16.180> not<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:17.560> not

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
a bad look it's just something to be
