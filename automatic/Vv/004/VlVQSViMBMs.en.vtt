00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 two 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.760
 how about youtube friends and today they 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.280
 I bring a new tutorial 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 It turns out that I have been told a lot 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 about what it is 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 the camera 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.920
 in slow motion on camera or inverse 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.860
 what 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.659
 kill the movie and also what 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.679
 What is it 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 and lower the sound of the audio tracks 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.460
 so when it's going to end we 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 there is a cut 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.080
 so 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.440
 so not so rigid so shocking what 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.370
 that would have to decrease slowly 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.780
 how should I do it then for it 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.780
 I will show you only that I hope 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 that can serve them 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.020
 in this case I would have gone fishing 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 a video a fragment of video for 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.040
 transform it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.040
 a desk that I do not have here 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.280
 ok this one was already transformed is not 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.640
 true we went through the first step 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.430
 We cut the fragment we want to use 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.200
 and we transform it once we finish 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.470
 the transformation of the file we're going 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.180
 to the past in this case I already have it 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.950
 how come transformed you already have it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.250
 directly from the desktop to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.629
 the working tool and here it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.700
 only we have to do as all 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.000
 the videos is to drag it to the line of 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.970
 weather 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.970
 here in the timeline we 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.990
 what are the saturation functions 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.850
 as they had seen it before 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.740
 but in this case we're just going to 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.860
 make the cut for example once 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.870
 when I'm passing the cyclist here 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.100
 let's cut 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.670
 I do not accept what the style is 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.670
 split we cut there 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.260
 and we cut later 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.860
 good 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.000
 this is a file we can duplicate it 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.130
 copying what is not true copying and 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 pasting the same here 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.960
 I was going to leave one next to the other 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.400
 and then start again 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.330
 for the third time 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.310
 to leave the three together 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.440
 and then we go to the next thing in the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.680
 middle file the one that I want that 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.470
 go to the camera backwards not not like 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.680
 as I recorded it but inverse so 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.780
 we just have to put here in reverse already 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.939
 that's all select the square of the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.860
 video that we believe and we put to it 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.390
 reverse 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.850
 reverse is not true 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.000
 obviously here the sound will be removed 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.720
 to the movie because it's something that comes 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.390
 default on it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.450
 in the program as well I told them of 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.680
 a principle does not occupy what is the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.180
 sound of the recordings then by 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.009
 So they take away all 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.820
 We took off cuadraditos kart 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.660
 chiquititos that is here 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.360
 and they will see that it is the audio herbal 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.870
 and well we have ready what is that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.610
 now we put the audio 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.510
 let's go to the desk I have an audio 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.510
 here it seems to me 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:42.469
 how others ask me how to make 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.469
 this decrease not 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.580
 we drag the audio to the line below 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:57.700
 which is we have two audio lines 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.280
 and this is where we cut it 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.770
 it is with this and then we eliminate the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.780
 fragment that remains later 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.510
 to slowly lower the audio 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.110
 first I have to listen to see if 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.110
 it was good 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.930
 so that I lower the audio slowly so 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.510
 we just have to select the track 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.140
 audio as you see is in yellow and 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.950
 we have to put him in fallout to direct him 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.950
 it's not about 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.330
 about 7 could be already 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:52.300
 anger is like the transition effect 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.680
 but the end of the audio then 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.680
 will diminish personality 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.180
 once I can appreciate it you 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.840
 still not but I'm going to leave you the 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.120
 example so you can see the same 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.750
 in the video if you do not want to leave something to 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.650
 end just put him out fat and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.650
 leaving a 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:24.349
 6.265 9 / is the average and they will see by 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:29.169
 example how the color decreases 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.169
 of image and also sound at the same time 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.580
 and I can do it here with the sound 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.600
 I will not put so they can 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.530
 appreciate you too 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:42.120
 and that and that has been all for exporting 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.280
 I recommend them 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.120
 as in this case I'm going to throw it to 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.000
 youtube youtube but later this 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.610
 tutorial I will do a 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.010
 tutorial on how to export the video from 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.220
 a way that we do not lose quality in 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.880
 social networks not because I think that 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.230
 this option of youtube decreases 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.870
 much the quality of the video does not 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.600
 and I'm going to upload a tutorial for 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.300
 to avoid that I have some examples that 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.790
 they will see them next and that has 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.210
 been I hope you like it if you like it 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.990
 the video give a like share and that 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.700
 Greetings friends and until the next video 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.470
 anything in the comment box 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.470
 any goodbye consultation
