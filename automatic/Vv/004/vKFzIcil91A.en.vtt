00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
now we'll move to a different product

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.930 
now we'll move to a different product
line<00:01:34.480> this<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.930> Power<00:01:35.440> Plus<00:01:35.800> line<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.729> is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
line this is the Power Plus line this is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.880 
line this is the Power Plus line this is
a<00:01:37.150> much<00:01:37.450> more<00:01:37.630> generic<00:01:37.810> product<00:01:38.440> as<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.710> can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
a much more generic product as you can

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.450 
a much more generic product as you can
see<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:41.140> don't<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.440> as<00:01:41.530> many<00:01:41.650> plugins<00:01:42.130> as<00:01:42.310> we

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
see we don't have as many plugins as we

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.280 
see we don't have as many plugins as we
did<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.790> classic<00:01:43.150> update<00:01:43.479> line<00:01:43.659> we<00:01:44.080> can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
did in the classic update line we can

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.020 
did in the classic update line we can
still<00:01:44.560> do<00:01:44.740> some<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.370> can<00:01:45.490> do<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.700> headlight

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
still do some we can do the headlight

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.120 
still do some we can do the headlight
switch<00:01:46.210> we<00:01:46.479> can<00:01:46.630> do<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> steering<00:01:47.200> column<00:01:47.350> but

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
switch we can do a steering column but

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.620 
switch we can do a steering column but
because<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.760> nature<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.180> product

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
because of the nature of this product

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.539 
because of the nature of this product
and<00:01:49.720> how<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:49.960> would<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.260> mounted<00:01:50.440> there's<00:01:51.159> so

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
and how it would be mounted there's so

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.410 
and how it would be mounted there's so
much<00:01:51.700> we<00:01:51.880> can't<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:53.760> made<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.909> be<00:01:55.060> mounted

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
much we can't do made to be mounted
