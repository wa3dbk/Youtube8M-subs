00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 I want to say hello to everyone today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 talk a little about phones well and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 of course discuss the iphone know now 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.849
 all youngsters are mostly girls of years 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.809
 so 13 maybe 15 take yourself an iphone and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.369
 literally dreaming of him is the purpose of life 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 get yourself this fancy phone 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 honestly i have an iphone 5s and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 were a previous model but now I 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 so pofigu on the phone and that i even 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.449
 In my thoughts I do not think to change my 5s to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.760
 something new 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.349
 the next few years so exactly and by 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 call me only for calls 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.399
 serious use your phone 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 maximum it calls notes but also 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.600
 calculator for study and basically this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 all for more phone I do not need 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 I once had the same money to have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 the most fashionable newest phone and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.500
 Actually, that's why I bought every 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 year new iphone 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 but now I honestly got terribly tired 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.370
 I see no reason to buy the same iphone 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.230
 6 for fifty sixty thousand only 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.280
 from the fact that there is a big display and he 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.109
 a bit newer 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 but why then the rest of the people are so 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 strongly fan on iphone everything 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.260
 more surprised like little girls 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 for the sake of free iPhone out repost in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150
 social networks of the type did repost 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 iphone or ps4 and so on fill VVK 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 almost all these contests 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 cheating in most cases it never 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.490
 need to believe it let's get back to our 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.770
 The main theme of the iphone is now type 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.630
 fashionable, many believe that if they buy 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.579
 yourself a new phone, then they will 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.369
 a little bit I'm not attracted better 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.320
 but damn it's not like that every day 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 I see a bunch of stupid busses on buses 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
 who does not let his background on either 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 second seriously all the way they hold 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 your phone is updated in to every minute 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.119
 as if someone important to them wrote there 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.799
 constantly but it is only half woes i 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.509
 I think that girls with the advent of all 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.729
 these iPhones have become even dumber 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.580
 seriously most girls who have 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.830
 fashionable phone from apple 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.590
 go like a monkey picture and all that 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.960
 moving fotkayut food make a thousand selfi 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.820
 in a minute and it all poured his inst 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.420
 and of course the dumbest add 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.940
 hashtags 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.920
 mutual likes and subscriptions this is me all 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.180
 kills more by the way until recently 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.670
 time i had a buddy 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.420
 and he constantly every year when he went out 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.970
 new iphone 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.710
 he borrowed money took loans to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.600
 hurry to buy it, that is, the check was 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.730
 so sick fanatic that he gave 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.940
 last money only to upgrade there 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 my fifth iphone for 5s and so on i 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 I think that this is some kind of disease or 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 at least stupid fanaticism to give 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.800
 last money for the phone while 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.800
 buy it on credit and then another month 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.170
 nothing really there but it fucking of course 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.240
 buy new gadgets vidyuhi phones 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 console console this is cool 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.080
 awesome but only if you have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.910
 money for them they are like most people 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.440
 buy everything on credit then 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.959
 few months literally live like 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.730
 homeless but walk with iphone in principle 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.590
