00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
nicely onto a 58 millimeter filter but

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
nicely onto a 58 millimeter filter but
that<00:01:33.180> doesn't<00:01:33.329> mean<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.650> only<00:01:34.799> fifty

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that doesn't mean that it's only fifty

eight<00:01:35.369> millimeters<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:36.900> screws<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> too

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
eight millimeters it also screws on too

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.010 
eight millimeters it also screws on too
many<00:01:39.180> other<00:01:39.740> lens<00:01:40.740> filters<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.689> come<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
many other lens filters so they come in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
many other lens filters so they come in
different<00:01:43.229> sizes<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.509> how<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> looks

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
different sizes and this is how it looks

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.290 
different sizes and this is how it looks
like<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> UV<00:01:49.590> filter

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.830 

I<00:01:55.050> haven't<00:01:56.050> had<00:01:56.170> any<00:01:56.560> problems<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.250> these

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I haven't had any problems with these

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.330 
I haven't had any problems with these
but<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:01.540> are<00:02:01.720> pretty<00:02:02.170> cheap<00:02:02.350> which<00:02:03.040> might

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
but they are pretty cheap which might

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.230 
but they are pretty cheap which might
ruin<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.950> quality<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:05.980> your<00:02:06.220> images<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:10.030> I

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
ruin the quality of your images but I

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.500 
ruin the quality of your images but I
haven't<00:02:10.510> had<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.690> problem<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.210> haven't

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
haven't had that problem but I haven't

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.020 
haven't had that problem but I haven't
really<00:02:13.840> tested<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.950> sharply<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.820> they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
really tested really sharply that they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.780 
really tested really sharply that they
would<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:18.600> comparing<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.840> UM<00:02:20.200> ahoy<00:02:20.950> hoy<00:02:21.760> ax

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
would so comparing to UM ahoy hoy ax

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.870 
would so comparing to UM ahoy hoy ax
filter<00:02:22.570> which<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.130> best<00:02:24.400> brands

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
filter which is one of the best brands

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.770 
filter which is one of the best brands
for<00:02:25.060> filters<00:02:26.520> these<00:02:27.900> three<00:02:29.550> lens<00:02:31.800> filters<00:02:32.800> are

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
for filters these three lens filters are

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.170 
for filters these three lens filters are
okay<00:02:34.780> quality<00:02:35.440> though<00:02:36.190> when<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.550> see<00:02:36.850> this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
okay quality though when you see this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.980 
okay quality though when you see this
outer<00:02:37.630> Ridge<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.340> oil<00:02:39.610> filter<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.960> a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
outer Ridge of the oil filter it is a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.310 
outer Ridge of the oil filter it is a
lot<00:02:41.230> smoother<00:02:42.100> than<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.090> cuz<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.050> about

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
lot smoother than this cuz this is about

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.640 
lot smoother than this cuz this is about
plastic<00:02:45.190> around<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.760> outside<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:47.320> black

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
plastic around the outside the black

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.110 
plastic around the outside the black
ring<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:50.710> has<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.160> little<00:02:51.400> bit<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.730> rubber

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
ring and this has a little bit of rubber

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.729 
ring and this has a little bit of rubber
grip<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:54.000> saying<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.480> Hoya<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.470> little

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
grip so saying that the Hoya is a little

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:06.180 
grip so saying that the Hoya is a little
better<00:03:01.620> comparing<00:03:02.620> these<00:03:02.890> two<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
better comparing these two the of the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.070 
better comparing these two the of the
glass<00:03:07.350> they<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.640> sprit<00:03:09.640> II<00:03:09.670> much<00:03:09.970> similar<00:03:10.810> in

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
glass they are sprit II much similar in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.530 
glass they are sprit II much similar in
my<00:03:11.320> case<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.680> oil<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.430> probably<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.940> few

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
my case the oil is probably a few

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.750 
my case the oil is probably a few
centimeters<00:03:14.410> thicker<00:03:19.980> coil<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.160> made<00:03:21.489> from

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
centimeters thicker coil is made from

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.610 
centimeters thicker coil is made from
Japan<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.650> as<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.900> they<00:03:25.900> are<00:03:26.080> both<00:03:26.260> made

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
Japan and so as this they are both made

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.430 
Japan and so as this they are both made
from<00:03:27.010> Japan<00:03:28.290> tell<00:03:29.290> they're<00:03:29.590> both<00:03:29.980> made<00:03:30.550> from

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
from Japan tell they're both made from

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.100 
from Japan tell they're both made from
Japan<00:03:33.780> um<00:03:35.760> they<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:36.820> have<00:03:37.090> different<00:03:37.360> quality

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
Japan um they do have different quality

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.520 
Japan um they do have different quality
but<00:03:38.440> oil<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.520> one<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.970> best<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.380> you're

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
but oil is one of the best so if you're

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.710 
but oil is one of the best so if you're
trying<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.830> invest<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.670> really<00:03:42.970> good<00:03:43.090> filter

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
trying to invest on a really good filter

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.000 
trying to invest on a really good filter
where<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.380> best<00:03:45.330> now<00:03:46.330> comes<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.230> review<00:03:47.800> of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
where is the best now comes to review of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.520 
where is the best now comes to review of
these<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.209> I'm<00:03:49.330> going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.510> be<00:03:49.600> testing<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.260> on

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
these so I'm going to be testing this on

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.210 
these so I'm going to be testing this on
my<00:03:50.890> 18<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.610> 55<00:03:51.910> millimeter<00:03:52.720> kit<00:03:53.470> lens<00:03:53.739> and

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
my 18 to 55 millimeter kit lens and

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.150 
my 18 to 55 millimeter kit lens and
let's

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
let's

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.330 
let's
see<00:03:55.420> all<00:03:56.420> right<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.960> there's<00:03:57.260> no<00:03:57.500> filter<00:03:58.070> on

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
see all right so there's no filter on

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.570 
see all right so there's no filter on
right<00:03:58.640> now<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.660> is<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.200> UV<00:04:01.100> filter<00:04:01.550> I

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
right now and this is the UV filter I

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.350 
right now and this is the UV filter I
have<00:04:01.940> right<00:04:02.150> here<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:04.640> as<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.090> see

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
have right here so as you can see

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.720 
have right here so as you can see
there's<00:04:05.600> no<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:06.200> big<00:04:06.410> difference<00:04:06.730> that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
there's no really big difference that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.900 
there's no really big difference that
affects<00:04:08.150> your<00:04:08.360> images<00:04:08.840> at<00:04:09.050> least<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.440> me<00:04:09.910> so

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
affects your images at least to me so

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
affects your images at least to me so
cheap<00:04:11.540> few<00:04:12.170> filters<00:04:12.590> might<00:04:13.130> not<00:04:13.310> cause<00:04:13.930> bad

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
cheap few filters might not cause bad

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.070 
cheap few filters might not cause bad
image<00:04:15.620> quality<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:17.209> right<00:04:17.630> now<00:04:17.660> I'm<00:04:17.930> using

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
image quality so right now I'm using

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.340 
image quality so right now I'm using
auto<00:04:18.530> white<00:04:18.860> balance<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:20.110> this<00:04:21.110> is<00:04:21.350> my<00:04:22.300> floor

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
auto white balance and this is my floor

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.410 
auto white balance and this is my floor
fluorescent<00:04:24.350> you<00:04:24.770> filter<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.660> when<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.990> put<00:04:27.170> son

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
fluorescent you filter so when I put son

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810 
fluorescent you filter so when I put son
it<00:04:29.420> just<00:04:29.480> changes<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.500> image<00:04:31.100> into<00:04:31.400> purple

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
it just changes the image into purple

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.420 
it just changes the image into purple
though<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.330> does<00:04:32.540> correct<00:04:33.130> from<00:04:34.130> this

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
though it does correct from this

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.360 
though it does correct from this
yellowish<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.260> more<00:04:37.250> better<00:04:37.970> type<00:04:39.370> yellow

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
yellowish to a more better type yellow

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.020 
yellowish to a more better type yellow
and<00:04:40.790> orange<00:04:42.430> or<00:04:43.430> purple<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.410> does<00:04:45.620> help<00:04:46.030> but

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
and orange or purple so it does help but

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.840 
and orange or purple so it does help but
when<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.280> white<00:04:49.280> balance<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:49.730> can

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
when you have white balance you can

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.940 
when you have white balance you can
choose<00:04:50.150> on<00:04:50.300> camera<00:04:50.810> you<00:04:51.260> really<00:04:51.530> don't<00:04:51.740> need

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
choose on camera you really don't need

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.020 
choose on camera you really don't need
this<00:04:52.010> filter<00:04:52.960> it's<00:04:53.960> not<00:04:54.170> really<00:04:54.320> recommended

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
this filter it's not really recommended

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.840 
this filter it's not really recommended
because<00:04:56.410> you<00:04:57.410> don't<00:04:57.560> really<00:04:57.650> want<00:04:58.400> this

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
because you don't really want this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.700 
because you don't really want this
because<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.450> already<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.840> settings<00:05:00.530> you

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
because you already have settings you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.300 
because you already have settings you
can<00:05:00.770> change<00:05:01.100> on<00:05:01.490> your<00:05:01.610> camera<00:05:02.890> all<00:05:03.890> right<00:05:04.130> up

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
can change on your camera all right up

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.930 
can change on your camera all right up
next<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.870> CPL<00:05:06.650> filter<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:07.400> cannot

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
next is the CPL filter this cannot

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.900 
next is the CPL filter this cannot
really<00:05:08.150> be<00:05:08.450> tested<00:05:08.960> here<00:05:09.040> but<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.790> about

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
really be tested here but it's about

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.290 
really be tested here but it's about
cloudy<00:05:11.810> outside<00:05:12.169> right<00:05:12.860> now<00:05:12.890> so<00:05:13.610> i'm<00:05:14.210> gonna

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
cloudy outside right now so i'm gonna

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.720 
cloudy outside right now so i'm gonna
screw<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:14.660> on<00:05:14.900> actually<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:16.130> one<00:05:16.310> second

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
screw this on actually just one second

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.060 
screw this on actually just one second
I'll<00:05:16.910> be<00:05:16.970> right<00:05:17.120> back<00:05:17.390> so<00:05:17.960> this<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.560> CPL

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
I'll be right back so this is a CPL

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.090 
I'll be right back so this is a CPL
filter<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.760> is<00:05:19.940> really<00:05:20.360> cloudy<00:05:21.169> at<00:05:21.620> about

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
filter it is really cloudy at about

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.950 
filter it is really cloudy at about
nighttime<00:05:22.430> ish<00:05:23.140> it's<00:05:24.140> almost<00:05:24.710> um<00:05:25.720> setting<00:05:26.720> so

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
nighttime ish it's almost um setting so

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.400 
nighttime ish it's almost um setting so
CPL<00:05:27.860> filter<00:05:27.890> has<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.430> screw<00:05:29.060> that<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.510> can<00:05:29.750> use

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
CPL filter has a screw that you can use

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.550 
CPL filter has a screw that you can use
and<00:05:30.980> it<00:05:31.400> changes<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:32.060> blueness<00:05:32.750> of<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.290> sky

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
and it changes the blueness of the sky

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.640 
and it changes the blueness of the sky
so<00:05:34.010> i'm<00:05:34.940> using<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.330> right<00:05:35.480> now<00:05:35.510> see<00:05:36.110> how<00:05:36.290> it

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
so i'm using it right now see how it

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.900 
so i'm using it right now see how it
affects<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.250> blue<00:05:37.490> in<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:38.300> sky<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.770> see<00:05:40.760> how

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
affects the blue in the sky and see how

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.000 
affects the blue in the sky and see how
it<00:05:41.060> takes<00:05:41.270> it<00:05:41.510> out<00:05:41.630> see<00:05:41.960> this<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.230> darkest<00:05:42.830> as

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
it takes it out see this is darkest as

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.440 
it takes it out see this is darkest as
it<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.370> get<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:44.510> overall<00:05:45.230> this<00:05:45.560> is<00:05:46.450> really

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
it can get so overall this is really

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.560 
it can get so overall this is really
pretty<00:05:47.750> nice<00:05:48.050> feature<00:05:48.410> for<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.430> CPL<00:05:50.150> um<00:05:52.570> so

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
pretty nice feature for the CPL um so

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.140 
pretty nice feature for the CPL um so
over<00:05:53.900> all<00:05:54.260> these<00:05:54.680> are<00:05:54.890> pretty<00:05:55.190> nice<00:05:55.490> filters

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
over all these are pretty nice filters

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.570 
over all these are pretty nice filters
though<00:05:56.480> this<00:05:57.200> one<00:05:57.470> is<00:05:57.710> pretty<00:05:57.980> much<00:05:58.310> useless

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
though this one is pretty much useless

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.090 
though this one is pretty much useless
because<00:05:59.150> i<00:05:59.540> wouldn't<00:05:59.990> use<00:06:00.140> it<00:06:00.169> if<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:00.710> were<00:06:00.890> you

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
because i wouldn't use it if I were you

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.270 
because i wouldn't use it if I were you
these<00:06:01.970> two<00:06:02.330> are<00:06:02.600> pretty<00:06:03.020> nice<00:06:03.260> this<00:06:03.830> protects

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
these two are pretty nice this protects

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.830 
these two are pretty nice this protects
your<00:06:04.460> lens<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.450> makes<00:06:05.720> the

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
your lens and this makes the

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.439 
your lens and this makes the
um<00:06:07.110> skies<00:06:07.620> blue<00:06:07.889> so<00:06:08.340> this<00:06:08.699> is<00:06:08.850> a<00:06:08.880> pretty<00:06:09.150> nice

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
um skies blue so this is a pretty nice

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.520 
um skies blue so this is a pretty nice
um<00:06:09.949> feature<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.610> this<00:06:12.389> one<00:06:12.630> pretty<00:06:13.139> okay

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530
