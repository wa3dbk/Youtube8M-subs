daddy<00:01:36.609> put<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.329> there<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.539> then<00:01:37.689> change

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
daddy put it in there and then change

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.859 
daddy put it in there and then change
over<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.469> dns<00:01:38.829> settings<00:01:39.359> both<00:01:40.359> is<00:01:40.539> something

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
over the dns settings both is something

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.730 
over the dns settings both is something
you<00:01:40.929> can<00:01:41.049> just<00:01:41.079> use<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.409> their<00:01:41.499> free

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you can just use on their free

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.169 
you can just use on their free
subdomains<00:01:42.039> we're<00:01:42.369> going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.549> use<00:01:42.700> test<00:01:42.999> one

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
subdomains we're going to use test one

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.609 
subdomains we're going to use test one
hopefully<00:01:43.569> it's<00:01:43.630> available<00:01:43.889> click<00:01:44.889> setup<00:01:45.249> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
hopefully it's available click setup and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.539 
hopefully it's available click setup and
this<00:01:47.619> will<00:01:48.039> go<00:01:48.340> through<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.240> setup<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:51.159> is

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
this will go through the setup which is

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.319 
this will go through the setup which is
for<00:01:52.539> some<00:01:52.689> reason<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.170> takes<00:01:53.590> or<00:01:54.340> rather<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
for some reason it takes or rather the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.819 
for some reason it takes or rather the
dispatch<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.869> load<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.469> did<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.799> other

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
dispatch to load and I did it the other

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.389 
dispatch to load and I did it the other
day<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:58.539> do<00:01:58.959> this<00:01:59.079> tutorial<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.499> the<00:02:00.100> patient

very<00:02:04.409> awkward<00:02:04.560> once<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.520> done<00:02:05.549> you'll

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
very awkward once this is done you'll

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.700 
very awkward once this is done you'll
get<00:02:06.179> it<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.450> it'll<00:02:07.350> come<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.499> with<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
building it which takes in only five

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.119 
building it which takes in only five
minutes<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.620> luck<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.010> be

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
minutes if you really luck it will be

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.100 
minutes if you really luck it will be
done<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.299> time<00:02:15.480> actually<00:02:15.660> loads<00:02:15.959> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
done but the time actually loads the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.559 
done but the time actually loads the
account<00:02:16.319> page<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.330> and
