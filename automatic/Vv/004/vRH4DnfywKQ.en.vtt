00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
attempting to do my fault codes on my

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:21.920 
attempting to do my fault codes on my
GSXR<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.719> looks<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.410> computer

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.490 

that's<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> plug<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.279> need<00:00:27.320> those<00:00:28.320> are

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that's the plug that we need those are

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.430 
that's the plug that we need those are
the<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:28.830> wires

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.660 

and<00:00:35.800> hopefully<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:39.309> right<00:00:40.019> up<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:55.020 
dick sir
we're<00:00:43.870> having

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.780 

default<00:00:55.900> code

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.280 

f1<00:01:02.690> okay<00:01:04.040> I've<00:01:05.040> already<00:01:05.430> previously<00:01:06.290> unbolted

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
f1 okay I've already previously unbolted

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.730 
f1 okay I've already previously unbolted
everything<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> save<00:01:08.070> time<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.910> camera

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
everything to save time for the camera

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.450 
everything to save time for the camera
so<00:01:10.740> we'll<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.070> simply<00:01:11.250> pop<00:01:11.580> off<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> seat

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
so we'll just simply pop off the seat

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.400 
so we'll just simply pop off the seat
we'll<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.000> clips<00:01:15.300> here<00:01:15.720> we'll

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
we'll take out some clips here we'll

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.880 
we'll take out some clips here we'll
take<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> solo<00:01:17.040> seat<00:01:17.430> off<00:01:21.410> you'll<00:01:22.410> undo<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
take the solo seat off you'll undo the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
take the solo seat off you'll undo the
cable<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.340> locks<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> then

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
cable that locks in here and then

to unclip that water there I've

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
to unclip that water there I've
disconnected<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
disconnected this or here because this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
disconnected this or here because this
is<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> thought<00:01:54.330> my<00:01:54.540> problem<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.229> because

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is what I thought my problem was because

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.969 
is what I thought my problem was because
this<00:01:55.890> box<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.930> making<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.350> different<00:01:58.740> kinds

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

off in the off position we're going to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.949 
off in the off position we're going to
turn<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> key<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:25.510> I'm<00:03:25.569> going<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.780> show<00:03:25.900> up

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.089 
turn the key on now I'm going to show up
the<00:03:26.079> system<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:31.560> stand<00:03:32.560> by<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.829> let<00:03:32.859> me<00:03:33.010> know

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
the system out stand by and let me know

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.890 
the system out stand by and let me know
how<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.370> goes

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:04:00.500 

okay

okay<00:04:03.530> all<00:04:04.530> right<00:04:04.709> with<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.099> connected<00:04:06.409> we

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
okay all right with that connected we

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:18.060 
okay all right with that connected we
should<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:10.170> our<00:04:10.909> code

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.670 

c-46

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.950 

what<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> thought

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:40.219 

that'll<00:04:30.620> be<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.919> exhaust<00:04:31.570> valve<00:04:33.340> so

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.619 

I<00:04:40.259> don't<00:04:40.919> know<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.639> box<00:04:41.819> needs<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.270> be<00:04:42.389> fixed

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
I don't know that box needs to be fixed

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.709 
I don't know that box needs to be fixed
but<00:04:43.169> anyways<00:04:43.560> that's<00:04:44.340> how<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.729> pull<00:04:45.599> your

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
but anyways that's how you pull your

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.459 
but anyways that's how you pull your
codes<00:04:46.699> for<00:04:47.699> your<00:04:47.849> ECM<00:04:48.389> now<00:04:48.870> they<00:04:49.050> say<00:04:49.259> if<00:04:49.319> you

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
codes for your ECM now they say if you

00:04:49.469 --> 00:05:00.600 
codes for your ECM now they say if you
turn<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.800> off<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:51.509> code<00:04:51.749> is<00:04:51.930> erased<00:04:54.050> let's<00:04:55.050> see

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:12.820
