00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.980 
for it I don't even use these because of
their<00:02:33.580> hard<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.940> tie<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.600> that's<00:02:34.720> something

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
their hard to tie in so that's something

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.640 
their hard to tie in so that's something
i<00:02:35.200> don't<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:37.350> rotatable<00:02:38.350> mount

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
i don't really like the rotatable mount

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890 
i don't really like the rotatable mount
which<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.060> basically<00:02:40.180> stick<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:40.750> under

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and then the flat surface mount which is

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.759 
and then the flat surface mount which is
it<00:02:47.010> okay<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.310> wait<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.700> slide<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.769> and

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
it okay to wait just slide this out and

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.250 
it okay to wait just slide this out and
that<00:02:49.950> looks<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.220> that's<00:02:50.340> about<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.840> get
