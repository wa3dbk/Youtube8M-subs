00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.110
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.619
 new video of this new channel 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.450
 Youtube 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.340
 we are sure destiny and today 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.480
 I will explain to you for those who do not 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.460
 do not know it yet the meaning 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.940
 different tools like missions 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.920
 Patrol 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.570
 because yes there are icons for his 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.370
 missions and yes they are all 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.720
 different 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.070
 eventually this trick will allow you to 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.360
 complete the exploration contract of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.220
 the vanguard much faster 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.150
 but we will come back to it a little later 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.150
 iphone room 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.720
 the first justice icon is the one 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040
 that looks like a compass this 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.140
 mission will ask you to monitor a 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.400
 site for a period of time the site 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.360
 you should cover is 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.670
 usually in the neighboring area 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.660
 biographer so think activate this 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.010
 mission when you want to leave your 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 i want to tell kate that it's done 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.360
 the second icon looks like a viewfinder 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.670
 if you will be asked to kill all types 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.480
 of enemies in the neighborhood 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.490
 no need to think 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.490
 take out the guns and rake at all 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.610
 at work i warn y cora 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220
 at 3 and nikon it's very simple it's a 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 star in a square in a set car 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 this mission will ask you to kill a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.010
 priority target is by far the most 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.810
 interesting that will give you 25 points 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.100
 estimate two factions as much as rock 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.050
 or a shot from the vanguard 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.340
 all in a lot less time 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.600
 so it is very useful when you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.910
 to increase your esteem 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.290
 of one more faction the success of these 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.030
 missions and accumulated to give you 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.350
 points of view and me it's just at 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 finish your other part this mission 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 she will sometimes ask you to leave 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.990
 far to defeat the target because I had 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.990
 lucky 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.070
 here I warned the tower 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.160
 4th icon is a simple triangle 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.050
 this mission can be very fast 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.950
 as extremely shocking especially 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.080
 when you have to destroy 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.180
 collections contrary to the be icon 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.880
 there will have to kill a type of enemies 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.050
 very specific to retrieve items 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.069
 here my spectrum informs that it takes 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.870
 kill all types of waste 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
 note that this mission fits in 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.629
 depending on the area where you activate it 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.159
 that is, in an area where 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.290
 clash and a half of the hive and 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.849
 fallen you will have to kill either a guy 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.090
 of enemy the hive are a type of 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.090
 waste 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.390
 the fifth and last icon 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.430
 represents our little favorite light 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.080
 this mission will ask you to make a 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.900
 survey of the surroundings with your spectrum 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.860
 like for the compass icon try to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.990
 finish your zone 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.490
 by activating this type of mission karl you 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.300
 usually ask to scan 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.300
 surrounding areas 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.790
 that is all 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.910
 now that you know these five 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.620
 icons the six patrol missions 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.570
 daily size should no longer 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.310
 is a chore yes we know right away 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.720
 the contract flying to the tower and with a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.290
 little luck I should be able to 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.290
 do at least ten minutes 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.920
 he 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.310
 and she is today released six 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.370
 guards 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.670
 it means your specter of numbers 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.670
 in detail 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.530
 it's a lot 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.790
 you go there I got 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.910
 1 all the guards we need 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.910
 field surveys for this sum 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.630
 excellent I will warn his mother 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.730
 m 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.319
