00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.410 
quality in the hand and you can apply
your<00:02:12.980> weaponry<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.459> Steve<00:02:13.849> as<00:02:14.000> well<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.269> can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
your weaponry to Steve as well you can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.960 
your weaponry to Steve as well you can
see<00:02:14.629> we<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.050> those<00:02:15.739> grooves<00:02:16.250> inside<00:02:16.489> which

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
see we have those grooves inside which

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.270 
see we have those grooves inside which
do<00:02:17.330> match<00:02:17.810> up<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.709> grooves<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
do match up to the grooves on the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.450 
do match up to the grooves on the
weaponry<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.840> push<00:02:21.140> those<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.280> can

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
weaponry so if you push those in you can

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.130 
weaponry so if you push those in you can
see<00:02:22.640> Steve<00:02:23.000> will<00:02:23.240> hold<00:02:23.540> those<00:02:23.810> with

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
see Steve will hold those with

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380 
see Steve will hold those with
and<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.070> they<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.400> stain<00:02:26.880> they're<00:02:27.180> very

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
and that they will stain they're very

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.140 
and that they will stain they're very
secure<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:28.050> well<00:02:28.410> let's<00:02:29.160> pull<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.640> arm<00:02:29.970> up

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
secure as well let's pull this arm up

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.380 
secure as well let's pull this arm up
and<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:30.510> will<00:02:30.690> put<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.350> sword<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.090> other

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and we will put this sword in the other

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.960 
and we will put this sword in the other
hand<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:34.080> well<00:02:34.440> maybe<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.550> little<00:02:35.610> more

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
hand as well maybe a little more

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.920 
hand as well maybe a little more
difficult<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.770> sword<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.820> then<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
difficult to get the sword in then the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.950 
difficult to get the sword in then the
crossbow<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.010> go<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.120> push<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
crossbow but there you go with a push it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.930 
crossbow but there you go with a push it
is<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.290> there<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.640> that's

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
is in there so as you can see that's

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940 
is in there so as you can see that's
quite<00:02:45.240> hard<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> push<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.770> will

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
quite hard to push in there so it will

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.820 
quite hard to push in there so it will
not<00:02:47.130> come<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.520> unless<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.570> force<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.590> so

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
not come out unless you force it so so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.280 
not come out unless you force it so so
very<00:02:50.040> secure<00:02:50.490> cuffs

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
very secure cuffs

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.450 
very secure cuffs
sometimes<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.530> weapons<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.250> go<00:02:53.430> missing

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
sometimes these weapons do go missing

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.780 
sometimes these weapons do go missing
but<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:55.410> guarantee<00:02:55.830> they<00:02:56.010> won't<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.580> they

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but I can guarantee they won't if they

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
but I can guarantee they won't if they
are<00:02:56.970> secured<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.930> Steve's<00:02:58.380> hands<00:02:58.770> but<00:02:59.040> there

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
are secured in Steve's hands but there
