00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
of the frame rail and to do that I'm

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.580 
of the frame rail and to do that I'm
going<00:00:14.640> to<00:00:14.700> use<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:15.120> stock<00:00:15.450> bracket<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.049> do

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.990 
going to use the stock bracket and do
some<00:00:16.740> fabrication<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.790> move

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
some fabrication on it so we can move

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.190 
some fabrication on it so we can move
back<00:00:18.210> there<00:00:18.390> without<00:00:18.510> spending<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.050> of

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
back there without spending a lot of

start by pulling off the bolts that hold
the<00:00:32.940> battery<00:00:33.120> tray<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> radiator<00:00:34.050> core

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the battery tray to the radiator core

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.910 
the battery tray to the radiator core
support<00:00:39.140> there<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.170> two<00:00:40.440> bolts<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.770> are

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
support there are two bolts that are

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.110 
support there are two bolts that are
inside<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> core<00:00:41.489> support<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:41.970> are<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> little

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
inside the core support and are a little

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.220 
inside the core support and are a little
tough<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> reach<00:00:42.720> I<00:00:44.660> found<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> ratchet

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
tough to reach I found that a ratchet

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
tough to reach I found that a ratchet
with<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> five<00:00:46.620> inch<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.250> inch<00:00:47.370> swivel

with a five inch and a three inch swivel

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.650 
with a five inch and a three inch swivel
extension<00:00:48.150> worked<00:00:48.330> pretty<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:50.540> with<00:00:51.540> all

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
extension worked pretty well with all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.820 
extension worked pretty well with all
the<00:00:51.750> bolts<00:00:51.900> removed<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.620> ahead<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
the bolts removed we can go ahead and

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.049 
the bolts removed we can go ahead and
pull<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> battery<00:00:53.370> tray<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> core

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
pull the battery tray off the core

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.920 
pull the battery tray off the core
support

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 

and<00:00:58.020> here's<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.040> it<00:00:59.130> looks<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.400> fully

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and here's what it looks like fully

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
and here's what it looks like fully
removed<00:00:59.970> save<00:01:00.810> it<00:01:00.990> because<00:01:01.200> we'll<00:01:01.290> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
removed save it because we'll be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.079 
removed save it because we'll be
modifying<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> next<00:01:02.250> step

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
modifying it in the next step

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.630 
modifying it in the next step
one<00:01:04.989> mounting<00:01:05.379> here<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.590> larger<00:01:06.010> so<00:01:06.190> I<00:01:06.400> need<00:01:06.549> to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640

my fuel lines already follow this side
of<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.479> frame<00:04:57.689> rail<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.349> I'm<00:04:58.409> using<00:04:58.620> them<00:04:58.800> as<00:04:58.889> a

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
of the frame rail so I'm using them as a

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:06.510 
of the frame rail so I'm using them as a
path<00:04:59.189> to<00:04:59.460> run<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.759> wire

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
separate it from the other lines and if

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.770 
separate it from the other lines and if
you<00:05:15.729> have<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:15.970> cable<00:05:16.270> routing<00:05:16.419> Clips

the wire through

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.639 
the wire through
I<00:05:27.909> can<00:05:28.599> finish<00:05:28.779> pulling<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.229> wire<00:05:29.379> through

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:29.649 
I can finish pulling the wire through

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:30.899 
I can finish pulling the wire through
making<00:05:29.949> sure<00:05:30.099> it's<00:05:30.399> not<00:05:30.520> wrapped<00:05:30.759> around

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909

anything

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.790 

with<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.150> wire<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.509> length<00:05:36.540> I<00:05:36.990> can<00:05:37.320> cut<00:05:37.680> it

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
with the wire to length I can cut it

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.210 
with the wire to length I can cut it
strip<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.820> crimp<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.330> lug<00:05:39.540> on<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.780> end

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.400 

I'm<00:05:45.000> using<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.390> red<00:05:45.510> heat<00:05:45.750> shrink<00:05:45.990> tubing<00:05:46.230> to

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
I'm using the red heat shrink tubing to

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.989 
I'm using the red heat shrink tubing to
seal<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.740> connection

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:48.999 
seal the connection

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.759 
seal the connection
so<00:05:49.719> what's<00:05:49.899> the<00:05:49.989> big<00:05:50.110> deal<00:05:50.259> about<00:05:50.289> the<00:05:50.589> through

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:50.769 
so what's the big deal about the through

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:53.129 
so what's the big deal about the through
panel<00:05:51.069> connector<00:05:51.459> well<00:05:52.329> it's<00:05:52.539> an<00:05:52.659> easy<00:05:52.839> and<00:05:53.079> a

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
panel connector well it's an easy and a

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.869 
panel connector well it's an easy and a
clean<00:05:53.379> way<00:05:53.559> to<00:05:53.589> get<00:05:54.069> the<00:05:54.249> power<00:05:54.489> distribution

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 
clean way to get the power distribution

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.850 
clean way to get the power distribution
from<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.569> red<00:05:55.779> line<00:05:55.959> that<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.199> just<00:05:56.229> ran<00:05:56.649> up

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
from the red line that I just ran up

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.009 
from the red line that I just ran up
here<00:05:57.610> into<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:57.909> engine<00:05:58.209> bay<00:05:58.329> without<00:05:58.839> just

00:05:59.009 --> 00:05:59.019 
here into the engine bay without just

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:00.719 
here into the engine bay without just
leaving<00:05:59.229> an<00:05:59.319> exposed<00:05:59.709> wire<00:05:59.979> it<00:06:00.279> also<00:06:00.429> gives<00:06:00.669> me

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
leaving an exposed wire it also gives me

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.669 
leaving an exposed wire it also gives me
a<00:06:00.849> terminal<00:06:01.269> that<00:06:01.299> I<00:06:01.419> can<00:06:01.629> use<00:06:01.809> to<00:06:02.049> connect<00:06:02.529> and

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:02.679 
a terminal that I can use to connect and

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:04.619 
a terminal that I can use to connect and
disconnect<00:06:02.709> things<00:06:03.279> from<00:06:03.639> basically<00:06:04.389> giving
