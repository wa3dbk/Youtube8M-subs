creeper<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:45.260> what's<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.920> like

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
creeper but what's what I don't like

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
creeper but what's what I don't like
about<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> seems<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> recoil

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
about it is it seems like the recoil

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
about it is it seems like the recoil
with<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> iron<00:00:49.260> sights<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.190> cannot

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
with the iron sights is you just cannot

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
with the iron sights is you just cannot
be<00:00:50.730> accurate<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
be accurate with it so that's one of the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
be accurate with it so that's one of the
things<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> tried

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
things I don't like about it so I tried

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
things I don't like about it so I tried
out<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> optical<00:00:54.090> sight<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> warlord<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
out the optical sight with a warlord and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.540 
out the optical sight with a warlord and
the<00:00:55.170> dual<00:00:55.350> mags<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.160> working<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the dual mags because I was working on a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.900 
the dual mags because I was working on a
hard-line<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.710> hard-line<00:00:58.710> contract<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> was

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hard-line a hard-line contract so I was

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
hard-line a hard-line contract so I was
trying<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.440> that's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
trying to get that out of the way that's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.990 
trying to get that out of the way that's
the<00:01:01.800> only<00:01:02.039> reason<00:01:02.100> why<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:02.399> using<00:01:02.520> hardline

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the only reason why I'm using hardline

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
the only reason why I'm using hardline
otherwise<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> might<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> red<00:01:04.290> dot

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
otherwise I might just do the red dot

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
otherwise I might just do the red dot
with<00:01:04.680> scavenger<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.390> using

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
with scavenger because I like using

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960 
with scavenger because I like using
hardened<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.189> infield<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.790> seems

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
hardened with the infield because seems

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.219 
hardened with the infield because seems
like<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> stopping<00:01:09.930> power<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like it has a lot of stopping power and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.460 
like it has a lot of stopping power and
it's<00:01:10.320> nice<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.960> know<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.229> seems<00:01:13.409> like

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it's nice to know it just seems like

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.320 
it's nice to know it just seems like
it's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.130> penetrating<00:01:14.880> weapon<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it's a really good penetrating weapon as

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's a really good penetrating weapon as
where<00:01:15.600> those<00:01:15.810> famas<00:01:16.259> doesn't<00:01:16.680> really

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
where those famas doesn't really

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.719 
where those famas doesn't really
penetrate<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.939> well<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.960> more

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729

walls<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.680> i<00:01:28.740> am<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> fan<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> hardened

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
walls with it so i am a fan of hardened

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.340 
walls with it so i am a fan of hardened
with<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> mention<00:01:30.630> hardened<00:01:31.140> pro

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
with it and not to mention hardened pro

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
with it and not to mention hardened pro
really<00:01:31.770> helps<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> infield

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
really helps you with the infield

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
really helps you with the infield
because<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> view<00:01:34.170> kick

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
because you don't get that a view kick

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
because you don't get that a view kick
that<00:01:35.479> really<00:01:36.479> sent<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> downhill<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that really sent it downhill because it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
that really sent it downhill because it
has<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.750> deliberate

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
has a really like as a very deliberate

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
has a really like as a very deliberate
recoil<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.549> hard<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> control

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
recoil it's not really hard to control

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
recoil it's not really hard to control
but<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> problem<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> deliberate

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
but the problem is is so deliberate

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
but the problem is is so deliberate
whenever<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.579> shoot<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.119> it'll<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
whenever you shoot it so it'll go up and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
whenever you shoot it so it'll go up and
it'll<00:01:46.409> take<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> while<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.250> recenter

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it'll take a while for it to recenter

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
it'll take a while for it to recenter
whereas<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> Galil<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.890> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
whereas like the Galil will have really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
whereas like the Galil will have really
like<00:01:50.759> jerky<00:01:51.329> recoil<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.350> quick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
like jerky recoil but it's really quick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080 
like jerky recoil but it's really quick
to<00:01:52.710> recenter<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to recenter so that's one of the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
to recenter so that's one of the
differences<00:01:54.299> though<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.110> recoils<00:01:55.950> I've

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
differences though and recoils I've

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
differences though and recoils I've
noticed<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.729> gun<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
noticed with this gun I'm not really a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
noticed with this gun I'm not really a
fan<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.009> per<00:01:59.219> se<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.820> wouldn't<00:02:00.240> say<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
fan of it per se but I wouldn't say I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.569 
fan of it per se but I wouldn't say I
hate<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.009> some<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> people<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.369> might

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
hate it some of the people that might

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
hate it some of the people that might
play<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.719> hair<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.049> an<00:02:04.140> point<00:02:04.380> about

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
play with me my hair make an point about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
play with me my hair make an point about
about<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> lot<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.270> mean<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.079> seems

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
about it a lot but I mean it just seems

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
about it a lot but I mean it just seems
like<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.649> takes<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.039> long<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> kill<00:02:08.520> people

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
like it takes so long to kill people

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.660 
like it takes so long to kill people
with<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> sometimes<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:11.340> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
with it sometimes that it I know it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.650 
with it sometimes that it I know it's
frustrating<00:02:11.879> it's<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.599> those

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
frustrating it's one of those

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.490 
frustrating it's one of those
frustrating

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
frustrating

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
frustrating
for<00:02:13.650> me<00:02:13.800> I'm<00:02:14.700> always<00:02:14.910> getting<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.360> out

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
for me I'm always getting out out

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.930 
for me I'm always getting out out
sprayed<00:02:16.080> by<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> 74<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.070> from<00:02:17.310> long<00:02:17.490> distance

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
sprayed by the 74 you from long distance

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.810 
sprayed by the 74 you from long distance
with<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.240> which<00:02:18.860> leads<00:02:19.860> me<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.070> my<00:02:20.130> next<00:02:20.340> topic

with it which leads me to my next topic

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.580 
with it which leads me to my next topic
which<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> patch<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.230> coming<00:02:22.410> out

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
which is the patch that is coming out

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.700 
which is the patch that is coming out
very<00:02:23.250> soon<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.840> kind<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.440> own<00:02:25.560> it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
very soon I'm kind of if you own it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.620 
very soon I'm kind of if you own it
right<00:02:25.860> now<00:02:26.010> I've<00:02:26.490> seen<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:27.210> negative

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
right now I've seen a lot of negative

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
right now I've seen a lot of negative
stuff<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.110> has<00:02:28.230> come<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> patch<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
stuff that has come with the patch and a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.740 
stuff that has come with the patch and a
lot<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> positive<00:02:30.120> stuff<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> same

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
lot of positive stuff in the same

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
lot of positive stuff in the same
respect<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.890> would<00:02:32.370> say<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.610> negatives

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
respect but I would say the negatives

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.400 
respect but I would say the negatives
outweigh<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.330> positives<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:34.140> now<00:02:34.260> at

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
outweigh the positives right now at

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
outweigh the positives right now at

from<00:02:39.540> experience<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:41.220> from<00:02:41.550> what<00:02:41.610> I've<00:02:41.820> seen

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
from experience but from what I've seen

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
from experience but from what I've seen
the<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> PSC<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.800> definitely<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.850> some

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the on the PSC it's definitely got some

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.640 
the on the PSC it's definitely got some
problems<00:02:45.480> apparently<00:02:45.750> there's<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> triple

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
problems apparently there's a triple

problems apparently there's a triple
kill<00:02:46.890> Street<00:02:47.190> glitch<00:02:47.400> going<00:02:47.700> around<00:02:47.910> where<00:02:48.180> if

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
kill Street glitch going around where if

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.390 
kill Street glitch going around where if
you<00:02:48.450> only<00:02:48.660> set<00:02:48.959> one<00:02:49.140> kill<00:02:49.380> streak<00:02:49.680> you'll<00:02:50.220> get

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you only set one kill streak you'll get

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.330 
you only set one kill streak you'll get
three<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.090> kill<00:02:51.330> streak<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.040> if<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> were

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
three of that kill streak so if you were

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.979 
three of that kill streak so if you were
to<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.700> only<00:02:53.910> set<00:02:54.239> dogs<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.780> would<00:02:54.900> get

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
to just only set dogs you would get

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.420 
to just only set dogs you would get
three<00:02:55.230> sets<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.530> dogs<00:02:55.739> whenever<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.400> in

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.820 
that kill streak which oh man I don't
that<00:02:59.760> sounds<00:03:00.090> pretty<00:03:00.180> bad<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.660> ask<00:03:00.720> me<00:03:01.020> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
that sounds pretty bad if you ask me so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.750 
that sounds pretty bad if you ask me so
um<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:03.470> hope<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.370> doesn't<00:03:05.670> happen

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
um I hope that the that doesn't happen

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
um I hope that the that doesn't happen
in<00:03:05.970> xbox<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.450> don't<00:03:06.600> know<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.959> might<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.290> be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
in xbox I don't know that might just be

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
in xbox I don't know that might just be
a<00:03:07.470> system<00:03:08.160> only<00:03:08.459> coding<00:03:09.030> problem<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.600> it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
a system only coding problem like it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.310 
a system only coding problem like it
might<00:03:09.900> only<00:03:10.050> be<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.940> problem<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.840> my<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.110> know

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
might only be a problem on my you know

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.600 
might only be a problem on my you know
the<00:03:13.470> ps3<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.130> don't<00:03:14.280> know<00:03:14.340> how<00:03:14.550> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
the ps3 because I don't know how the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.090 
the ps3 because I don't know how the
coding<00:03:15.030> works<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.500> hopefully<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.980> not

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
coding works and so hopefully it's not

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.830 
coding works and so hopefully it's not
an<00:03:17.220> issue<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.640> Xbox<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.330> we'll<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.660> that

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
an issue on the Xbox and we'll get that

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.380 
an issue on the Xbox and we'll get that
patch<00:03:19.080> out<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.470> no<00:03:19.620> problems<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:21.090> is

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
patch out with no problems but if it is

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.729 
patch out with no problems but if it is
going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> be<00:03:21.840> an<00:03:21.959> issue<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.230> hope<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.590> don't

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
going to be an issue I hope they don't

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.050 
going to be an issue I hope they don't
give<00:03:22.890> us<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> passages<00:03:23.549> for<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.850> sake<00:03:24.030> of

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
give us the passages for the sake of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.430 
give us the passages for the sake of
giving<00:03:24.299> us<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> patch<00:03:24.870> because<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.320> would

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
giving us the patch because that would

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.920 
giving us the patch because that would
be<00:03:25.730> extremely<00:03:26.730> annoying<00:03:27.120> because<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.750> don't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
be extremely annoying because I don't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.180 
be extremely annoying because I don't
want<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.200> patch<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.860> break<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
want a patch it's going to break the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.550 
want a patch it's going to break the
game<00:03:29.570> another<00:03:30.570> one<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> things<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.320> is

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
game another one of the things that is

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.009 
game another one of the things that is
seem<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.459> be<00:03:32.580> plaguing<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.209> new<00:03:33.360> patch<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.870> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
seem to be plaguing the new patch is the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.300 
seem to be plaguing the new patch is the
fact<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:39.390> double<00:03:39.720> kill<00:03:39.959> glitch

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
fact that the the double kill glitch

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.009 
fact that the the double kill glitch
almost<00:03:41.310> lost<00:03:41.730> lost<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.420> words<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
almost lost lost for words there for a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.479 
almost lost lost for words there for a
second<00:03:43.320> but<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:43.769> yeah<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.070> double<00:03:44.220> kill

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
second but like yeah the double kill

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.860 
second but like yeah the double kill
glitch<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.880> basically<00:03:45.239> when<00:03:45.390> after<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.660> kill

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
glitch is basically when after you kill

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300 
glitch is basically when after you kill
somebody<00:03:46.079> if<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.440> go<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.890> him<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.100> knife

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
somebody if you go up to him and knife

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.920 
somebody if you go up to him and knife
their<00:03:47.489> dead<00:03:47.670> body<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.150> they<00:03:48.269> skip<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.720> kill

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
their dead body and they skip the kill

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.780 
their dead body and they skip the kill
cam<00:03:49.110> soon<00:03:49.769> as<00:03:49.920> they<00:03:50.010> spawn<00:03:50.280> into<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.610> game

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
cam soon as they spawn into the game

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.600 
cam soon as they spawn into the game
they<00:03:51.000> will<00:03:51.150> get<00:03:51.269> killed<00:03:51.540> by<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> knife<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:53.250> yeah

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
they will get killed by a knife so yeah

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.190 
they will get killed by a knife so yeah
that<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.329> seems<00:03:54.540> pretty<00:03:54.720> good<00:03:54.840> game

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
that the that seems pretty good game

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.690 
that the that seems pretty good game
breaking<00:03:55.560> I'm<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:55.890> sure<00:03:56.160> what<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.489> criteria

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
breaking I'm not sure what the criteria

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.600 
breaking I'm not sure what the criteria
are<00:03:57.209> for<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.570> thought<00:03:57.840> till<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.440> be<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:59.010> usable

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
are for that thought till I be a usable

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.850 
are for that thought till I be a usable
method<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.720> hopefully<00:04:01.380> that's<00:04:01.560> not<00:04:01.620> an<00:04:01.769> issue

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
method so hopefully that's not an issue

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.060 
method so hopefully that's not an issue
on<00:04:02.040> xbox<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:02.850> well<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.350> don't<00:04:04.680> know<00:04:04.769> overall

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
on xbox as well but I don't know overall

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.610 
on xbox as well but I don't know overall
their<00:04:05.400> nerf<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.970> second<00:04:06.329> chance<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.930> kind

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
their nerf and second chance they kind

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.289 
their nerf and second chance they kind
of<00:04:07.650> change<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.160> recoil<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> little<00:04:08.880> bit<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
of change the recoil a little bit on the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.060 
of change the recoil a little bit on the
70<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.140> which<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.440> think<00:04:10.470> was<00:04:10.709> needed<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
70 for you which I think was needed to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.460 
70 for you which I think was needed to
that<00:04:11.310> certain<00:04:11.579> extent<00:04:11.940> because<00:04:12.660> even<00:04:13.380> though

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that certain extent because even though

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.590 
that certain extent because even though
I<00:04:13.500> had<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.980> has<00:04:14.100> considerable<00:04:14.910> drop<00:04:15.180> off<00:04:15.390> with

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
I had it has considerable drop off with

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.009 
I had it has considerable drop off with
rapid<00:04:15.930> fire<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.320> still<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> very<00:04:18.019> usable

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
rapid fire it's still a very usable

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.719 
rapid fire it's still a very usable
weapon<00:04:19.410> from<00:04:19.620> long<00:04:19.859> range<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.549> it's<00:04:20.669> a

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
weapon from long range and it's a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.430 
weapon from long range and it's a
submachine<00:04:21.239> gun<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.049> don't<00:04:22.229> really<00:04:22.349> think

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
submachine gun so I don't really think

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.860 
submachine gun so I don't really think
that<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.830> should<00:04:23.010> be<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.220> case<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:24.419> was

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that that should be the case I was

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.240 
that that should be the case I was
hoping<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.169> they<00:04:25.380> would<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.560> instead<00:04:26.190> of

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
hoping that they would just instead of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.930 
hoping that they would just instead of
just<00:04:26.460> Murphy

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
just Murphy

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.220 
just Murphy
the<00:04:27.030> actual<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:29.730> know<00:04:29.850> recoil<00:04:30.390> or<00:04:30.690> like<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
the actual you know recoil or like the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.870 
the actual you know recoil or like the
damage<00:04:31.770> on<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:31.980> gun<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.370> hoping<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.700> they

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
damage on the gun I was hoping that they

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.860 
damage on the gun I was hoping that they
would<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.210> go<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.720> maybe<00:04:33.870> Northey<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
would just go in and maybe Northey the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.150 
would just go in and maybe Northey the
magazine<00:04:37.320> clip<00:04:37.500> because<00:04:37.620> i<00:04:37.770> think<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.040> would

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
magazine clip because i think that would

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.890 
magazine clip because i think that would
balance<00:04:38.670> rapid<00:04:39.210> fire<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.390> little<00:04:39.690> bit<00:04:39.780> better

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
balance rapid fire a little bit better

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.840 
balance rapid fire a little bit better
but<00:04:40.290> alas<00:04:41.010> they<00:04:41.280> chose<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.520> go<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.790> different

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
but alas they chose to go a different

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.730 
but alas they chose to go a different
route<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.450> I'm<00:04:42.630> not<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> game<00:04:43.050> developer<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:43.710> i

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
route and I'm not a game developer so i

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.200 
route and I'm not a game developer so i
can't<00:04:44.040> really<00:04:44.100> criticize<00:04:44.640> them<00:04:44.850> i'm<00:04:45.030> sure

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
can't really criticize them i'm sure

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.550 
can't really criticize them i'm sure
they<00:04:45.360> had<00:04:45.510> their<00:04:45.660> reasons<00:04:45.810> for<00:04:46.110> what<00:04:46.350> they<00:04:46.500> did

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
they had their reasons for what they did

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.230 
they had their reasons for what they did
and<00:04:47.630> yeah<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.020> i<00:04:49.050> think<00:04:49.320> that<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.680> magazine

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and yeah but i think that the magazine

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.010 
and yeah but i think that the magazine
nerf<00:04:51.240> would<00:04:51.480> have<00:04:51.570> been<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.720> lot<00:04:51.750> better

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
nerf would have been a lot better

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.410 
nerf would have been a lot better
because<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.980> would<00:04:53.160> have<00:04:53.310> balanced<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.090> rapid

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
because it would have balanced the rapid

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.180 
because it would have balanced the rapid
fire<00:04:54.600> attachment<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.920> would<00:04:56.040> have<00:04:56.130> made

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
fire attachment it would have made

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.600 
fire attachment it would have made
things<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.550> lot<00:04:56.700> different<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:59.010> yeah<00:04:59.160> anyways

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
things a lot different but yeah anyways

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.400 
things a lot different but yeah anyways
