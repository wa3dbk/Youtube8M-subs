00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:00.840 

we<00:00:51.140> have<00:00:52.809> some<00:00:53.809> spare<00:00:54.170> screws

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:11.620 

we<00:01:01.390> got<00:01:01.570> wheels<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:03.760> nice<00:01:04.120> very<00:01:04.570> fit

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:22.200 

and<00:01:12.049> of<00:01:12.229> course<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.619> bearings

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.380 

yeah

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.600 

of<00:01:26.630> course<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.260> bearings<00:01:27.650> go<00:01:27.950> inside<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
of course the bearings go inside the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:40.250 
of course the bearings go inside the
wheels

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.690 

just<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.920 

it's<00:01:47.700> time<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.120> ahead<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.479> install<00:01:48.780> these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it's time to go ahead and install these

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's time to go ahead and install these
onto<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> wheel<00:01:49.500> bar<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.550> do<00:01:50.729> is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
onto the wheel bar all I have to do is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
onto the wheel bar all I have to do is
undo<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.450> screws<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.140> hold<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.950> old

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
undo the screws that hold in the old

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270 
undo the screws that hold in the old
wheels<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.740> comparison

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
wheels and there's a good comparison

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
wheels and there's a good comparison
between<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.760> two<00:01:56.790> as<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.690> can<00:01:57.840> tell<00:01:58.050> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
between the two as you can tell the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.620 
between the two as you can tell the
plastic<00:01:58.650> stock<00:01:58.890> ones<00:01:59.190> are<00:01:59.490> much<00:01:59.940> smaller<00:02:00.240> than

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
plastic stock ones are much smaller than

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.750 
plastic stock ones are much smaller than
the<00:02:00.990> blue<00:02:01.170> aluminum<00:02:01.619> ones<00:02:01.830> not<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.550> mention

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
the blue aluminum ones not to mention

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760 
the blue aluminum ones not to mention
these<00:02:03.180> are<00:02:03.240> heavier<00:02:03.690> than<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.080> plastic<00:02:04.530> ones

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
these are heavier than the plastic ones

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.219 
these are heavier than the plastic ones
which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.729> surprising<00:02:06.330> but<00:02:06.960> enough

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
which is a bit surprising but enough

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.620 
which is a bit surprising but enough
talk<00:02:07.470> let's<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.890> ahead<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> put<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
talk let's go ahead and put these on

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.940 
talk let's go ahead and put these on
there<00:02:09.630> they<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.200> blue<00:02:10.380> aluminum<00:02:10.800> wheel

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
there they are the blue aluminum wheel

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
there they are the blue aluminum wheel
is<00:02:11.160> meant<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> wheelie<00:02:11.970> bar<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.870> tire

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
is meant for the wheelie bar the tire

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.080 
is meant for the wheelie bar the tire
for<00:02:13.470> these<00:02:13.620> wheels<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:14.310> made<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.640> rubber<00:02:14.820> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
for these wheels are made of rubber of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
for these wheels are made of rubber of
course<00:02:15.390> which<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> very<00:02:16.380> nice<00:02:16.620> feature<00:02:16.920> and
