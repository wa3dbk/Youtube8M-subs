00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 and before starting the answer, I recommend to you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:22.160
 do nothing i just sit and everybody 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 previous and channel with you again colt and 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 this again this is another review of may 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 mechanism and so this time this 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 mechanism to give a new mob to the mastercraft 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.710
 more precisely a turtle and as we see here at 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.930
 here is a turtle as we see a whole here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.070
 turtle 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.469
 that is, here it is usually a turtle 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 you can also push it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.140
 have she 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.489
 she walks but very guys can 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 Now here is how it goes very slowly 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.530
 very much if there is any 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.120
 a barrier is defined then she cannot 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.460
 get around either but she may be and if he 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.980
 if so smart here it is 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.340
 turtle 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.260
 my candle is nonsense and so also 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 and by the way, then it is through the blocks through 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.620
 semi-blocks she stupidly goes through 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.300
 demigods 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.280
 the test here is how we see it passes 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.270
 through the demigods then it is practically 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.410
 unreal but it is so know this is dangerous 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.160
 turtle here you can see that she 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.440
 goes through the demigods and so actually 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.220
 Here such a turtle adds my 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.450
 regular mechanism and so guys let's 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.660
 let's see how he is there how she is 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.020
 works and so it works in simple 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.990
 the film is so by the way now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.650
 You can also push and kill 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.220
 well 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 hit her if you pierce the shell, you can 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.030
 it is necessary to try to poke it 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.910
 yet its the ring 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 so here and I loved okay me 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 were considered too strong and so 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.379
 proper 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.099
 and by the way would give what to call this 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:27.969
 the bug we need everything created so that it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:33.579
 called through a turtle egg 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:36.760
 so here you create and she finds so here 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:40.750
 several can get up and they all walk and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 I have fps down to how we are 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.659
 they bypass them really even though they they still 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.659
 and stop . 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.950
 now I kill them all everything is ready so 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.139
 guys for crooked let's actually 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.290
 let's see how it works so well 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:05.500
 when we call it really 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.350
 have an egg call 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.900
 dogs if you could already notice what 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.020
 first call the dog and actually 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.069
 then he invoked in Tartu and so so 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.239
 everything and so 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.180
 This command block adds gives 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.599
 the effect is an immediate dog sim with 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.569
 the name of the portal, that is, he must 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.650
 why does she seem to walk slowly she 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.650
 leaves very slowly 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 how she she in my case she also she 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:47.310
 does not want okay so it is given to him 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:50.639
 slowness force 5 so on one 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.549
 second force 5 builds it hide 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.459
 particles but if you write rock the sky 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.590
 particles but the mechanism to hide the clean 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.189
 effect this command block adds 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.650
 tawaf have dogs have seeds what effect 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:10.530
 invisibility if you disable these here 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.109
 these two to a monoblock then here's about all 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.780
 the body looks like this 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:19.919
 very soon agree very old and 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.359
 so 5k include and not just three words and 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.789
 So 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.509
 this command block it allows the dog 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.939
 jump if under a dog in such here 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.789
 the coordinates found then his Odessa 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.319
 teleports along the same lines 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.099
 here's the coordinator so she didn't jump 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:42.449
 further this command block is already being created 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:45.270
 Armagh stand head out this is head through 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.349
 you can pass through it 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.349
 see at home 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.789
 Savitar can and over head that is 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:03.689
 armor set find then player head under 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:07.909
 the name is so further in general 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.909
 starting from here to here 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.129
 so in general, then in general, then guys 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:21.789
 now to you to the sword and so this 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.770
 this one this one and this one here 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.909
 The columns that are currently highlighted are answered. 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.409
 for for these here let's say this one 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.889
 cube that is it 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.159
 let's say shell for his legs at the very 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:44.800
 In fact, this carpet Well, now here we say 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:47.050
 bulging bullshit that's all 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.919
 by the way this command block 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.929
 wanted to answer and date also dogs then 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:06:00.219
 There are not dogs but a wolf with a tart 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:06:03.519
 selin 171 he removes the sound of a dog if i 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.600
 schyas turn it on it will be something like here 

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:07.990
 of this 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.990
 So 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.660
 So 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:24.870
 so I read it now see 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.450
 hear yes that is, those are brisk teams 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.750
 turn off the dogs sound that is more accurate 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.020
 disconnects further is strong one disconnect 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.470
 sound 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.520
 owner 1 and so the woman will give birth to it 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.270
 writing a list so that people do not attract 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.060
 her dog 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:47.160
 further so further this command block 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.170
 kellet armor stand relatively from 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.440
 wolf named tartu 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.780
 the difference between the two blocks but to our center 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.220
 on top of each other did not spawn now 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.500
 I will not demonstrate this as mine 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.480
 I can fly all the guys on this 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.440
 and ending your colt here you 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.370
 Like this cute turtle 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.650
 honey she asks to put like 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.160
 I think I think 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:21.110
 Like before 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.110
 good luck everyone guys all bye
