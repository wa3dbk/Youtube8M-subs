00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
hey everybody I have been asked this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.940 
hey everybody I have been asked this
question<00:00:06.540> quite<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.930> few<00:00:07.200> times<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.830> thought

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
question quite a few times and I thought

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.370 
question quite a few times and I thought
I'd<00:00:08.100> do<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.790> quick<00:00:08.970> video<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.720> and<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
I'd do a very quick video on it and the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.039 
I'd do a very quick video on it and the
question<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> why<00:00:11.700> does<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:12.179> nail-polish<00:00:12.599> go

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
question is why does my nail-polish go

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.770 
question is why does my nail-polish go
dull<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.610> only<00:00:15.000> reason<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> can

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
dull and the only reason that I can

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
dull and the only reason that I can
think<00:00:15.959> of<00:00:16.200> is<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.920> must<00:00:17.280> be<00:00:17.490> blowing<00:00:17.970> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
think of is that you must be blowing a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.519 
think of is that you must be blowing a
try<00:00:18.500> with<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.710> mouth<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.279> this

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.410 

now<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.740> blowed<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.310> index<00:00:26.760> finger<00:00:27.210> dry

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and you can see that it has gone a bit

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.440 
and you can see that it has gone a bit
duller<00:00:32.520> than<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.940> other<00:00:33.090> fingers<00:00:38.329> if<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
duller than the other fingers if you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
duller than the other fingers if you
