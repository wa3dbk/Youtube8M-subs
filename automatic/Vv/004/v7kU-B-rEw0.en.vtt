going to show you all of its perks and
when<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> recommend<00:00:20.510> for<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.660> rocket

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
when I recommend for this rocket

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.330 
when I recommend for this rocket
launcher<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> use<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> its<00:00:22.830> full<00:00:22.980> potential

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340

launcher to use to its full potential
i'm<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.449> its<00:00:24.779> upgrades<00:00:25.199> got

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
i'm going to show you its upgrades got

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
i'm going to show you its upgrades got
some<00:00:26.279> are<00:00:26.369> drift<00:00:26.609> control<00:00:26.760> protective

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
some are drift control protective

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
some are drift control protective
uncontrollable<00:00:27.930> recoil<00:00:28.080> penalty<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
uncontrollable recoil penalty to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
velocity high launch more velocity and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
velocity high launch more velocity and
blast<00:00:31.679> radius<00:00:31.920> increase<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.669> recoil<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.620> then

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
blast radius increase to recoil and then

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
blast radius increase to recoil and then
we<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> aggressive<00:00:35.399> launch<00:00:35.670> more

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we have aggressive launch more

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
we have aggressive launch more
predictable<00:00:36.450> recoil<00:00:36.899> enhance<00:00:37.380> blast<00:00:37.710> radius

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.280 
predictable recoil enhance blast radius
reduce<00:00:38.370> velocity<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:39.120> recoil<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:40.170> have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
reduce velocity more recoil they have

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
reduce velocity more recoil they have
clown<00:00:40.500> cartridge<00:00:40.890> tool<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.489> gives<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> a

clown cartridge tool which gives you a
chance<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> larger<00:00:43.200> magazine<00:00:44.000> will

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
chance they get a larger magazine will

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
chance they get a larger magazine will
have<00:00:45.149> job<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.660> which<00:00:45.809> increases<00:00:46.320> warhead

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have job one which increases warhead

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
have job one which increases warhead
velocity<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.600> flared<00:00:48.600> magwell<00:00:48.719> which

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
velocity a flared magwell which

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.860 
velocity a flared magwell which
increases<00:00:49.730> weapon<00:00:50.730> reload<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> lightweight

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
increases weapon reload and lightweight

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
increases weapon reload and lightweight
which<00:00:52.020> increases<00:00:52.469> agility<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.640> have

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
which increases agility then we have

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
which increases agility then we have
this<00:00:54.239> special<00:00:54.420> perk<00:00:54.989> which<00:00:55.620> deals<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> small

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this special perk which deals a small

amount of bonus damage to fall in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
amount of bonus damage to fall in
enemies<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.920> useful<00:00:59.100> in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
enemies which would be very useful in

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.990 
enemies which would be very useful in
the<00:01:00.420> level<00:01:00.719> 35<00:01:01.230> skull<00:01:01.680> loss<00:01:01.890> prison<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.609> elders

the longer I here industry example of
Jacqueline<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.960> huge

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
Jacqueline you're going to want a huge

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
Jacqueline you're going to want a huge
job<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.620> because<00:01:10.800> this<00:01:10.950> weapon<00:01:11.310> starts<00:01:11.640> out

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
job on because this weapon starts out

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.180 
job on because this weapon starts out
with<00:01:11.820> very<00:01:12.090> low<00:01:12.510> velocity<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.740> job<00:01:13.979> will<00:01:14.159> be

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
with very low velocity so job will be

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.430 
with very low velocity so job will be
very<00:01:14.550> useful<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.050> you're<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
very useful to you and you're going to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.430 
very useful to you and you're going to
switch<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.800> flared<00:01:17.130> magwell<00:01:17.690> which<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.960> also

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
switch to flared magwell which is also

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.210 
switch to flared magwell which is also
very<00:01:19.590> useful<00:01:19.710> which<00:01:20.540> like<00:01:21.619> triples<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.770> reload

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
very useful which like triples or reload

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
very useful which like triples or reload
speed<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.630> useful<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
speed which will be very very useful in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.080 
speed which will be very very useful in
certain<00:01:25.860> situations

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
certain situations

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.560 
certain situations

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 

in<00:01:34.230> my<00:01:34.440> opinion<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.340> enjoyed<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
in my opinion I really enjoyed this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880 
in my opinion I really enjoyed this
weapon<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.450> very<00:01:36.630> strong<00:01:37.200> rock<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.770> which

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
weapon it's a very strong rock on which

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
weapon it's a very strong rock on which
are<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.190> good<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> large<00:01:38.940> groups<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
are very good for a large groups of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.860 
are very good for a large groups of
enemies<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:40.020> even<00:01:40.290> bosses<00:01:40.910> however<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.270> think

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
enemies and even bosses however I think

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.460 
enemies and even bosses however I think
it<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.620> lagged<00:01:43.920> behind<00:01:44.160> in<00:01:44.670> PvP<00:01:45.470> its

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it just kind of lagged behind in PvP its

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370 
it just kind of lagged behind in PvP its
velocity<00:01:46.830> isn't<00:01:47.400> as<00:01:47.700> good<00:01:47.940> as<00:01:48.240> leading<00:01:48.780> rocket

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
velocity isn't as good as leading rocket

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.810 
velocity isn't as good as leading rocket
launchers<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.770> doesn't<00:01:50.190> even<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.490> tracking

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
launchers and doesn't even have tracking

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960 
launchers and doesn't even have tracking
like<00:01:51.150> down<00:01:51.330> or<00:01:51.750> truth<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:53.040> you're<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> pvp<00:01:53.790> dear

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
like down or truth if you're a pvp dear

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.670 
like down or truth if you're a pvp dear
I<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.479> honestly<00:01:54.690> stay<00:01:55.170> away<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.440> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I would honestly stay away from this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.330 
I would honestly stay away from this
weapon<00:01:56.070> however<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.150> you<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.450> PvE<00:01:57.869> i<00:01:58.410> would

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
weapon however if you like PvE i would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
weapon however if you like PvE i would
definitely<00:01:59.759> upgrade<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.660> weapon<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.080> its
