life<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> prankster<00:02:11.520> bulk<00:02:11.790> up

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
life you can get the prankster bulk up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.820 
life you can get the prankster bulk up
or<00:02:12.120> prankster<00:02:12.540> rest<00:02:12.780> off

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
or prankster rest off

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
or prankster rest off
go<00:02:13.980> from<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.340> even<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> get<00:02:14.940> paralyzed

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
go from there even if you get paralyzed

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
go from there even if you get paralyzed
for<00:02:15.750> instance<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.530> paralyzed<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
for instance if you get paralyzed you to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.540 
for instance if you get paralyzed you to
rest<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.240> first<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:20.220> useful

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
rest you can go first so that's useful

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.580 
rest you can go first so that's useful
however<00:02:21.090> defiant<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.780> useful<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.290> if

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
however defiant is useful because if

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
however defiant is useful because if
anything<00:02:22.920> comes<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.370> tries<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.820> lower<00:02:23.970> your

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
anything comes in tries to lower your

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
anything comes in tries to lower your
attack<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.170> lowers<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.470> special

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
attack or you know lowers your special

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.740 
attack or you know lowers your special
attack<00:02:26.160> with<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> move<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.210> attack<00:02:27.510> boots

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
attack with a move you can attack boots

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.060 
attack with a move you can attack boots
so<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.560> what<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
so it's up to you and what you want to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.100 
so it's up to you and what you want to
run<00:02:29.250> since<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> more<00:02:30.570> defensively

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
run since this is a more defensively

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.980 
run since this is a more defensively
incline<00:02:31.560> set<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.150> say<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> pranksters

because<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.800> more<00:02:34.980> reliable<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:36.210> it's

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
because it's more reliable but it's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
more defensive set you're going to want

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.510

stealth rocks which ends if need be we

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.190 
stealth rocks which ends if need be we
maxed<00:03:05.550> out<00:03:05.640> speed<00:03:05.970> however<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.870> really

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
maxed out speed however if you really

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.760 
maxed out speed however if you really
wanted<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.890> could<00:03:08.370> max<00:03:08.640> out<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.770> special

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
wanted to you could max out your special

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
attack with a careful nature not special

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.380 
attack with a careful nature not special
attacks<00:03:13.920> special<00:03:14.220> defense<00:03:14.490> with<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> careful

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
attacks special defense with a careful

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.300 
attacks special defense with a careful
nature<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.560> live<00:03:16.709> special<00:03:17.130> hits

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
nature so that you can live special hits

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.070 
nature so that you can live special hits
better<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.760> set<00:03:17.940> up<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.180> florges<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.870> think

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
better and set up on florges I think

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.009 
better and set up on florges I think
florges<00:03:19.620> can't<00:03:19.920> even<00:03:20.130> for<00:03:20.370> hit<00:03:20.519> KO<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.019> with

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
florges can't even for hit KO you with

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.350 
florges can't even for hit KO you with
moonblast<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.239> really

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
moonblast so if you really really really

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.110 
moonblast so if you really really really
want<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.290> go<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.680> more<00:03:25.890> bulky<00:03:26.340> route<00:03:26.610> you

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
want to go the more bulky route you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.750 
want to go the more bulky route you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.660 
totally can um I'm going the speedy
route<00:03:30.060> though<00:03:30.330> with<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.989> timid<00:03:31.590> nature<00:03:31.670> because

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
route though with a timid nature because

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.199 
route though with a timid nature because
um<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:34.380> know<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.400> good<00:03:35.519> mix<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.940> bulk

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
um you know if it's a good mix of bulk

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.270 
um you know if it's a good mix of bulk
and<00:03:36.450> speed<00:03:36.930> because<00:03:37.320> Tornetta<00:03:37.680> sits<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.130> that

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and speed because Tornetta sits in that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.340 
and speed because Tornetta sits in that
base<00:03:38.820> 111<00:03:39.360> speeds<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:39.780> which<00:03:39.959> means<00:03:40.110> it's

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
base 111 speeds here which means it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.650 
base 111 speeds here which means it's
gonna<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:40.890> speed<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> majority<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> things

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
gonna out speed the majority of things

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.920 
gonna out speed the majority of things
so<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.950> choose<00:03:44.459> just<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> invest<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.690> know<00:03:45.810> an

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
but anyway the strategy is to come in on

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.220 
but anyway the strategy is to come in on
something<00:04:28.590> weak<00:04:28.950> like<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> wall<00:04:29.610> maybe<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.570> don't

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
something weak like a wall maybe I don't

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.570 
something weak like a wall maybe I don't
know<00:04:31.790> slowbro<00:04:32.790> or<00:04:33.660> something<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.139> or

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.010 
know slowbro or something like that or
possibly<00:04:35.580> even<00:04:37.730> possibly<00:04:38.730> even<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.870> know<00:04:39.990> a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
possibly even possibly even you know a

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.409 
possibly even possibly even you know a
gorgeous<00:04:40.800> something<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.790> can't<00:04:42.090> really

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
