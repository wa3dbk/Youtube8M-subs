 3rd forum staff the cable car 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.520
 today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.350
 or report 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 with using the ccleaner tool 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.809
 is that if you enable some services 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.150
 thus becoming much easier 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.680
 when you want and well executed this operation go there 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 Let's open the ccleaner. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's see it in tools 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.640
 tools 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.460
 we go beyond programs started as or 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.720
 the canecão on top 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.500
 and here we live 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 everything that is starting with pardon 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.710
 we already know from our own experience 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.040
 that everything with the beginning I went to hide has a lot starting with 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.970
 Windows 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.830
 it gets heavy 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.270
 for example 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.720
 I do not usually say empower 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 I've always done it since my safety. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.300
 how antivirus firewall is opting pirates harvest 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 here we are also coming here for example 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.300
 the bad breath baiti pregnant malá ipma wai 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 he is enabled I use law 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 why there 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.980
 get resident protection in the middle on my system flag 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.240
 and guesses security so it has to stay enabled as it is here in 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.320
 yes 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.470
 but let's give an example for example if I wanted to disable 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 this program of my security by clicking on it 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.860
 I came down here and would click impurity to enable 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.220
 and he would take the word no 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.560
 he would no longer be starting along with my system along with my English 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.240
 this is just to exemplify 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.599
 How do you have other things here, not that I'm well aware that you have 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.730
 Let's go back here and let's enable 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.440
 one hour he'll get you because he's my security then I'll go here 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.349
 I live to disable 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 as well as the single ticket 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 I could also remove input 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.949
 but I do not really like doing this 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.699
 because I might want to enable some add-on again 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.479
 so I'll leave it 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.879
 Enabled I leave here my vidinha video lesson class 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.359
 on this morning 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.949
 so that it can be harnessed 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.819
 in what if the pc forum were thanked 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.769
 Thank you so much until the next
