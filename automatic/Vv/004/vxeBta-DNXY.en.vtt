start repeating notes again I'm going to
give<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> three<00:01:24.270> different<00:01:24.299> techniques<00:01:25.369> or

structures<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.420> try<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.200> give<00:01:28.350> your

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
structures to try to give your

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.460 
structures to try to give your
improvisation<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.759> form<00:01:30.229> first<00:01:31.229> thing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
improvisation a little form first thing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
improvisation a little form first thing
to<00:01:31.590> try<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.810> play<00:01:34.369> long<00:01:35.369> notes<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> bass

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to try is to play long notes in the bass

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
to try is to play long notes in the bass
on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> left<00:01:37.170> hand<00:01:37.439> make<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> melody<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
on the left hand make up a melody in the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.649 
on the left hand make up a melody in the
right<00:01:39.210> hand

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:02:22.089 

a<00:02:18.430> second<00:02:19.430> idea<00:02:19.549> is<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.900> play<00:02:21.110> long<00:02:21.470> notes<00:02:21.799> the

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
a second idea is to play long notes the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.309 
a second idea is to play long notes the
right<00:02:22.310> hand<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.269> make<00:02:23.540> up<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.810> melody<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
right hand and make up a melody in the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.680 
right hand and make up a melody in the
left<00:02:24.590> hand<00:02:24.970> they'll<00:02:25.970> probably<00:02:26.180> want<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.540> use

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
left hand they'll probably want to use

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.309 
left hand they'll probably want to use
less<00:02:26.989> pedal<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.370> one<00:02:28.660> because<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.019> sound

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
less pedal on this one because the sound

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.140 
less pedal on this one because the sound
can<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> little<00:02:30.920> more<00:02:31.040> muddied<00:02:31.459> with<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
can get a little more muddied with the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:52.740 
can get a little more muddied with the
bass<00:02:32.329> notes

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:10.590 

a<00:03:06.390> third<00:03:07.390> idea<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.860> play<00:03:09.070> long<00:03:09.730> notes<00:03:10.090> again

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
a third idea is to play long notes again

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.580 
a third idea is to play long notes again
in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> bass<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> right<00:03:12.400> hand<00:03:13.590> with

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
in the bass and in the right hand with

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.830 
in the bass and in the right hand with
your<00:03:14.770> melody<00:03:15.190> line<00:03:15.400> try<00:03:15.970> mixing<00:03:16.270> in<00:03:16.600> some

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
your melody line try mixing in some

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.640 
your melody line try mixing in some
