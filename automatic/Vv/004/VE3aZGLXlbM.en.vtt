make of that win Steve I want you make
of<00:00:32.149> way<00:00:32.270> at<00:00:32.390> least<00:00:32.480> Portsmouth<00:00:33.050> do<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.199> think

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
of way at least Portsmouth do you think

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.630 
of way at least Portsmouth do you think
they've<00:00:33.469> got<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.770> fighting<00:00:34.039> chance<00:00:34.219> now

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
they've got a fighting chance now

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.700 
they've got a fighting chance now
against<00:00:35.030> teams<00:00:35.359> like<00:00:35.449> Portsmouth<00:00:36.020> that's<00:00:36.530> so

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
against teams like Portsmouth that's so

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.930 
against teams like Portsmouth that's so
against<00:00:36.980> teams<00:00:37.190> like<00:00:37.280> top<00:00:37.550> them<00:00:37.670> up<00:00:37.760> using

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
against teams like top them up using

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.219 
against teams like top them up using
firm<00:00:38.359> I<00:00:40.179> think<00:00:41.179> possibly<00:00:41.569> because<00:00:41.870> toddler

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
firm I think possibly because toddler

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.630 
firm I think possibly because toddler
got<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:42.499> or<00:00:42.589> two<00:00:42.739> well<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:43.100> mean<00:00:43.280> whether<00:00:43.489> or

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
got one or two well I mean whether or

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.340 
got one or two well I mean whether or
not<00:00:43.699> Defoe's<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.300> I<00:00:44.449> would<00:00:44.719> imagine<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.109> def

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
not Defoe's it I would imagine that def

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.169 
not Defoe's it I would imagine that def
I<00:00:45.469> would<00:00:45.710> would<00:00:45.979> play<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.249> this<00:00:46.429> would<00:00:46.879> be<00:00:46.969> mr.

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
I would would play in this would be mr.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.930 
I would would play in this would be mr.
England<00:00:47.539> going<00:00:48.309> moderate<00:00:49.309> chop<00:00:49.460> see<00:00:49.639> makes<00:00:49.819> a

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
England going moderate chop see makes a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.189 
England going moderate chop see makes a
huge<00:00:50.120> difference<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:50.749> so<00:00:50.960> there<00:00:51.079> is

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
huge difference in so there is

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.069 
huge difference in so there is
definitely<00:00:51.229> a<00:00:52.839> susceptibility<00:00:53.839> of

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
definitely a susceptibility of

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.049 
definitely a susceptibility of
vulnerability<00:00:54.920> disperse<00:00:55.339> that<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.969> know

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
vulnerability disperse that you know

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.399 
vulnerability disperse that you know
there<00:00:56.329> otherwise<00:00:56.569> probably<00:00:56.989> wouldn't<00:00:57.319> have

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
there otherwise probably wouldn't have

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.000 
there otherwise probably wouldn't have
been<00:00:57.670> sent<00:00:58.670> half<00:00:59.319> Dawson<00:01:00.319> might<00:01:00.469> be<00:01:00.620> fit<00:01:00.829> but

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
been sent half Dawson might be fit but

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.989 
been sent half Dawson might be fit but
they're<00:01:01.129> they're<00:01:01.280> certainly<00:01:01.549> struggling<00:01:01.940> in

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
they're they're certainly struggling in

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.500 
they're they're certainly struggling in
that<00:01:02.120> respect<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:03.350> or<00:01:03.440> two<00:01:03.620> so<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.510> think

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
that respect one or two so I think

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.600 
that respect one or two so I think
undoubtedly<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> game<00:01:06.799> where<00:01:07.040> you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
undoubtedly this is a game where you

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.730 
undoubtedly this is a game where you
know<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:08.290> you'd<00:01:09.290> like<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.530> think<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
know what you'd like to think the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.190 
know what you'd like to think the
Portsmouth<00:01:10.130> meal<00:01:10.570> I've<00:01:11.570> got<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> little<00:01:11.990> bit<00:01:12.170> of

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
Portsmouth meal I've got a little bit of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.450 
Portsmouth meal I've got a little bit of
confidence<00:01:12.500> in<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.860> game<00:01:13.070> they're<00:01:13.280> going<00:01:13.370> to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
confidence in the game they're going to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.760 
confidence in the game they're going to
go<00:01:13.550> after<00:01:13.580> Tottenham<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.420> own<00:01:14.570> before<00:01:15.380> before

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
go after Tottenham you own before before

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.560 
go after Tottenham you own before before
this<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.520> last<00:01:16.730> couple<00:01:16.940> of<00:01:17.060> weeks<00:01:17.270> you'd<00:01:17.480> have

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
this the last couple of weeks you'd have

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.120 
this the last couple of weeks you'd have
thought<00:01:17.690> taught<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.140> ports<00:01:18.860> have<00:01:18.920> would<00:01:19.100> have

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
thought taught the ports have would have

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.070 
thought taught the ports have would have
gone<00:01:19.310> for<00:01:19.400> 51<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.270> tried<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.540> close<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.900> game

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
always a bit a little bit vulnerable

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.000 
always a bit a little bit vulnerable
when<00:01:40.760> they've<00:01:40.910> got<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.150> ball<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.770> hairy

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
when they've got the ball and the hairy

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.210 
when they've got the ball and the hairy
mix<00:01:43.340> will<00:01:44.300> applies<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:45.440> fro<00:01:45.650> in<00:01:45.680> after

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
mix will applies to and fro in after

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.580 
mix will applies to and fro in after
their<00:01:46.370> yeah<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.120> makes<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.020> very
