 Placements prove 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.710
 In addition, there was only one very special for the 21-year-old 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.429

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
 Tens play winning including a double-digit jump 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.790
 other 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.140
 are still struggling with fifty at the age of 50 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.120

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.050
 Percent nice feeling 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.210
 the thanks of a ball of only 14 years to the equestrian can be considered especially 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 with one person 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.000
 then you will almost say 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.180
 Bussmann say percent as a lot of different ferry could ride 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.570
 could always better adjust to it 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 and thereby have learned a lot left 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.940
 then, relatively quickly, only the other people have the option 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.720

 So we would like to take this with us in the next few years 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.409
 have trained 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.540
 the so successful are also elsewhere in their drive but every base work 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.760
 have recorded 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.550
 from the toddler to the Springer residents and visitors 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.139
 the final category m jump the last of a total of 41 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.629
 Christian Neubecker was able to test for himself this weekend 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.649
 decide 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.569
 the rider from Reitverein Osterwick sat on ancestors against the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.419
 Competitors through 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.899
 the conclusion of a successful event 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.099
 First Chairman Wolfgang Einck drew a positive summary especially what the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.229
 Quality of the state 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:49.019
 Ahlmann notes that the quality and zeal of the fairways overall 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.540
 has become much better that has looked different years ago, me 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.239
 think a new one could endanger it with only then qualities are better 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.049
 who can expect even more from the young show jumper Hendrik Dowe 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.150
 the balance speaks for itself 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.350
