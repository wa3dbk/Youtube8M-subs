day<00:00:53.650> I<00:00:54.299> noticed<00:00:55.299> this<00:00:55.629> that's<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.170> ground

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
day I noticed this that's in the ground

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.549 
day I noticed this that's in the ground
on<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.619> side<00:00:56.890> obviously<00:00:58.470> but<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:02.140> actually

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
on one side obviously but it's actually

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.940
