00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
bit because of the fact that I actually

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
bit because of the fact that I actually
made<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> Titan<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:43.890> day<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.270> only
