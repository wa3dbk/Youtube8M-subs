00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.200
 we see a greenwheel and me here 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.660
 am at the booth of mtb cycletech that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 greenwheel was developed by and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.269
 Now is in this bike 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.170
 how come it is purely by chance 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.869
 I met the engineers 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.869
 the green will have developed on one front 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.000
 three years and the green was in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.090
 connection with the project smart city 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 is a subproject what it's about that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 the whole city and the inhabitants and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.700
 involve the movement together 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.200
 must be in the future also a just 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.230
 intelligent city ​​can arise 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.450
 and now we see it here like I have to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 imagine what's in the back 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.100
 the very prominent scar so we 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.620
 always say roll time and great 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.140
 time we mean that in here 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 the electronics is it is also one 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 electric motor as is the motor in it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.780
 and the energy will be sitting in one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.120
 battery and is still in it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 it's all in there it takes one more 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.420
 button and press the button of the kreml 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.670
 activated where you can drive 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 and what makes the bike different? 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.600
 the integrated greenwheel of others 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.770
 normal e bikes that the screen wants 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.649
 a normal bike to an electric bike 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.780
 So you do not need an electric bike 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.060
 but you need but you need one 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 Electroad more accurate you only need one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.160
 electromechanical rear wheel and how they composed 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.090
 with future vision to the wheel 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.479
 what can s times so if one 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 Famous university like the rp at one 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.410
 Project is involved then always 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.520
 developed great visions and the 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.229
 vision here may be 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 At some point, all people no longer 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250
 have enough space to subcut themselves 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.670
 getting around 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.340
 but if they move on then 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.250
 one wants in there and when I say 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.350
 a dremel then it's the ultimate 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.310
 vision that we are on the unicycle, so to speak 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.310
 to be born 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.220
 bluetooth is in it or should be in it 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.290
 What am I doing with bluetooth? 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.410
 bluetooth can then be communicated 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.560
 and actually seen this wheel 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.190
 as you saw the smartphone 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.530
 has been 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.190
 it could telephone and also a lot 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.170
 other 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.050
 for most people it was a portal 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.850
 Phone today especially for the young 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.750
 people is the phone to the incident 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.310
 become 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.720
 blood is just a technology around 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 to communicate wirelessly and that can 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.709
 actually that too so one says that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.209
 this wheel from canvas today 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.680
 smartphone can and he's the biggest 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.850
 behaves selfishly, it behaves 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.870
 energy saving it will be nothing else 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.019
 as little as possible of its battery 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.910
 output capacity so say it 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.220
 you have to go through it with it 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.769
 Energy saving is there and not where 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.420
 you have to go through it now and then 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.910
 you will be pushed up the mountain 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.299
 if you have enough juice you push 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.670
 by felix elsterberg but if you 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.700
 do not know how you get to the goal 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.010
 the direct test away says it's the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.860
 considering that it is possible 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 I arrive soft and energy saving 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 Thank you for the interview
