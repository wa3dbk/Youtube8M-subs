it in there we're going to use some

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.830 
it in there we're going to use some
secret<00:01:04.670> sauce<00:01:04.969> as<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.359> called<00:01:05.569> it<00:01:05.689> some

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
it slide a lot better on your edge so we

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.590 
it slide a lot better on your edge so we
just<00:01:16.729> put<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.939> couple<00:01:17.389> of<00:01:17.600> squirts<00:01:17.899> in<00:01:18.109> there

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
just put a couple of squirts in there

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.569 
just put a couple of squirts in there
right<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.719> there<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.979> once<00:01:22.189> again<00:01:22.310> we're

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
right in there and once again we're

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.709 
right in there and once again we're
going<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.729> start<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.149> at<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.329> tip<00:01:23.569> of<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
into the center of the ski and then

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.840 
into the center of the ski and then
proceed<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.920> tail

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.730

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.249 
going to go through a diamond stone grit
progression<00:02:07.090> that's<00:02:07.390> fine<00:02:07.690> but<00:02:07.900> if<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.050> plan

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
progression that's fine but if you plan

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.680 
progression that's fine but if you plan
on<00:02:08.380> moving<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:09.009> some<00:02:09.729> ceramic<00:02:10.209> stones<00:02:10.450> or

some polishing stones you probably just

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.330 
some polishing stones you probably just
need<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.790> accomplish<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.630> 400<00:02:14.170> grit<00:02:14.320> just<00:02:15.220> like

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.370 
and polish the edge so that it's very
smooth<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.980> so<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.790> cuts<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.930> common

they're turning their skis is to feel

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.290 
they're turning their skis is to feel
the<00:04:28.940> ski<00:04:29.510> as<00:04:29.840> such<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.830> say<00:04:31.280> wow<00:04:31.970> that's

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
the ski as such and say wow that's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.600 
the ski as such and say wow that's
really<00:04:32.600> sharp<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.770> that's<00:04:33.980> actually<00:04:34.160> not<00:04:34.550> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
really sharp but that's actually not the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.000 
really sharp but that's actually not the
truth<00:04:35.170> commonly<00:04:36.170> when<00:04:36.320> people<00:04:36.620> do<00:04:36.830> this

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
truth commonly when people do this

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.740 
truth commonly when people do this
there's<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.370> burr<00:04:37.670> that's<00:04:37.970> been<00:04:38.120> formed<00:04:38.420> on<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
there's a burr that's been formed on the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.310 
there's a burr that's been formed on the
edge<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:40.400> not<00:04:40.610> smooth<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:41.900> actually

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
edge and it's not smooth it's actually

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920 
edge and it's not smooth it's actually
very<00:04:42.470> harsh<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.790> when<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.300> form<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.750> very

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
very harsh so when you form a very

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.550 
very harsh so when you form a very
smooth<00:04:45.410> edge<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:46.250> cuts<00:04:46.610> into<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.000> snow<00:04:47.560> ice

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
smooth edge it cuts into the snow ice

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.670 
smooth edge it cuts into the snow ice
more<00:04:49.040> specifically<00:04:49.670> much<00:04:50.390> easier<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.170> much

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
more specifically much easier and much

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.470 
more specifically much easier and much
smoother<00:04:52.220> leaving<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.090> ability<00:04:53.270> to

smoother leaving you the ability to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.250 
smoother leaving you the ability to
control<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.080> ski<00:04:54.290> through<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.710> turns<00:04:55.780> now<00:04:56.780> we

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
control the ski through the turns now we

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.760 
control the ski through the turns now we
can<00:04:57.410> use<00:04:57.560> each<00:04:57.740> one<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:58.130> these<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.490> progression

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
can use each one of these in progression

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.660

does a couple things

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.850 
does a couple things
once<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.120> keeps<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.390> stones<00:05:50.630> clean<00:05:50.930> lets<00:05:51.740> it

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
once it keeps the stones clean lets it

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.830 
once it keeps the stones clean lets it
slide<00:05:52.100> a<00:05:52.160> lot<00:05:52.370> better<00:05:52.600> producing<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.690> higher

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
slide a lot better producing a higher

finish a couple squirts on there once
again<00:06:00.410> just<00:06:01.040> like<00:06:01.070> we've<00:06:01.310> done<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:01.490> several

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
again just like we've done in several

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.520 
again just like we've done in several
other<00:06:02.000> progressions<00:06:02.630> so<00:06:02.810> we're<00:06:03.140> gonna<00:06:03.230> start

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
other progressions so we're gonna start

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.670 
other progressions so we're gonna start
at<00:06:03.590> the<00:06:03.620> tip<00:06:07.840> working<00:06:08.840> in<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:08.990> mid<00:06:09.170> section<00:06:09.440> of

at the tip working in the mid section of

at the tip working in the mid section of
the<00:06:09.740> ski<00:06:11.350> and<00:06:12.490> work<00:06:13.490> into<00:06:13.760> the<00:06:13.790> tail<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.240> the

the ski and work into the tail of the
ski

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.480 

to<00:06:19.449> start<00:06:19.749> making<00:06:20.050> nice<00:06:20.259> long<00:06:20.589> passes<00:06:21.159> you

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
to start making nice long passes you

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.209 
to start making nice long passes you
shouldn't<00:06:21.849> be<00:06:21.909> able<00:06:22.059> to<00:06:22.149> hear<00:06:23.219> anything
