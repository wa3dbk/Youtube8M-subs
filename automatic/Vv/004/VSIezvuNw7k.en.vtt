that<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> fragments<00:00:29.910> we're<00:00:30.029> gonna

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that some of the fragments we're gonna

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.939 
that some of the fragments we're gonna
start<00:00:30.390> falling<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
start falling out and that would that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.650 
start falling out and that would that
would<00:00:32.009> definitely<00:00:32.369> cause<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> problem<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
would definitely cause a problem so I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930
