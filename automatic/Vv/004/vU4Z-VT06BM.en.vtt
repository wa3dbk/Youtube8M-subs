00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and then dry it and so that when we glue

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.190 
and then dry it and so that when we glue
the<00:03:11.610> label<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.210> doesn't<00:03:12.510> get<00:03:12.600> all<00:03:12.750> sticky

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the label on it doesn't get all sticky

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.540 
the label on it doesn't get all sticky
and<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.620> don't<00:03:13.800> want<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> label<00:03:14.250> because

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
and you don't want the label because

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.720 
and you don't want the label because
it's<00:03:14.670> paper<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.180> get<00:03:15.300> wet<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.400> there's<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's paper to get wet so there's the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.910 
it's paper to get wet so there's the
label<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.360> can't<00:03:18.630> also<00:03:18.780> print<00:03:19.290> off<00:03:19.380> the
