00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
here we didn't have any any time that we
had<00:00:22.949> wandered<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> game<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.750> very

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
had wandered the game so I was very

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.170 
had wandered the game so I was very
difficulty<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.189> knew<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.970> sit
