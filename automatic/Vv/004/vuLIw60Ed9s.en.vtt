okay<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.949> getting<00:00:02.040> into<00:00:02.520> mole<00:00:03.510> conversions

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
okay we're getting into mole conversions

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.709 
okay we're getting into mole conversions
in<00:00:05.810> in<00:00:06.810> these<00:00:07.259> questions<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.950> chemistry<00:00:08.429> you

thing here let me just get rid of that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.160 
thing here let me just get rid of that
stuff

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
stuff

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
stuff
what<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> mole<00:01:10.590> there's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.640> scientist<00:01:12.030> named

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
what is a mole there's a scientist named

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
what is a mole there's a scientist named
out<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> God<00:01:12.689> role<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> navigator<00:01:13.650> Oh<00:01:13.860> found

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
out of God role of a navigator Oh found

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
out of God role of a navigator Oh found
that<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.450> mole<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.290> substance<00:01:17.750> can<00:01:18.750> contains

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that a mole of substance can contains

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.480 
that a mole of substance can contains
exactly<00:01:21.409> 6.02<00:01:22.430> times<00:01:23.430> 10<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.320> 23rd<00:01:25.490> atoms

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.710 

per<00:01:32.490> mole<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.150> what's<00:01:36.390> known<00:01:36.540> as

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
per mole and this is what's known as

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.370 
per mole and this is what's known as
Avogadro's<00:01:37.470> number

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.880 

so<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.710> use<00:01:47.950> our<00:01:48.310> goggle<00:01:48.820> number<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:50.439> we

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
so we can use our goggle number if we

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.560 
so we can use our goggle number if we
want<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.460> know<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:53.320> number<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:54.210> options<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
want to know the number of options the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.889 
want to know the number of options the
number<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:55.990> molecules<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> some<00:02:01.600> running

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
number of molecules and some running

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
number of molecules and some running
number<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.229> molecules<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.420> moles<00:02:04.420> here

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.790 

so<00:02:09.940> if<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.239> have<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> question<00:02:11.019> that<00:02:11.050> where

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
so if you have a question that where

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.589 
so if you have a question that where
you're<00:02:12.010> getting<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.700> number<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.150> Molech

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
you're getting the number of Molech

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.170 
you're getting the number of Molech
molecules<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.410> ask<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.800> how<00:02:15.040> many<00:02:15.280> moles<00:02:15.730> is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
molecules and ask you how many moles is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.559 
molecules and ask you how many moles is
that<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.430> calculate<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.000> these

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
that you can calculate it these

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.080 
that you can calculate it these
triangles<00:02:20.200> your<00:02:20.319> way<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> represent<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.910> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
triangles your way to represent just to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.250

to<00:03:04.090> calculate<00:03:04.980> molecular<00:03:05.980> molar<00:03:06.700> mass<00:03:07.380> by

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to calculate molecular molar mass by

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.059 
to calculate molecular molar mass by
adding<00:03:08.769> up<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.430> atomic<00:03:09.730> masses<00:03:10.109> of<00:03:11.109> each<00:03:11.530> atom

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
adding up the atomic masses of each atom

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.300 
adding up the atomic masses of each atom
type<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.299> compound<00:03:14.100> okay

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
type in a compound okay

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.599 
type in a compound okay
so<00:03:16.120> again<00:03:16.389> if<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.680> mass<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.310> grams

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
so again if you know the mass and grams

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.150 
so again if you know the mass and grams
of<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> substance<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:19.810> divide<00:03:20.260> by<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
of the substance you can divide by the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.729 
of the substance you can divide by the
molecular<00:03:22.000> mass<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:23.709> find<00:03:24.040> moles<00:03:25.739> gather

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
molecular mass to find moles gather

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.190 
molecular mass to find moles gather
around<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.579> moles<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
around if you know moles and the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.809 
around if you know moles and the
molecular<00:03:29.440> mass<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.370> break<00:03:30.579> your<00:03:30.700> way

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
molecular mass you can break your way

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.479 
molecular mass you can break your way
back<00:03:31.650> defining<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.769> mass<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.430> grams<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489
