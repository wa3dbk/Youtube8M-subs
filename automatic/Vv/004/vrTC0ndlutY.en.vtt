00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.110
 sunflower field after winter wheat 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.110
 pool field 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 in the fall they also processed it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:25.320
 Seen Cree front Ibiza ladies two liters 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 somewhere around 600 rubles per hectare in the spring to 1 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.460
 May was sow falcon 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.329
 the sunflower here is the seeding rate of 75 thousand 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.360
 was made 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:45.930
 seventy five kilos you nitro boron and here 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 on product quality by acidity 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.340
 she gave good 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 results 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 it means there was added plant nutrition 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 and I will still check against the root 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.360
 rot your bacterial drugs 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 did not work just 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.570
 I liked not katsy still done 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.430
 sunflower but that worked fikatsii 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.160
 gelika if liter and plus atlanta field 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.590
 purely because of this we don’t even 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.340
 make light den work for me 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.230
 because carrick rut still pulled 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.280
 extra food food sat down 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:36.130
 leaves in it took new where so the field 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:41.440
 after 0 if there was 1. May 6 May 6 rain 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.490
 there was here and on May 26 the 2 equity holders were then not 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.840
 it was with so generally still no 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.650
 despite this due to but 0 technology 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 cracks in the fields you do not notice even here 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.830
 these 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.570
 this is the result of the work here and the soil that we 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.869
 for many years he did n’t work swim 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.570
 already the layer is saved but even you see 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.440
 what is it straw 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.580
 winter wheat was supposed to rot 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.100
 because you are missing in our zone 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 heavy precipitation 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.820
 must overheat it still persists 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.239
 too, water is not enough sight to layer 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.519
 on the layer remains he dynaxer 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.519
 the future of course for the new technology
