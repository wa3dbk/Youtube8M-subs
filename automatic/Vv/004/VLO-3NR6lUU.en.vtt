00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
it and later we're going to figure out

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.900 
it and later we're going to figure out
how<00:02:52.700> many<00:02:52.760> individual<00:02:53.510> packages<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.910> beef

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
this makes because you think your first

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.910 
this makes because you think your first
seven<00:02:58.610> dollars<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.960> can<00:02:59.990> probably<00:03:00.710> get<00:03:00.890> i

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
seven dollars you can probably get i

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.850 
seven dollars you can probably get i
would<00:03:01.160> think<00:03:01.660> maybe<00:03:02.660> six<00:03:03.020> different<00:03:03.680> meals

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860

let's go through the economics of it I

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.540 
let's go through the economics of it I
already<00:04:46.350> have<00:04:46.530> cleaned<00:04:46.830> up<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.070> workspace

and<00:04:47.760> I've<00:04:47.970> had<00:04:48.180> portioned<00:04:48.750> into<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.199> actually

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
and I've had portioned into it actually

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.010 
and I've had portioned into it actually
turned<00:04:49.740> out<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.010> be<00:04:50.130> five<00:04:50.370> bags<00:04:50.780> these<00:04:51.780> are<00:04:51.900> the

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
turned out to be five bags these are the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870 
turned out to be five bags these are the
quart<00:04:52.500> sized<00:04:52.680> bags<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.190> I'm<00:04:53.310> talking<00:04:53.669> about

so everyone can see it and I left one of

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.210 
so everyone can see it and I left one of
them<00:04:56.780> undone<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.320> have<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.650> portion<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.160> the
