00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.540
 buy the house 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.520
 good yes 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.680
 what can i help you with i could i would 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.980
 like a house wheels from daughter 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.540
 ok what moved drinks well let's go 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.220
 keep it simple i think of ham 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.260
 steve ok team choice you already have stuff 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.780
 yes i have my ground cover and one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.100
 cage with an elegance not even yet 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 and yes you can do when you have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.930
 therefore also needed 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 eat and drink bowls and some toys 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.739
 always nice for yourself not toys 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.199
 and then such a relationship because we do that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.199
 or on page is good idea if you 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.080
 different types of food here 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:08.370
 suspects yes so a lot of variety 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 farmers themselves here we found this feed it 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.360
 very suitable supply here also so who 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 so smart to start because the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 hamster is used to this food 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.360
 ok so I would start with this and then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.760
 say if you have been using the bucket a little longer 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.030
 have you then a return and 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.440
 the same amount of pain to you beforehand 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.240
 once somewhere john cell there are enough 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.900
 vitamins that need everything about our team 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 is good yes so this is different 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.960
 flavors 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.700
 yes this is a pink bottle in urban op 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
 what else in between he may have a few 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 yes nice out 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 yes I understand that is these studies 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 arms later 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.290
 yes but which one can you recommend yes they 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.340
 actually like everything 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.610
 well something like this president 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.200
 runs with the yes and hide 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 things they can gnaw at 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.119
 of course is always important 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.390
 hearts and yes yes here 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.360
 it's like taking a bottle like that 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.459
 of course just fill it and then as soon as 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.440
 that you hear a bit empty again 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 we fill and which different sizes 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.180
 notice yes we have a bigger one here 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.870
