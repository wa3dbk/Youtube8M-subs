00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
why did you have what was the symptom of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
why did you have what was the symptom of
the<00:02:10.200> truck<00:02:10.850> my<00:02:11.850> choke<00:02:12.330> rod<00:02:12.630> was<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.980> was<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.400> was

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
the truck my choke rod was it was it was

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.690 
the truck my choke rod was it was it was
back<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:14.970> off<00:02:15.090> sure<00:02:15.960> kept<00:02:16.470> charity<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.520> it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
back and go off sure kept charity and it

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.120 
back and go off sure kept charity and it
would<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.660> sort<00:02:19.050> head<00:02:19.260> up<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
would so they sort head up so it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.160 
would so they sort head up so it
happened<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> had<00:02:21.150> no<00:02:21.420> resistance<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
happened so it had no resistance of the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
happened so it had no resistance of the
choke<00:02:22.410> rod<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.800> say<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.630> was

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
choke rod you say right so it was

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.280 
choke rod you say right so it was
basically<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.380> floating<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
basically just floating around that you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.960 
basically just floating around that you
couldn't<00:02:31.620> keep<00:02:31.770> your<00:02:32.100> adjustment<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
couldn't keep your adjustment of the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.410 
couldn't keep your adjustment of the
choke<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:34.230> okay

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.540 

so<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.410> bracket<00:02:39.650> right<00:02:39.920> here<00:02:40.190> we're

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
so this is the bracket right here we're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.550 
so this is the bracket right here we're
looking<00:02:40.670> at<00:02:40.970> where<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.420> bushing<00:02:41.990> goes<00:02:42.140> into

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
looking at where that bushing goes into

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.680 
looking at where that bushing goes into
so<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.370> put<00:02:43.550> some<00:02:43.670> brake<00:02:43.880> fluid<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.330> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so you put some brake fluid on that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.080 
so you put some brake fluid on that
little<00:02:45.500> bushing<00:02:45.800> there<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.030> slide<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.720> yep

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
little bushing there so slide in yep

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.530 
little bushing there so slide in yep
okay<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.880> takes<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.240> put<00:02:53.450> it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
okay and that's all it takes to put it

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:08.580 
okay and that's all it takes to put it
in<00:02:53.660> know<00:02:54.080> that<00:03:01.360> feed<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.600> down<00:03:02.840> true<00:03:03.140> okay

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:27.250 

that's<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.680> tight<00:03:09.920> fit<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.320> go<00:03:21.709> along<00:03:26.260> now
