00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.020
 Good day friends with you 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.270
 alexander suite 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.430
 about knives from master sergeant I already 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.170
 was telling 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.059
 a link to the video will be right here to someone 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.700
 interesting to see there is total 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.800
 information and so on here now on 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.380
 I have titanium legs on the table 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.120
 from that same master he is called 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.740
 frame 2 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.330
 why master made such a knife 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 because he didn't have to impose on 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.290
 hilt and decided to make such a frame 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 let's take a quick look at tth 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.399
 already tell you about the knife show pictures and 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 so then what can I say 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.300
 total length 195 millimeters blade length 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.460
 to the extreme point 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.670
 handle start 8 2 and a half 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.629
 millimeter width of the blade at the beginning of descents 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.550
 twenty seven millimeters arm width 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.719
 27 and a half millimeters thickness 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 blade 31 millimeters arm thickness 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.940
 clip weight 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.720
 9 9 millimeters from the clip 14 with 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.230
 half millimeters blade 03 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.670
 steel on the blade h12mf 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.200
 hardening in 60 units if someone does not know 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.070
 what is h12mf 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.460
 This is a kind of analogue of d2 or k110 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.310
 and here and so can sail will notice 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 there are no bearings i don't 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.020
 make no excessive effort to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 In order to open it, I just eat 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:37.270
 very light very comfortable and cool 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 nose poke it we weigh 111 grams gentlemen 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 only 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.670
 so now show photos like him 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.930
 looks disassembled photos 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.150
 ate sergeant 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.420
 but I will add some of my hope 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.420
 it will be interesting 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.480
 Well, as the photos looked saw yes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 as far as she 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.209
 sort of like simple on the other hand not 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.090
 simple we have here even some semblance 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.940
 lock washer is not exactly hinder 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.480
 it is hidden but does not allow us to bend 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:39.230
 frame to where it does not need to turn down 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 such here we have girls can see 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.780
 the wedge is very neat in the center 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.780
 and beautifully executed backspacer 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.170
 well actually 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.549
 wonderful work knife very thin 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:13.290
 let's go compare you can know it 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:14.910
 original sieben sensing meaning 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.500
 I will immediately say that the quality of performance 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:23.720
 Seba is not particularly superior to this so 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.609
 frame goes 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.250
 everything is very clearly verified everything is very 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.639
 well done here some amateur 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.440
 here and does not smell 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.160
 all very, very good look at 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.569
 the clip is quite an original design 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.299
 I liked these spacers here 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.419
 cone-shaped rare truncated cone 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.680
 very cool it's all done here 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:54.930
 that's such a drink 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:00.060
 in order to directly closed and g by 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.790
 the thickness is even larger than that of sebenza 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.379
 speaks about the strength of a knife cut and 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.060
 all other allocation h12mf 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.060
 termichka 60 units 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:25.930
 Awesome Riza part, viz. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.110
 absolutely it turns out great that is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.229
 again bitter rebound steel feels 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.940
 dry on it is applied here such 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:40.180
 sateen is very bad it is very good 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.130
 I really liked the knife that is 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.880
 the overall concept of the whale flipper 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.530
 nudist for me close 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.930
 want to cash in on the backs I am also very 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.210
 I love but meditate like this 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.650
 nose toy 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.430
 it would be very nice to get yourself 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.410
 I hope to order something from the sergeant 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.520
 legs I will refuse excellent performance 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.710
 all the details wonderful geometry by 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.789
 about balance in hand again weight 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.160
 biased to the hilt and its balance is 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:19.990
 about where it starts 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:26.800
 the clip would bite would run you again 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:29.889
 see that is to say it is in the hand very 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.599
 I don't remember anything comfortably anywhere 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.760
 the only thing I would like a little bit 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:39.310
 notch love and notch all the same as for 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.620
 go predator when a custom knife somehow 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.490
 made completely by hand very very 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:52.670
 cool let's see the contours of the blade i 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:57.680
 I think everything will be interesting 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:59.930
 mitrich on everything clearly very well a little 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.470
 not enough for me essays notch this is it 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.690
 such though processed in this way 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.960
 matte such coating on more resistant 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.130
 rather than bead blast lower wear wendy and 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:18.950
 don't see any scuffs here yet 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.570
 This but would like all the same small 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:29.110
 notch here at this place 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:33.050
 these tricks interfered that is reverse grip 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.960
 very comfortable lanyard there is something 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:42.610
 have to dissolve a little paracord all u 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.610
 we get a very healthy knife 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.170
 mophie genes rejoice i need some 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:57.890
 bearings nothing already shake it out 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:59.420
 provisions don't get me a knife not 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.310
 fall out by itself will not open 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.990
 mounted on the pocket is very comfortable it 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.280
 thicker than it was pursued about ours she is not 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:13.550
 the mask is tougher and sits even better too 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:16.250
 titanium and so on torx then new 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.550
 backspacer is generally wonderful 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.580
 turned out sergeant knife hope you had 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:26.230
 Interesting photos I added thanks 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.230
 friends that remains goodbye
