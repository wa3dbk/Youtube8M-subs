00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.210
 hello I see sanz like in this video os 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.210
 I'm going to teach you how to do what you see here 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.620
 very good to do what we need 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.640
 is the cap of a copper bottle a 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.240
 I gave up that we do not use an intensive balloon and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.700
 Instant glue is worth the first 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 what we will have to do is remove the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.950
 power cap and we have to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 hook on top of the disc 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 what I'm going to do as here has a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.489
 little of edges from being cut from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.570
 this plastic I'm going to leave it a little worth 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.190
 so that everything is flatter 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.050
 with a simple sandpaper if it really is not 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.750
 necessary but if you want it to be 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 hook better 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.710
 so you do not have 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.090
 we are with a bit in itself that will give to 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.830
 all good 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.450
 once it's sanding carefully 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.220
 we will apply some of the super glue for 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.199
 this area and then we'll hook it 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.180
 top of the disc be careful 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.470
 because really this queue is very 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.100
 sticky as you can see if they have 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 fingers thrown 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.840
 carefully and very little by little we are going to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.840
 put 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.330
 all over the edge 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.920
 and we will think it right in the center 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.619
 and let it dry we can put 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.460
 if we want a little here for 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460
 reinforce a little more 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.860
 and let's wait for it to dry 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.330
 it's worth once we have it dry 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.310
 now we can see how it holds up well 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.040
 what are we going to do 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.400
 over the stopper but plug that has 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.200
 that is open 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.200
 so you can get clear 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.730
 we have the balloon here and now we are going to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.590
 reinforce so that the balloon really does not 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.510
 get away with adhesive tape from this 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.620
 way we will avoid that really 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.080
 escape 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.020
 let's do it carefully and take it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.340
 both the balloon and 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.340
 the bottle cap 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.680
 we have a couple of laps to ensure 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.680
 and we are going up a bit 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.670
 very well I think it will be enough 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.219
 well the only thing that will be missing is to blow by 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.749
 here fill the balloon and once the balloon 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.519
 it's full we can leave it on the ground 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.060
 and we 'll see how it's floating now 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.060
 let's teach
