00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 before seeing the predictions les 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.089
 I remember that you can comment on your 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 predictions in the comment box 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.290
 the one that is not wrong in any I'm going 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 to give 10 dollars in your paypal account 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 if there is a tie between two people 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 I will give five to each one and if both are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 in agreement we make a tournament to choose 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.930
 the winner if there are more than two winners 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.720
 a tournament will be held to choose two 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 winners remember not to edit it because 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.949
 If I see the word edited, I'm not going to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.170
 take into account when the event starts 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.360
 I will comment on the word closed when 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.969
 see it better no longer comment because no 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.540
 is going to be taken into account now let's go with 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540
 my predictions 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.060
 in team fight that I do not see I never think 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.220
 Axel mania and machoman though is 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.559
 they will take the poor ascension victory 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.030
 it has to rain then I think they are going to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.220
 start the event with the fight in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.710
 couples for the titles that shit 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.390
 come out in the photo Javier kickoff and good 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 in this fight I think that new day is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 will take the victory then I think it's coming 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.540
 the fight between we are versus dolph 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 ziggler here you can not lose ziggler 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 have to win fuck they go to the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.010
 shit if he loses again then comes the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840
 fight between brad versus king bach in this 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.790
 fight I think that bright will take the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 victory then comes the wake of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.250
 rousseff super dinner will finish your job 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 goodbye rousseff luck in your future 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.910
 many speculate that wool is going to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.430
 tell Rousseff that she is American like that 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.830
 changing to face then I think that comes the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 divas fight the sisters candles versus 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.970
 naomi and tamina these last two are 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 they will carry the victory they are super 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.050
 aggressive and can not do the lose 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 then comes the fight between rave to network 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.830
 versus the great new insurance will do 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 a very good fight and vince gives 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.310
 good minutes but in the end I think the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.250
 King Barrett will take victory 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 I hope to be wrong and finally we enter 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.490
 to the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.980
 many say that if he is going to return 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 in this event but that is very difficult 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.270
 it's stupid to put it together now 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.760
 it would be something that nobody expects but 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.860
 I insist it would be stupid the three are 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.380
 very well separately this rivalry 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.180
 to follow up to three upcoming events to 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.190
 I'm not bored at all by rivalry 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 between ambrosi and rollins if they put 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.180
 reigns I'm not going to fuck is what 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.880
 everyone expects a triple threat 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.890
 between these three but well I think that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 seth rogen is going to defend the title and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.300
 poor ambrosio are going to make the bill 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.580
 randy not because it's randy reims not because 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.470
 it's old vince's favorite we're going to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.270
 see what it does what it is that most 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.760
 Interested in the event betray aa 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.160
 rollins and it will cost you the title or of 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.980
 new will help him good now I'm going 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.930
 to say my favorites do not confuse this 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
 with my predictions please my 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.320
 favorites are new day dolph ziggler 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.080

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.600
 naomi vitamin ambrosio set rollins 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.730
 neville which I did not mention is because I 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.830
 no matter what the winners are , everything is 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.810
 fucked for rousseff chau take care and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.860
