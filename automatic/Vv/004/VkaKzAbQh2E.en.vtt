what's to come this season we're very

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.589 
what's to come this season we're very
confident<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:26.970> more<00:00:27.000> confident

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
confident we're a lot more confident

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.120 
confident we're a lot more confident
this<00:00:27.689> year<00:00:27.990> especially<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.590> had<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.859> solid

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this year especially we had a very solid

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
this year especially we had a very solid
season<00:00:29.640> last<00:00:29.939> year<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.359> finished<00:00:30.660> 16th<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
season last year we finished 16th and I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
season last year we finished 16th and I
ranking<00:00:31.980> coming<00:00:32.219> into<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.489> season<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.910> 16th
