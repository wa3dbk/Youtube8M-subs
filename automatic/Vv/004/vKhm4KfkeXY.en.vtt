00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.410
 we went to visit san cristóbal south 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.179
 to know the house of the wind and the one of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.860
 brainstorm two projects 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.019
 self-managed that were built from 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 the hand between the collective architecture 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.820
 expanded and the different communities 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.800
 of the neighborhoods 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.570
 start please telling us where 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 was born expanded architecture from where 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 the idea arose when they started that it was 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.869
 the first thing they did well 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 we started in 2010 because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.080
 we understood that you had to think a little 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 that potential that self-management has 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 from the city cities like bogotá that 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 be self built completely to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 point of strength of the people there is no 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.600
 a collaborative and self-managed work 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.820
 for 25 years we dream of 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.010
 have a communal room but really 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.469
 with this construction a turn was made 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.219
 180 degrees to the community rooms and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.019
 again a cultural house practically 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.049
 it was a long year it was only the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.839
 Sundays with a community pot or the 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.820
 community a long process but for that 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.039
 you will like the people who have collaborated and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.710
 now the children as they are 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.690
 right now and it feels like 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.149
 our where to go to get distracted 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.750
 in people who are drug addicts 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.360
 like to fight words do not come here and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.039
 if it catches your attention is breakdance 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.520
 the only one they want to do and this gives them 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.740
 tranquility we have different 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.110
 activities what is the trial of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 aerobic breakdance we have a day 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.229
 with a foundation that could be for 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.810
 that feeling of well-being or for 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.430
 that the programs that are carried out here are 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 expand to the rest of the community the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.899
 truth I would say we do not need to do 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.330
 many efforts to convince anyone 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.820
 I think these spaces speak for themselves 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.560
 same because it is open because it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.360
 allows access and because there are 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.399
 different possibilities learned 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.810
 quite even I think that we already 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.890
 we are trained to do a work 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.060
 like this one very much welcome to your 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.659
 house with the doors open for 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.659
 when I want to come
