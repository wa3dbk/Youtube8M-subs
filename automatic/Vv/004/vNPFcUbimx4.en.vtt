buff as well as a knife above you will
get<00:02:52.040> more<00:02:52.100> experience<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.300> what<00:02:53.480> I've

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
get more experience now what I've

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.350 
get more experience now what I've
notices<00:02:54.050> guys<00:02:54.260> between<00:02:55.250> each<00:02:55.640> level<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.120> get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
notices guys between each level you get

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.090 
notices guys between each level you get
more<00:02:56.600> experience<00:02:56.870> when<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.200> level<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:57.830> I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
more experience when you level up so I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
more experience when you level up so I
think<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.790> level<00:02:58.970> cap<00:02:59.300> for<00:02:59.690> level<00:03:00.430> four<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.730> a

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
think the level cap for level four is a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.240 
think the level cap for level four is a
I'm<00:03:03.080> not<00:03:03.290> sure<00:03:03.470> don't<00:03:03.709> take<00:03:03.830> my<00:03:03.920> word<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.100> this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I'm not sure don't take my word on this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.390 
I'm not sure don't take my word on this
but<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:04.910> for<00:03:05.510> me<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:06.380> maximum<00:03:07.040> amount<00:03:07.190> of

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
but I think for me the maximum amount of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.449 
but I think for me the maximum amount of
level<00:03:07.760> experience<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.750> could<00:03:08.900> get<00:03:09.050> was<00:03:09.459> 186

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
level experience I could get was 186
