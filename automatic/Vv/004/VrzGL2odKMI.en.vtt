00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.279
 rust is the enemy of all metals with 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.500
 oxygen come in contact 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.910
 sooner or later will be the machines of 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.099
 scope of the ship or for example 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.530
 steel beams but also your balcony grid 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.679
 attacked by the rust but against it you can 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.119
 What to do with epoxy from brooks corrosion 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.310
 controlling agent and primer 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.140
 layer in one because we want to 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.750
 not that this beautiful mg us out of here 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.410
 The first thing we should do is rust 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.359
 remove 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.550
 There are two types of steel 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.660
 brush or flex with one 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.660
 special grinds 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 and to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.089
 we would have all the loose rust 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 so we can remove it now 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.559
 start applying the epoxy and that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.219
 with the spray can or with brush and 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.680
 role 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.350
 you should have a distance of 25 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.979
 centimeters and if possible 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.979
 equal to 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.610
 so you get a gapless 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.259
 she turns black when dry 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.799
 It may be that she does that a few times 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.930
 repeat a shiny black 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.280
 and even layer get that 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 was the spray can but we also have 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 the brush and the scooter 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.030
 Remember to apply when applying 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 several lay a dry season of two 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 hours and if it already 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.380
 shiny dried is like at 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.090
 This mg must be able to stay for 24 hours 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 cure before coming to the next 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 can begin 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.490
 you then have a finished primer 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.319
 layer would be but to control this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.269
 could it rise and the rust could 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.000
 return the primer again 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.220
 You can cover them immediately or 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.739
 if there are dents there first fill and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.329
 then cover 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.940
 but what exactly does this epoxy do ? 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.030
 the liquid forms with the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.950
 neutralized rust layer one 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.329
 organometallic iron compounds the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.430
 black layer that arises 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.540
 helps against rust emergence and is the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.940
 underground for new paint the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.739
 color layer or spatula mass, it is 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.629
 actually rust around converters and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.629
 Priming layer in one 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.970
 momox epoxy is for home improvement and 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 professionals and is available in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.280
 spray cans to 30 100 or 200 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.470
 milliliters in 1 and 5 liter cans and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.530
 the spray cans with 100 and 400 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.640
 milliliters per knox epoxy frost rust 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.640
 protects iron
