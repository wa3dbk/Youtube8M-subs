00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.070
 when I went to take part in the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.710

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 I like about the recognized whistle 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.750
 prestige and values ​​at a 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.750
 international 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.360
 the second important point that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.390
 think about how lucky they are 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.770
 to receive info to receive training the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 world is not passing a few conditions 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.020
 good financially you already know how 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.850
 is and there are few people who want and have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.119
 training 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.400
 they have they want and they are anxious 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.090
 training and that you have to value it 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.590

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.840
 I would also like to share with 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.430

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.439
 almost every 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.510
 we are born we live and we maintain a zone of 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.670
 comfort 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.470

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.940
 He has been told maybe a husband 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.940

 comfort we would like you 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.409
 this was not so 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
 that came out of those bubbles in the 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.939
 comfort of comfort that if someone 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.510
 it costs something to be sacrificed what 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.340
 do with affection 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 grow a boss told me an Asian boss 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.099
 a few years ago you only believe 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.560
 professionally and personally coming out of 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.769
 this comfort zone to something do not have 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.769
 fear 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.269
 values ​​are deep convictions 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.879
 of the human beings that determine their 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.909
 way of being and guide their behavior 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.180
 here not only to receive training 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.849
 professional that is 80 percent but 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.190
 that you remember very well that that departure from 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.010
 comfort zone will identify your 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.870
 life the rest of the days the values ​​will 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.050
 they involve our feelings and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 emotions 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.920
 at the end it's not just a training 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.540
 but it is going to relate more things 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.120
 the most important values of the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.220
 person is part of your identity 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.890
 they will have their own identity and that 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.430
 professional entity we want that dv 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.810

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.670
 the integrity 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.740
 an old proverb this occurred to me 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.140
 this morning but I thought it was appropriate 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.540
 share it an old Chinese proverb 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.410
 says when the wise man points to the moon 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.270
 the fool looks at the finger 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.270
 I do not know I kept looking at the old 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.819
 use on the moon we will identify that as 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.769

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.250
 we really want to be recognized 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.670
