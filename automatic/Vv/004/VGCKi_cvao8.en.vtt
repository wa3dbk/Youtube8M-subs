time and whatever happened happened and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
time and whatever happened happened and
then<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> came<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> conclusion<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
then I came to the conclusion that it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
or build a new squad or whatever and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
or build a new squad or whatever and
then<00:00:40.890> go<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.160> play<00:00:41.219> again<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.000> that's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
then go and play again and so that's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
then go and play again and so that's
what<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:44.040> I
