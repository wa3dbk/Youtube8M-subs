00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.250
 so 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.490
 now how about how to stay from payroll to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.620
 this new video in this video what 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.050
 let's see is very important very 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.789
 useful and very easy to do for when 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.410
 we want to modify certain 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.960
 parts of our operating system 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.670
 when we want to install a program 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.470
 important that will affect our 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.510
 system then many times what 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.130
 happen with these some programs or 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.320
 some things that we try is 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.660
 that fail or are not but in this system 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.660
 operative and tend to make our 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.190
 operating system fail and we 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.440
 we could get to lose things 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.059
 important things that would serve us or 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.559
 we can lose our 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.380
 configuration because we do not want to lose 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.450
 side because we do not want to end up 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.940
 affect our operating system to 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.280
 that we do a restoration in 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.290
 this point of restoration is a point 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.790
 where we can say that our 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 computer works fine then 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.600
 us at the moment that our 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.640
 computer fail what we do is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.070
 go back to that restoration point and it's going 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.540
 back to where where we 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.820
 we had saved that is us 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.870
 let's make a point of restoration and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.160
 that point 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.530
 will save all the configurations 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.190
 that are working well in that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.090
 moment yes and then when yes 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.500
 I will fail 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.450
 or have a problem with your 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.580
 computer you will be able to go back to that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 been where your pc was fine where 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.940
 the operating system was fine 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.800
 then what we are going to do 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.860
 this time in creating that point of 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.660
 restoration and good let's see how it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.970
 create is very easy so we're going to 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.310
 start what they are going to do problems 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.410
 here at the desk we are going to go to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.360
 this menu that appears here in this 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.520
 part simply with tracking the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.980
 magicians we can already have this let's 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.700
 do here there are configuration let's go 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.920
 to where it says pc information 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.250
 or if we can not also go from the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 folder from egypt we are going to give that the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.110
 right on equipment properties and also 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.219
 the same will come out saying the same 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.450
 process let's come up where it says 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.209
 advanced system configuration 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.220
 this is what we are going to do 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.160
 we are going to where it says protection 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.400
 the system once we are here and 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.959
 let's also click here on create 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.519
 let's put a name to this point 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.069
 of restoration for example we can 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.110
 put the date hey are sealed with your 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.849
 phase of 2014 or can you name it 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.130
 you want and are going to click on 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.510
 create is going to create the point of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.920
 restoration this may take a few 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.620
 seconds because you can that is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.420
 keeping everything everything then what is 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.080
 important to the system then that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.730
 is saving let's wait min here 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.650
 has already been created tells me that the point of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.870
 Progress was created correctly 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.750
 let's say with closing and it's going to be 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.739
 created our restoration points 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.180
 us how do we to be able to 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.130
 restore at some point our 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.140
 system by some fault so it was 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.049
 many times there are people who tell me 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.810
 that appears a black pants with 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.140
 some applications then it is very 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.480
 easy you just have to access from 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 and the configurations that would be from 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.920
 my safe mode then what are you going to 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.540
 do it 's time to start your pc 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.980
 suppose that the screen fell 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.170
 black then what he's going to do is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.170
 restart I think you're going to squeeze 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 efe 6 I think it's to be able 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.640
 get all the settings me 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.080
 forget what the screen is called but it is 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 a screen that I will be here 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.840
 putting where you can access 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.310
 some options in the system 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.440
 operative where you are going to be able 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.600
 restore your operating system and what 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.820
 they are going to do just go to options 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400
 advanced will go to restore system 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.590
 les screen will reappear 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.150
 to restore system you are going to 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.850
 choose the point of restoration that in 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.370
 this case is the one that worked well and 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.620
 obviously they are going to click on exit and go 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 to accept all the conditions and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.340
 You know this is very important if you 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.080
 you have some files and things that you have 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.510
 done after you will not lose 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.930
 unfortunately or you will lose programs 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.190
 that you have installed and after it started 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.570
 this failure obviously all those that 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.370
 install from this point on 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.560
 restoration is going to affect is going to see 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.200
 affected then 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.690
 tell all those things I always tell you 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.910
 I'm going to install a new program or something 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.180
 that changes the appearance of my system 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.070
 operative I do it just in case or there 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110
 some programs that are already 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.050
 restoration as your look as some 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.000
 others with celina I think it does more 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.730
 at the point of restoration because they 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.470
 these programs like they know they're going to 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.540
 know that they will affect many parts 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.440
 of the system then that's why what 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.660
 they create and it's very very important that 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.990
 you can restore your system in 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.250
 certain cases and it's also very useful as well 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.310
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.630
 this video have understood everything because 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.880
 is important after this point of 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.610
 restoration this also serves to 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.240
 windows look also work very 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.970
 all right 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.800
 and it's very very important so many 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.139
 thank you for watching this video and 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.100
 see you in the next video that 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.100
 have an excellent day
