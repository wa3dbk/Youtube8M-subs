just<00:02:25.870> doing<00:02:26.020> some<00:02:26.260> basting<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.980> don't<00:02:27.310> know

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
some what's it called I think this is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.350 
some what's it called I think this is
basting<00:02:29.560> what<00:02:30.250> was<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.520> wasn't<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.120> supposed

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
basting what was it wasn't it supposed

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390 
basting what was it wasn't it supposed
to<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.480> called<00:02:31.630> braising<00:02:32.050> oh<00:02:32.290> wait<00:02:33.250> are<00:02:33.370> we

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to be called braising oh wait are we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.740 
to be called braising oh wait are we
doing<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> wrong<00:02:33.820> thing<00:02:34.120> what's<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
doing the wrong thing what's the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.600 
doing the wrong thing what's the
difference<00:02:35.020> between<00:02:35.100> basting<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.220> braising

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
difference between basting and braising

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.650 
difference between basting and braising
I<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:37.060> no<00:02:37.270> idea

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
I have no idea

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.690 
I have no idea
Oh<00:02:37.870> are<00:02:38.350> we<00:02:38.500> not<00:02:38.620> doing<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.490> don't

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
Oh are we not doing this right I don't

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.790 
Oh are we not doing this right I don't
know<00:02:39.930> I'll<00:02:40.930> look<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.410> Internet

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
know I'll look it up on the Internet

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.370 
know I'll look it up on the Internet
yeah<00:02:41.980> all<00:02:42.880> right<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.390> think<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.900> braising

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
yeah all right so I think that braising

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.660 
yeah all right so I think that braising
means<00:02:44.560> we're<00:02:44.770> supposed<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> put<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> oven

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
means we're supposed to put in the oven

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.580 
means we're supposed to put in the oven
but<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.030> could<00:02:46.180> also<00:02:46.390> do<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.959> way<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.350> per

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
but we could also do it this way as per

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.850 
but we could also do it this way as per
the<00:02:47.709> instructions<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:50.530> what<00:02:50.680> we're

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the instructions and I think what we're

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.090 
the instructions and I think what we're
doing<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:51.340> simmering<00:02:52.060> maybe<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.890> like

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
doing is like simmering maybe with like

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.770 
doing is like simmering maybe with like
a<00:02:54.130> little<00:02:54.340> bit<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.550> basting<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.450> finishing

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the steak is okay I don't know why not

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.789 
the steak is okay I don't know why not
sure<00:03:25.600> why<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.019> thought<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.440> wouldn't<00:03:26.650> happen

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
sure why I thought that wouldn't happen

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.620 
sure why I thought that wouldn't happen
so<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.340> steak<00:03:27.610> I'm<00:03:27.850> gonna<00:03:28.000> I'm<00:03:28.269> at<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.390> safe

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
so the steak I'm gonna I'm at a safe

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.690 
so the steak I'm gonna I'm at a safe
distance<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.560> there's<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.890> steak<00:03:30.160> it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700

cuts<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.940> meat<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.930> longer<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.860> cook<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.280> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
cuts of meat the longer you cook it the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.979 
cuts of meat the longer you cook it the
better<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.820> tastes<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:04.360> like<00:04:04.660> if<00:04:04.750> it's<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
better it tastes because like if it's a

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.220 
better it tastes because like if it's a
if<00:04:05.230> it's<00:04:05.320> not<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> super<00:04:06.310> great<00:04:06.489> quality<00:04:06.970> meat

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
if it's not a super great quality meat

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.440 
if it's not a super great quality meat
cooking<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.320> for<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.500> longer<00:04:08.709> time<00:04:08.950> will<00:04:09.489> make

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
cooking it for a longer time will make

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.600 
cooking it for a longer time will make
it<00:04:10.570> more<00:04:10.660> tender<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.290> think<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.010> maybe<00:04:12.340> that's

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
it more tender I think so maybe that's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.890 
it more tender I think so maybe that's
what<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.209> might<00:04:13.390> just<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.780> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
what this is this might just be like a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.140 
what this is this might just be like a
not-so-great<00:04:14.440> quality<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.370> cut<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.970> meat

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
not-so-great quality like cut of meat

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.210 
not-so-great quality like cut of meat
and<00:04:16.389> that's<00:04:17.320> why<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.590> have<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.769> cook<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:17.980> for<00:04:18.100> an

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
and that's why we have to cook it for an

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.280 
and that's why we have to cook it for an
hour<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:19.120> feel<00:04:19.269> like<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:19.570> feels

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
hour I just feel like it feels

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.770 
hour I just feel like it feels
like<00:04:20.620> really<00:04:20.860> dense<00:04:21.550> whenever<00:04:22.330> I'm<00:04:22.540> like

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
like really dense whenever I'm like

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.900 
like really dense whenever I'm like
turning<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.710> over<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.040> stuff<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.700> I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
turning it over and stuff so I just I

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.510 
turning it over and stuff so I just I
don't<00:04:25.330> know<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.660> don't<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.740> it'll<00:04:27.310> be<00:04:27.430> an

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
don't know I don't know it'll be an

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.310 
don't know I don't know it'll be an
experiment<00:04:27.910> we'll<00:04:28.240> have<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:29.080> has<00:04:29.170> like

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
experiment we'll have to see it has like

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.920 
experiment we'll have to see it has like
10<00:04:29.590> more<00:04:29.710> minutes<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.160> cook<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.690> we'll<00:04:31.690> see

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
10 more minutes to cook so we'll see

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.890 
10 more minutes to cook so we'll see
what<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.680> looks<00:04:32.890> like<00:04:33.040> together<00:04:33.780> already

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
what it looks like together already

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.690 
what it looks like together already
Tim<00:04:35.110> isn't<00:04:35.290> home<00:04:35.560> yet<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.040> steaks<00:04:36.340> are

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
Tim isn't home yet but the steaks are

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.780 
Tim isn't home yet but the steaks are
done<00:04:36.730> I<00:04:37.450> think<00:04:38.140> they<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.650> according<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.610> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
done I think they are according to the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.300 
done I think they are according to the
time<00:04:40.030> they're<00:04:40.420> done<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.710> guess<00:04:41.950> we'll<00:04:42.190> let

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
time they're done so I guess we'll let

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.980 
time they're done so I guess we'll let
him<00:04:42.400> rest<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.940> little<00:04:43.000> bit<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.540> then<00:04:43.690> see

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
him rest for a little bit and then see

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.930 
him rest for a little bit and then see
what<00:04:44.140> they<00:04:44.230> look<00:04:44.380> like<00:04:44.410> inside<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.490> there's

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
what they look like inside and there's

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.880 
what they look like inside and there's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
mine so I wanted to show you what it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.820 
mine so I wanted to show you what it
looks<00:04:58.450> like<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.170> very<00:04:59.410> very<00:04:59.500> very

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
looks like and it is very very very

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.890 
looks like and it is very very very
overcooked<00:05:00.790> but<00:05:01.150> this<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.420> how<00:05:01.540> long<00:05:01.690> they

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
overcooked but this is how long they

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.940 
overcooked but this is how long they
said<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.200> cook<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.770> was<00:05:02.890> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
said to cook it and it was the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.200 
said to cook it and it was the
temperature<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.340> they<00:05:03.580> said<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.850> cook<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.090> at

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
temperature that they said to cook it at

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.010 
temperature that they said to cook it at
so<00:05:05.170> I<00:05:05.730> guess<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.820> Montreal<00:05:07.210> steak<00:05:07.390> just<00:05:07.810> maybe

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
so I guess the Montreal steak just maybe

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.810 
so I guess the Montreal steak just maybe
isn't<00:05:08.410> for<00:05:08.530> me<00:05:08.620> but<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:09.010> was<00:05:09.040> on<00:05:09.220> sale<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.700> I'm
