a green monster airplane the front kind
of<00:05:41.269> looks<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.509> bit<00:05:41.539> distorted<00:05:42.309> that's<00:05:43.309> okay

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
of looks a bit distorted that's okay

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.969 
of looks a bit distorted that's okay
who<00:05:44.449> cares<00:05:50.529> big<00:05:51.529> though

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
who cares big though

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:59.589 
who cares big though
I<00:05:55.539> was<00:05:56.539> a<00:05:56.569> pig<00:05:57.939> the<00:05:58.939> hell<00:05:59.089> is<00:05:59.179> that<00:05:59.239> doing<00:05:59.509> there

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
I was a pig the hell is that doing there

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.819 
I was a pig the hell is that doing there
oh<00:06:01.119> yeah<00:06:02.119> I<00:06:02.149> removed<00:06:02.659> all<00:06:02.899> the<00:06:02.959> mobs<00:06:03.289> but<00:06:03.649> they

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:03.829 
oh yeah I removed all the mobs but they

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:05.139 
oh yeah I removed all the mobs but they
still<00:06:04.159> the<00:06:04.459> crafts<00:06:04.759> didn't<00:06:04.969> grow<00:06:05.119> back

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:05.149 
still the crafts didn't grow back

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:07.539 
still the crafts didn't grow back
completely<00:06:05.860> because<00:06:06.860> when<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.099> download<00:06:07.459> this

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:07.549 
completely because when I download this

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:09.100 
completely because when I download this
map<00:06:07.729> is<00:06:07.969> always<00:06:08.119> a<00:06:08.209> bunch<00:06:08.449> of<00:06:08.539> mobs<00:06:08.779> but<00:06:09.079> I

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
map is always a bunch of mobs but I

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.949 
map is always a bunch of mobs but I
figured<00:06:09.409> out<00:06:09.529> how<00:06:09.619> to<00:06:09.649> get<00:06:09.919> rid<00:06:10.069> of<00:06:10.129> them<00:06:10.959> and

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:11.959 
figured out how to get rid of them and

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.059 
figured out how to get rid of them and
then<00:06:12.049> we<00:06:12.139> see<00:06:12.289> this<00:06:12.529> a<00:06:13.059> runway<00:06:14.059> in<00:06:14.739> this<00:06:15.739> runway

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
then we see this a runway in this runway

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.209 
then we see this a runway in this runway
took<00:06:16.369> a<00:06:16.399> long<00:06:16.669> time<00:06:16.699> to<00:06:16.939> build<00:06:17.709> because<00:06:18.709> it's

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
took a long time to build because it's

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.289 
took a long time to build because it's
18<00:06:19.759> across<00:06:20.469> and<00:06:21.469> it<00:06:21.679> goes<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:22.729> whole<00:06:22.939> full

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:23.299 
18 across and it goes the whole full

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.289 
18 across and it goes the whole full
length<00:06:23.569> of<00:06:23.779> this<00:06:23.899> map<00:06:24.699> which<00:06:25.699> is<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.999> normal

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:26.299 
length of this map which is the normal

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:29.139 
length of this map which is the normal
length<00:06:26.449> of<00:06:26.629> any<00:06:26.779> minute<00:06:27.139> things<00:06:28.039> like<00:06:28.159> 155

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.149 
length of any minute things like 155

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:33.939 
length of any minute things like 155
blocks<00:06:29.509> maybe<00:06:29.889> so<00:06:30.889> what<00:06:31.069> are<00:06:31.159> 18<00:06:31.699> times<00:06:32.379> 51<00:06:33.379> 55

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
blocks maybe so what are 18 times 51 55

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.689 
blocks maybe so what are 18 times 51 55
is<00:06:34.159> I<00:06:34.279> think<00:06:34.399> is<00:06:34.489> like<00:06:34.579> a<00:06:34.849> little<00:06:35.479> less<00:06:35.659> than

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
is I think is like a little less than

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.299 
is I think is like a little less than
2,800<00:06:37.699> low<00:06:37.909> less<00:06:38.059> than<00:06:38.209> 20<00:06:38.419> hundred<00:06:38.779> I<00:06:38.809> think

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:39.309 
2,800 low less than 20 hundred I think

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.249 
2,800 low less than 20 hundred I think
and<00:06:40.309> so<00:06:40.610> yeah<00:06:40.849> as<00:06:41.119> you<00:06:41.329> can<00:06:41.479> imagine<00:06:41.569> that<00:06:42.050> also

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
and so yeah as you can imagine that also

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.739 
and so yeah as you can imagine that also
takes<00:06:42.559> a<00:06:42.679> really<00:06:42.800> long<00:06:42.919> time<00:06:43.539> if<00:06:44.539> you<00:06:44.629> guys

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:44.749 
takes a really long time if you guys

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:46.089 
takes a really long time if you guys
want<00:06:44.989> me<00:06:45.050> to<00:06:45.079> make<00:06:45.169> a<00:06:45.319> tutorial<00:06:45.469> on<00:06:45.919> how<00:06:46.069> to
