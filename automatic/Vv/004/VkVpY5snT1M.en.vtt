00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.860
 no 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.830
 the last great guest of this event 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.200
 it was baba ideas that we could 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.810
 interview the creator one of the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.040
 creators of the use of series 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 certainly one of the most important 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.450
 Japanese developers in circulation 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.980
 that with tense symphony chronicles and returns 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.680
 in homes with one edition 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.509
 remastered in hd of the united of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.940
 best of the series we are 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.200
 the title looks well done you make one 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.090
 of the best titles in the top series 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.399
 we are happy to see it in 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.140
 general was also confirmed 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.910
 the arrival of cesium two daughter then 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.050
 let's say the saga fans have 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.390
 much to be happy about 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.490
 It's always very complicated game 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.840
 extremely well structured loves 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 superfine combat that already 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.860
 at the time it was superfine that translates 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.829
 paradoxically very good even today 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 graphically we are still low levels 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.890
 nima is tense they never aimed at 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.750
 graphic is therefore not exactly the most 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.190
 serious problems and let's see what has 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.479
 replied to the obama during the session 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.899
 of questions and answers because I could not 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.899
 do with him 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.300
 recently many papers have sprung up 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 in Italy but symphonia is remembered 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.140
 by many lovers of the series like 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 one of the best racks keeps 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.530
 all the typical features of the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 linear motion battle system is a system 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 very complex combat system 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.510
 of forced development return from 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.490
 comparable gems as well as a story 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.480
 very well structured it was appreciated 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.370
 very much Japan at the moment 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.270
 of the output and generally received 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.200
 very well also by critics 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.630
 international 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.680
 this third symphonia chronicles seems 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.090
 not wanting to change some 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.770
 main game features a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 part of the graphic clearly upscalata 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.950
 his current consoles 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.479
 best feature 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.979
 in addition to being the first a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.350
 bring a collector edition to Italy 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.270
 of all respect of the tales of and the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 fact of containing gift of the world the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 second treasure symphonia a sequel 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 direct appeared on wii that not many 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.070
 players have got to try 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 not 9 new world not fire as well 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 well one is still a very good one 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 jrpg contains a fair number of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.070
 innovation compared to the predecessor between 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.479
 where the combat system and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.580
 slightly altered and the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.020
 ability to capture monsters later 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 having observed game we could do 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.530
 a chat with the Obama men 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.450
 he proved very kind and with whom 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.620
 we talked about food for some 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.420
 minute before starting the interview 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.890
 as soon as she returned to the translator 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.880
 official we could do some 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.730
 This is what he answered 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.830
 he expected the success of the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 thesis series in europe you have chosen to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.769
 finally bring one around here 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.370
 collector edition because it turned out 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.170
 exceeding expectations 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.819
 here is one of the main reasons for 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.890
 which we brought the titles of the series 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.750
 europa is the will to enlarge the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.640
 user base and over the years are 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.409
 was very happy to be able to present 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.750
 the series in various media tours and to have 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.190
 had success in various European countries 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 to the point of bringing a collector 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 edition also European fans 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.329
 we should expect changes to the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.489
 books to the game structure in this 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.510
 case it pollutes chronicles or yes 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.610
 it 's a simple update 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.110
 graphic 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 our basic goal for the hills 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.859
 of symphonia chronicles and report 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.049
 in houses intense or synphonia in one 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.120
 improves graphics and renews it 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.190
 therefore thanks to playstation 3 we have 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 improved technical blame we send 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.760
 legis to keep storyline e 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.829
 game mechanics unchanged respect 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.299
 to the original titles since they have been 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.190
 much appreciated by fouls in the past the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.170
 the second weak point of the series 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.640
 many resides in the technical sector you have 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.989
 intend to revolutionize things with 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.840
 a new engine with the arrival of the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.120
 console next gen we have no plans for 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.739
 ps4 titles xbox man of the series 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.959
 hills at the moment while as far as 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.209
 it's about many jrpg graphics now 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.980
 they aim at photorealism lately but 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.109
 the tales series has always had one 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.269
 very special graphics because we 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.000
 we combine manga and color anime style 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.500
 similar to painting we think it is 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.959
 very important to keep ours 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 uniqueness and scale of the world therefore the 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.680
 future we will always focus on uniqueness 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.680
 of style rather than graphics 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.530
 what helgo lass what is your title 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.530
 favorite of the whole saga 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.519
 you only have on me is a question that me 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.019
 a lot of people always do 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.510
 but it is really difficult to choose one 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.860
 series game my favorite though 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.500
 he was obliged to make a choice 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.480
 would have thought the first title fanciful 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.280
 of the saga because it already contains i 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.830
 fundamentals of the rest of the 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.990
 series as linear motion battle system e 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.190
 the typical approach is the storyline 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.870
 I therefore consider it a very title 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.040
 innovative for the period in which it is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.040
 came out could charge peace
