00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.000 

you<00:00:07.720> don't<00:00:07.960> have<00:00:08.140> to<00:00:08.260> eat<00:00:08.380> a<00:00:08.410> ton<00:00:08.650> of<00:00:08.680> food<00:00:08.860> to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
you don't have to eat a ton of food to

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.860 
you don't have to eat a ton of food to
become<00:00:09.250> well<00:00:09.430> nourished<00:00:09.790> in<00:00:10.150> fact<00:00:10.480> it's<00:00:10.780> about

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
become well nourished in fact it's about

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.650 
become well nourished in fact it's about
nutrient<00:00:11.380> density<00:00:11.740> that<00:00:11.950> matters<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:13.389> what<00:00:13.570> is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
nutrient density that matters so what is

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.360 
nutrient density that matters so what is
nutrient<00:00:14.200> density<00:00:14.440> well<00:00:14.740> it's<00:00:15.040> actually

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
nutrient density well it's actually

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.850 
nutrient density well it's actually
ratio<00:00:16.059> where<00:00:16.510> you<00:00:16.630> compare<00:00:17.110> the<00:00:17.470> amount<00:00:17.710> of

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
ratio where you compare the amount of

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.179 
ratio where you compare the amount of
calories<00:00:18.220> in<00:00:18.820> a<00:00:18.880> given<00:00:19.630> food<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:20.189> its

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
calories in a given food to its

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.710 
calories in a given food to its
nutritional<00:00:21.700> value<00:00:21.759> so<00:00:22.180> it's<00:00:22.300> vitamins

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
nutritional value so it's vitamins

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.780 
nutritional value so it's vitamins
minerals<00:00:23.110> phytochemicals<00:00:23.320> antioxidants<00:00:24.009> so

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
minerals phytochemicals antioxidants so

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.069 
minerals phytochemicals antioxidants so
of<00:00:24.849> course<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.180> goal<00:00:25.329> is<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.509> try<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:25.840> get<00:00:25.960> as

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
of course the goal is to try and get as

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.040 
of course the goal is to try and get as
much<00:00:26.739> of<00:00:26.800> each<00:00:27.130> nutrient<00:00:27.759> while<00:00:28.149> taking<00:00:28.899> in<00:00:28.960> as

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
much of each nutrient while taking in as

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.290 
much of each nutrient while taking in as
few<00:00:29.290> calories<00:00:29.560> as<00:00:29.890> possible<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.820> an<00:00:30.910> example

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
few calories as possible so an example

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.420 
few calories as possible so an example
would<00:00:31.360> be<00:00:31.419> kale<00:00:31.689> kale<00:00:32.439> scores<00:00:32.829> a<00:00:32.890> thousand

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
would be kale kale scores a thousand

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.620 
would be kale kale scores a thousand
which<00:00:33.520> is<00:00:33.550> right<00:00:33.850> at<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.059> top<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.390> chart

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
which is right at the top of the chart

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.880 
which is right at the top of the chart
because<00:00:34.840> it's<00:00:34.930> very<00:00:35.079> high<00:00:35.290> in<00:00:35.350> nutrients

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
because it's very high in nutrients

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.200 
because it's very high in nutrients
relative<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.550> amount<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.760> calories<00:00:36.940> at

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
relative to the amount of calories at

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.330 
relative to the amount of calories at
house<00:00:37.360> whereas<00:00:37.960> soda<00:00:38.230> for<00:00:38.440> example<00:00:38.920> gets<00:00:39.250> a

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
house whereas soda for example gets a

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.709 
house whereas soda for example gets a
one<00:00:39.579> it's<00:00:39.789> right<00:00:39.910> at<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> bottom<00:00:40.510> because

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
one it's right at the bottom because

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.810 
one it's right at the bottom because
very<00:00:40.989> high<00:00:41.109> in<00:00:41.230> calories<00:00:41.379> yet<00:00:42.160> has<00:00:42.340> very<00:00:42.550> few

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
very high in calories yet has very few

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.139 
very high in calories yet has very few
nutrients<00:00:43.329> so<00:00:44.140> if<00:00:45.039> we<00:00:45.309> can<00:00:45.489> base<00:00:45.699> our<00:00:45.850> diet<00:00:46.030> on

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
nutrients so if we can base our diet on

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.639 
nutrients so if we can base our diet on
those<00:00:46.269> nutrient-dense<00:00:46.719> Whole<00:00:47.019> Foods<00:00:47.050> we're

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
those nutrient-dense Whole Foods we're

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.079 
those nutrient-dense Whole Foods we're
obviously<00:00:47.920> gonna<00:00:48.160> get<00:00:48.339> more<00:00:48.519> nutrition<00:00:48.820> and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
obviously gonna get more nutrition and

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.160 
obviously gonna get more nutrition and
it's<00:00:49.179> not<00:00:49.269> about<00:00:49.420> volume<00:00:49.809> you<00:00:49.870> don't<00:00:49.989> have<00:00:50.079> to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
it's not about volume you don't have to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.779 
it's not about volume you don't have to
eat<00:00:50.230> more<00:00:50.530> food<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.160> just<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.670> get

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
eat more food you just have to get

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.000 
eat more food you just have to get
better<00:00:51.999> quality<00:00:52.359> food<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.010> alkaline-forming

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
better quality food and alkaline-forming

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.040 
better quality food and alkaline-forming
to<00:00:54.519> foods<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:55.059> are<00:00:55.269> nutrient<00:00:55.749> dense<00:00:55.780> are

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
to foods that are nutrient dense are

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.930 
to foods that are nutrient dense are
inherently<00:00:56.499> more<00:00:56.649> alkaline<00:00:57.129> forming<00:00:57.399> because

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
inherently more alkaline forming because

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.509 
inherently more alkaline forming because
minerals<00:00:58.510> are<00:00:58.809> extremely<00:00:59.739> outline<00:01:00.100> forming

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
minerals are extremely outline forming

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.520 
minerals are extremely outline forming
and<00:01:00.670> minerals<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.539> course<00:01:01.749> are<00:01:01.899> nutrients<00:01:02.320> so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and minerals of course are nutrients so

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.840 
and minerals of course are nutrients so
they<00:01:02.739> go<00:01:03.190> hand-in-hand

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
they go hand-in-hand

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.060 
they go hand-in-hand
also<00:01:04.570> brightly<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.379> intensely<00:01:05.800> colored

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
also brightly and intensely colored

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.180 
also brightly and intensely colored
fruits<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.610> vegetables<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:07.210> high<00:01:07.750> in

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
fruits of vegetables are high in

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.740 
fruits of vegetables are high in
antioxidants<00:01:09.190> which<00:01:09.790> are<00:01:09.940> also<00:01:10.060> nutrients<00:01:10.630> so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
antioxidants which are also nutrients so

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.870 
antioxidants which are also nutrients so
when<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:10.990> pick<00:01:11.229> those<00:01:11.590> bright<00:01:11.860> oranges<00:01:12.490> reds

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
when you pick those bright oranges reds

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.069 
when you pick those bright oranges reds
greens<00:01:13.710> Purple's<00:01:14.710> blues<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:16.540> going<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.780> be

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
greens Purple's blues you're going to be

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.289 
greens Purple's blues you're going to be
assured<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.649> getting<00:01:17.770> more<00:01:18.070> nutrition<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.850> a

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
assured of getting more nutrition in a

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.270 
assured of getting more nutrition in a
smaller<00:01:19.720> volume<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.320> food<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.740> that's<00:01:21.009> a<00:01:21.130> good

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
smaller volume of food and that's a good

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.270 
smaller volume of food and that's a good
thing<00:01:21.899> high<00:01:22.899> netgain<00:01:23.170> nutrition<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.009> one<00:01:24.040> of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
thing high netgain nutrition is one of

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.830 
thing high netgain nutrition is one of
the<00:01:24.340> most<00:01:24.520> important<00:01:25.090> elements<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.570> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
the most important elements of the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.749 
the most important elements of the
Thrive<00:01:26.110> diet<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:26.920> basically<00:01:27.219> about<00:01:27.399> getting

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
Thrive diet it's basically about getting

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.090 
Thrive diet it's basically about getting
more<00:01:27.969> for<00:01:28.360> less<00:01:28.540> spend<00:01:29.290> less<00:01:29.530> digestive

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
more for less spend less digestive

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.219 
more for less spend less digestive
energy<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.610> get<00:01:30.700> more<00:01:31.000> nutrition<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.200> a

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
energy to get more nutrition so a

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.840 
energy to get more nutrition so a
calorie<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.799> a<00:01:32.860> measure<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.100> food<00:01:33.280> energy<00:01:33.610> so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
calorie is a measure of food energy so

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.029 
calorie is a measure of food energy so
for<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.119> long<00:01:34.210> time<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.479> used<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:35.110> think<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.920> more

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
for a long time I used to think the more

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.190 
for a long time I used to think the more
calories<00:01:36.280> ate<00:01:36.670> more<00:01:37.030> energy<00:01:37.360> out<00:01:37.390> half<00:01:37.689> not

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
calories ate more energy out half not

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.990 
calories ate more energy out half not
the<00:01:38.350> case<00:01:38.500> because<00:01:38.829> if<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.280> spend<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.759> lot<00:01:39.880> of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
the case because if to spend a lot of

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.359 
the case because if to spend a lot of
energy<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.899> digest<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.350> assimilate<00:01:41.439> highly

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
energy to digest and assimilate highly

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.249 
energy to digest and assimilate highly
processed<00:01:42.579> food<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.420> energies<00:01:44.200> like

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
processed food and energies like
