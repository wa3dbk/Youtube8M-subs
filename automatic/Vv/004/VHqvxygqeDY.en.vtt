00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
will be a big setback in the push for

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.870 
will be a big setback in the push for
top<00:04:11.329> four<00:04:11.660> at<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.440> moment<00:04:12.799> United<00:04:13.430> are<00:04:13.549> five

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880

points<00:04:14.239> clear<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.480> Liverpool<00:04:14.959> but<00:04:15.470> if<00:04:15.620> we

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
points clear of Liverpool but if we

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.069 
points clear of Liverpool but if we
manage<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.370> beat<00:04:16.639> Swansea<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.449> that<00:04:17.870> beat

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
manage to beat Swansea and that beat

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.409 
manage to beat Swansea and that beat
United<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:18.829> we<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.280> actually<00:04:19.430> go<00:04:19.970> above

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
United that we can actually go above

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.160 
United that we can actually go above
them<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:20.870> the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
them in the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.490 
them in the
but<00:04:21.530> that's<00:04:21.710> a<00:04:21.830> big<00:04:21.980> if<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.520> think<00:04:23.210> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
but that's a big if I think the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.600 
but that's a big if I think the
Liverpool<00:04:24.500> man<00:04:24.620> united<00:04:25.040> game<00:04:25.250> will<00:04:25.460> be

the moment and at the moment man city is
improving<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:43.280> I'm<00:04:43.430> not<00:04:43.580> entirely<00:04:44.030> sure<00:04:44.240> that

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
improving so I'm not entirely sure that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.190 
improving so I'm not entirely sure that
Madison<00:04:45.440> University<00:04:45.850> will<00:04:46.850> finish<00:04:47.120> in<00:04:47.540> second
