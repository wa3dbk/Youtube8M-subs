00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 then following the previous sequence is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.800
 we are left in that we are going to cut their assets as a sacrifice 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.910
 you have to invest all your followers 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.080
 if we get back 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 photo ap a myth like hole without followers 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 minutes later also that we are going to place 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.500
 here in our taper 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 we have already placed 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 some materials 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.150
 for example 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
 the government spokesman 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.130
 until they are used for electrical connections what is this 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 we have contributed a small segment of approximately two centimeters 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.240
 to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 delpo used as filtering material 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 What may seem particular to the region 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 kings took red sokolova 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.230
 so 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.900
 to be continue 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 costs the changes here 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.620
 on both sides 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.620
 we are going to use some sponges that is normally used for 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.359
 times balance in the rulers a setback and his fiancé of cleanliness is 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.409
 a special plastic approach just like the meshes 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.049
 that will also serve us to be able to approve 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.569
 particles 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.099
 taxco the howitzers took off on both sides 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.779
 about the useful place 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.779
 we rescue other compatriots little more 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.779
 now I will be here to talk with 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.829
 all the world 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.909
 in a statement the water that was initially entering this area 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.980
 and it can be a particular suddenly alerted gilani in all countries the 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.149
 attt wait 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.760
 so they can catch the let's use this 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.099
 Of course, they use 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.829
 for the entrance of toilet 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.509
 but we have cut 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:58.360
 for what 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.639
 so that this serves as a buffer 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.219
 in this way he is placed fifth 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.099
 icon placed a lid 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.399
 and this is not going to raise signatures the water overflows here 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.209
 does not pass below I was going to take this area 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 to simply fill what we are going to place up 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.949
 this filtering material that is being 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.449
 it's like watching it 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.499
 that is used 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.799
 Kennedy so no longer 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 day 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.359
 So then this filtering material managed to place in this area 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.179
 chile we are here 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.219
 we can cut segments 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.939
 of sponge that goes and later in this area sara that did not go from egin yt 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.579
 if it does not overflow 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.519
 in this compartment that being third actually 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.439
 1 2 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.629
 we place day 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.499
 it is little special 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.489
 it was little simple to cut this way 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.489
 so that here I can and the water between 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 the compartments do not 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.509
 and in the final zone here 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.259
 we add to place 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.799
 eel can be pieces of ceramics 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 it can be percent and the libido in pieces 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.080
 here we have 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.969
 his face 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.870
 tejera nicolás and me too 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.729
 we have opted for your twin company 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.229
 sara that the new your fence no particle leave or so that will be 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.229
 easier also cleaning and we will place in that area 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.540
 in this way 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.939
 we have day 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.749
 here placed 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.430
 the ceramic 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 and all compartments ready 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 the water enters through this zone 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.139
 within this first dakar 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.759
 the particular before staying here overflow enter through these areas 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.349
 here in the lower part will also be housed percent 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.319
 the shards of material suddenly bendeck opposition that will help us 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.809
 that certain batteries are formed that will help us 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.479
 as percent 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.509
 so that the water can verify what correct way 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.009
 I read in this area we end up with the foal of the filtering material 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.689
 according to filtering ortega 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.779
 hoist water in this area 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.450
 now to be able to do this 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.349
 we need a judge 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.830
 a pump that carries the water that here 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.770
 and this time with this opportunity we will use a head to be able 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.770
 of this brand is a step not 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.789
 2,500 liters per hour that will be inside the pond 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.979
 let's connect 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.020
 these are here with a separate filter so you can enter the water not 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.309
 can and none then to large particles 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.309
 and at the top where the water comes out the flag was placed 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.819
 who is going to get to this area 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.089
 after this we will win our first filter or placed 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.669
 and in operation 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.669
 we put the lid 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.740
 we do not close 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.740
 quilmes 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.529
 very easy 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.309
 Now let's face it and we'll see it working 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.369
 site work two 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.439
 It has been done at night but 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.439
 there is 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.569
 sos 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.169
 thanks to everyone 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.169
 Until another chance 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.300
 here the fully functional cycle 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.300
 with your connection 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.039
 its drains 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.550
 if the following videos 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.210
 we will see how it is our is in crisis was the filtration 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:14.860
 if one is determined from nigeria 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.069
 thank you all we do not demos
