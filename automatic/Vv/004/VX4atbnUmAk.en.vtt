00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hi, I want to show you how to prepare 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.830
 a cup of green coffee now we are 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.950
 asking many customers for green coffee and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.590
 that has the property to control the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.539
 high blood sugar levels and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.800
 helps keep weight down 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.440
 body has a chlorogenic acid that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.830
 is what gives it the particularity that 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.770
 has been toasting it disappears so 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.780
 both green coffee has those 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.220
 properties is worth to prepare them very 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.110
 simple what we have to do is 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.420
 the green song beads we have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.420
 to move with a food processor 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.030
 ok we have the ground green coffee and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.940
 now let's proceed to do it is a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 cup we will use the coffee maker 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 plunger we could do it in another type 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
 of coffee makers in any other type I 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 I particularly recommend the gold one 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 ok so we have to do is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 put a spoonful of coffee for us 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 exactly like this coffee maker we are going to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.790
 load three cups 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.150
 therefore we put three tablespoons 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 this equals one tablespoon 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 approximately that are 79 grams of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 coffee once we have the coffee inside 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.450
 mill we add hot water and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.299
 and let's leave it here resting by itself 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.100
 normally about 4 or 5 thousand vouchers already 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.480
 after the 4 minutes now we are going to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.000
 press the plunger 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.920
 well now we have the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.230
 we have the coffee grounds in the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.120
 lower part and the filtered coffee in the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.920
 top part right now just simply 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.750
 we have to do is put our 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.750
 cup and serve us a cup of coffee 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.429
 something you can do would also be 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.470
 mixed green coffee roasted coffee with the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.880
 color would be more murky and it would be another 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.880
 way to take it
