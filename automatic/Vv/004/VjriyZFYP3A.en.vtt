00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.910
 hi to all this means in this video I wanted 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.099
 explain your test 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.849
 because maybe many have seen me 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.279
 I test my knives for my wife 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.390
 showing test removing chips from 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 eyes and it causes many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.380
 some misunderstanding misunderstanding for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 what is it doing here like me today 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 Came comments from one of my 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.940
 subscribers that we will still not 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 we will cut 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.650
 Of course surely no one to cut the guests 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.380
 It will do a knife to cut the nails of 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.320
 extreme idiocy just what 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.780
 what's the matter what's permissible buying 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.900
 some kind of production knife let's say 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.630
 Here in this case, it kizlyar crow 3 here 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.680
 or this one here is buying a knife or 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.520
 let's say this one we know very well 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.739
 which steel is the blade 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.450
 how much is it behind the knee if even 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.360
 the blade is not spelled 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.090
 it can always be found on the site 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.340
 manufacturer or some descriptions 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 because with many knives goes yet 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.770
 Dokumentik that is, a piece of paper is admissible here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.409
 this kizlyar crow 3 comes with a piece of paper 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450
 it’s not written on the blade and I ’m getting closer to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.930
 yourself a blade because you see such 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.790
 same fire where he already worked here and on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.990
 it is not written steel grade 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.940
 and even if it’s written that’s erased 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.270
 I will say it once and for all 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.479
 ask what kind of knife does brand mean 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 steel here but there is no paper that went to 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.729
 This knife certificate indicates the brand 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.689
 steel indicated quenching you and so on 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.000
 that's basically 99 percent of the time all 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.310
 this matches has instructions or on 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.850
 klingel and pointing paper here but 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 say here is such a knife is say 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.270
 homemade knife how do I know with what 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 steel he did and so we just 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.100
 take a knife and remove small chips 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 here and naturally we see that if 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.259
 chips are removed then legs 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 good if we do not bend the edge 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.619
 cutting edge 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.230
 it means good steel if cutting 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.239
 the edge is not painted 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.800
 it means good to become that is in principle 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.659
 it can be said folk method 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.629
 because it is clear that at home 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.819
 conditions have become very difficult 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.760
 and and confused also here's one brand 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.319
 stainless steel 2 3 4 stainless steel it all 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.080
 stainless steel principle 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.200
 here but somehow at home and and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.970
 experience this is unrealistic here is the end 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.519
 give some plant they will remove the micro 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.280
 paska they will make some kind of chemical 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.290
 analysis and will give you what kind of steel we are 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.599
 it is also very difficult to know which 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.760
 degree become tempered here because 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.349
 here you need to expose completely 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.019
 different processing completely different 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.319
 tests principle is his way to me 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.209
 taught a long time ago a blacksmith here he 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.519
 I also did records for housing 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.470
 this is someone else's knives here just without taking 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.940
 usually the eye does not need to hefty 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.280
 You can fuck a boat in general 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.200
 you will run and is removed from the nail pasca 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 here's the knife was made, in principle, I do not remember 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.470
 steel threes that is if the legs removes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.989
 it was from here that the chips became small 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.630
 then steel is fine here if again 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.299
 tell me vykraivaem not clogged 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.579
 the edge then too that they are beautiful and 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.310
 Well, and of course of course after 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.500
 the test must be possible to the eye will not 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.470
 you can see that is, we are not looking with your finger 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.530
 We feel we are not looking at our 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 cutting edge and of course after cutting 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.349
 nail 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.380
 check it says a piece of paper or somewhere 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.109
 still here about checking by voice it 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.819
 completely different conversation here so what 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.639
 he recommended not checking in principle 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.889
 on paper and on the skin that is to take 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.410
 pieces say shoulder belts of some kind of thick 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.079
 skin don't try to cut off a corner that is 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.900
 a good knife should cut the skin well 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.700
 but unfortunately I don’t have so much skin 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.220
 so that I can conduct tests on it 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.709
 Of course, if it will melt on the skin 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.930
 conduct tests but still here and 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.079
 also would like in this video you 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.359
 tell another one so to say advice 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.060
 let's try it on steel 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.980
 I gave him the same blacksmith I already 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.139
 mentioned 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.829
 but still, how would I gather all this into one 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.930
 video here let's say this stainless 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.610
 steel of course you can and test 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 somehow 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.189
 by chemical means, please 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.199
 pardon truly summer stainless steel 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.719
 or maybe it's some rusting 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.599
 steel or some kind of carbon and so on 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.939
 but in principle it is of course 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.449
 applies mainly to 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.169
 homemade knives 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.039
 that's because as i said 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.219
 knives we know by 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.509
 description of what kind of steel that's let herself 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.699
 poly is very difficult to learn 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.710
 Of course master Grisha I do 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.949
 stainless steel cool all 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.689
 but how do we know thats rust and on or 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.909
 No, the most basic way 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.050
 You can of course like washing yes but also so 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.990
 most can argue 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.120
 a pineapple blade will not stay with a stain 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.210
 this one from which will be very difficult 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.539
 rid and principle many years ago 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.580
 also one of my friends gave me legs 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.060
 very beautiful made legs but 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.949
 it turned out he became a decisive here on I 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.550
 I didn't know that on the blade a bit 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.699
 made 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.029
 youtube. literally put it became 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.909
 such a hard spot okay not the essence 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:34.389
 This has already been pressed there for a long time I do not have that 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.610
 there we just take the legs and open 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.710
 place open place that is with us in 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.719
 In this case, not blued 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.139
 edge of the blade or somewhere here by 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.839
 just try this back on the tongue 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.900
 if it is very acidic it means 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.009
 become rusting if slightly sour then 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.599
 maybe don't call 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.270
 and if not at all if someone is likely 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.870
 closer to the food stainless steel that is what 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.539
 steel 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.409
 less sour so she is closer to 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.449
 stainless 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.830
 and of course there are some push 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.139
 me here in at least such a knife 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.990
 no, but still I met some on 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.599
 knives are covered in chrome that's chrome it's in 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.120
 principle pretty strong coverage 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.520
 here all the same all the same happens that 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.650
 it is found that the knife is the most rusting 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.000
 steel and it's just chrome plated on top 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.960
 it is clear that if we have this knife 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 starting to drag 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.320
 that chrome is of course removed from us 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.330
 opens 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.620
 ordinary cutting edge too 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.120
 rusting steel 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.590
 Well, not the same can 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.570
 some kind of high carbon but 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.250
 yet it became rusting and therefore 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.270
 we need to cut neatly 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.310
 try the box 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.690
 steel ie opening steel from the same 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.730
 chromium here and then we can but of course 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.590
 not completely give him a chemical analysis but for 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.630
 ourselves we can understand let's say this 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.790
 stainless steel that's not in the district 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.800
 Here it is rusting Tanis personally of course 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.170
 here I am all stainless steel here I am to you 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.700
 example shown you can basically what 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.830
 try to understand what the language is 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.100
 nail and you will feel how much he 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.540
 sour because the body is still 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.210
 have some kind of acidity and 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.010
 metal oxidation occurs naturally 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.900
 and naturally therefore we feel 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.700
 acid but that's actually all i'm 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:15.050
 I wanted to say that I will repeat it again 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.500
 that knife if Kislev means it's rusting 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.600
 steel 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.820
 that is, the stronger the brush and sour with that 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.180
 it's more rusting so let's say steel than 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.260
 less acidic the closer to the stainless steel 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.200
 can you tell you to take the same again 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.840
 tail as a standard because as a bone 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.150
 we know rusting but rusting wrong 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.860
 what is carbon ki's say we 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.850
 we know that he is much faster 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.040
 rusts 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.800
 That principle is it possible to throw a puddle in 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.460
 wilderness lie a month and a little bit 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.290
 will take apathy again a piece of iron 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.600
 throw any puddle and what he literally 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.380
 in an hour, it will start to get shorter 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.360
 Well, we can also take a knife again and 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.220
 the same nail until you have a chip and 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.140
 we know how strong steel there is 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.540
 how good is it? 

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.490
 okay for the best so on I think everything 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.220
 it is clear if you have questions please 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.830
 finally ask one more 

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.800
 say a few words about sharpening before planing
