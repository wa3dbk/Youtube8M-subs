00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and stuck them on the incubator because

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
and stuck them on the incubator because
otherwise<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.190> can<00:01:35.370> get<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.580> bit<00:01:35.760> confusing<00:01:36.170> try

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to locate the manual to find out what

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.360 
to locate the manual to find out what
say<00:01:40.200> ca<00:01:40.680> means<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> found<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.830> writing<00:01:44.130> them

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
say ca means so found that writing them

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.010 
say ca means so found that writing them
on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> top<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> incubator<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.659> sticking

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
on the top of the incubator or sticking

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
on the top of the incubator or sticking
them<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.729> was<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.350> really<00:01:49.350> handy<00:01:49.860> tool

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
hols 48 eggs and it comes with a

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.010 
hols 48 eggs and it comes with a
automatic<00:02:07.049> Turner<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.780> lift

this up in here at the moment I've got
some<00:02:17.010> quail<00:02:17.340> eggs<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.000> I've<00:02:18.270> got<00:02:18.480> chicken

some quail eggs and I've got chicken

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.490 
some quail eggs and I've got chicken
eggs<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.390> I've<00:02:21.480> got<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.810> another

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
eggs you can see I've got a another

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.370 
eggs you can see I've got a another
other<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.519> thermometer<00:02:24.380> ascending

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
other this is a thermometer ascending

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:45.009 
other this is a thermometer ascending
unit<00:02:25.680> they're<00:02:27.319> sending<00:02:28.319> out<00:02:28.470> too

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.149 

the<00:02:46.019> reason<00:02:46.409> why<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.920> another

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
the reason why I have another

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.280 
the reason why I have another
thermometer<00:02:47.969> inside<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.659> because<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
thermometer inside is because the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.899 
thermometer inside is because the
temperature<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> outside<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.730> this

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.300 
degree on the outside or that it's
monitoring<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.359> works<00:03:24.919> correctly<00:03:25.919> on

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
monitoring so that it works correctly on

the inside so in my case of the long
40.5<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.829> it's<00:03:31.879> hovering<00:03:32.879> around<00:03:33.209> the

37 or thirty-six and a half mark it

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.949 
37 or thirty-six and a half mark it
fluctuates<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.669> little<00:03:38.909> bit<00:03:41.389> but<00:03:42.389> it's<00:03:42.900> pretty

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
fluctuates a little bit but it's pretty

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.830 
fluctuates a little bit but it's pretty
well<00:03:43.290> been<00:03:43.470> been<00:03:44.129> steady<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:45.000> top<00:03:45.449> you've<00:03:45.810> got

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
well been been steady on top you've got

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.540 
well been been steady on top you've got
some<00:03:46.109> viewing<00:03:46.440> holes

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.010 

and<00:03:50.700> at<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.000> moment<00:03:51.180> looks<00:03:51.570> like<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> doing

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
and at the moment looks like a doing

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.380 
and at the moment looks like a doing
quite<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.260> good<00:03:52.320> job<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.760> see<00:03:53.940> how<00:03:54.090> they<00:03:54.210> hatch

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
quite a good job to see how they hatch

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.110 
quite a good job to see how they hatch
out<00:03:55.340> that's<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.520> we're<00:03:56.670> up<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.940> at<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
out that's what we're up to at the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.710 
out that's what we're up to at the
moment<00:04:01.610> okay<00:04:02.610> now<00:04:02.910> I'm<00:04:03.000> getting<00:04:03.120> towards<00:04:03.660> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
moment okay now I'm getting towards the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.480 
moment okay now I'm getting towards the
end<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.260> my<00:04:04.790> Chinese<00:04:05.790> egg<00:04:06.090> incubator<00:04:06.480> critique

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
end of my Chinese egg incubator critique

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:15.080 
end of my Chinese egg incubator critique
or<00:04:08.490> review<00:04:09.800> it's<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.980> no-name<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.640> can<00:04:14.820> see

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
or review it's a no-name and I can see

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.170 
or review it's a no-name and I can see
now<00:04:15.360> with<00:04:15.690> my<00:04:15.870> hand<00:04:16.110> on<00:04:16.200> my<00:04:16.260> heart<00:04:16.610> that<00:04:17.610> this

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
now with my hand on my heart that this

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360 
now with my hand on my heart that this
Chinese<00:04:18.780> egg<00:04:19.140> incubator<00:04:19.680> has<00:04:20.100> been<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
Chinese egg incubator has been a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.180 
Chinese egg incubator has been a
resounding<00:04:20.760> success<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.810> why<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.190> while

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
resounding success and why is that while

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.910 
resounding success and why is that while
the<00:04:23.400> proof<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> hatching

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
the proof is in the hatching

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.610 
the proof is in the hatching
I've<00:04:25.920> hatched<00:04:26.250> out<00:04:26.460> more<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> best

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I've hatched out more if not the best

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.210 
I've hatched out more if not the best
ever

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
ever

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.320 
ever
tax<00:04:29.700> rate<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.210> I've<00:04:30.330> ever<00:04:30.450> done<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:32.330> so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
tax rate that I've ever done and so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.670 
tax rate that I've ever done and so
obviously<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.990> thing<00:04:34.170> keeps<00:04:34.410> the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
obviously the thing keeps the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.970 
obviously the thing keeps the
temperature<00:04:35.280> steady<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:36.410> not<00:04:37.410> only<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.830> i

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
temperature steady and not only have i

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.550 
temperature steady and not only have i
hatched<00:04:38.250> out<00:04:38.460> more<00:04:38.850> quail<00:04:39.480> i've<00:04:40.260> also

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
hatched out more quail i've also

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.160 
hatched out more quail i've also
combined<00:04:41.160> quail<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.880> chicken<00:04:42.270> eggs<00:04:42.480> which

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
combined quail with chicken eggs which

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.200 
combined quail with chicken eggs which
is<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.350> big<00:04:43.590> no-no<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.430> they<00:04:44.550> don't<00:04:44.760> recommend

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
is a big no-no and they don't recommend

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.410 
is a big no-no and they don't recommend
it<00:04:45.620> but<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.830> had<00:04:47.190> some<00:04:47.610> chicken<00:04:47.910> eggs<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.360> I

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
it but I had some chicken eggs that I

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.180 
it but I had some chicken eggs that I
wanted<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.870> done<00:04:49.140> but<00:04:49.440> at<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> same<00:04:49.890> time

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
wanted to get done but at the same time

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.910 
wanted to get done but at the same time
my<00:04:51.030> quail<00:04:51.390> season<00:04:51.690> was<00:04:52.050> coming<00:04:52.230> to<00:04:52.470> an<00:04:52.590> end<00:04:52.770> so

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
my quail season was coming to an end so

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.310 
my quail season was coming to an end so
I<00:04:52.950> needed<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.310> combine<00:04:53.630> put<00:04:54.630> some<00:04:54.780> quail<00:04:55.080> eggs

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
I needed to combine put some quail eggs

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.730 
I needed to combine put some quail eggs
at<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.130> time<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.550> year<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:57.750> at<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> same<00:04:58.440> time

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
at this time of year in at the same time

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.420 
at this time of year in at the same time
so<00:04:59.330> I've<00:05:00.330> done<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.110> it's<00:05:01.950> combined

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
so I've done that and it's combined

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.980 
so I've done that and it's combined
perfectly<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:03.420> I'll<00:05:03.510> show<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.750> what<00:05:03.900> I

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
perfectly and then I'll show you what I

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.920 
perfectly and then I'll show you what I
mean<00:05:04.140> I'm<00:05:04.380> at<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.650> end<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.980> my<00:05:05.160> quail<00:05:05.930> actually

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
mean I'm at the end of my quail actually

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.040 
mean I'm at the end of my quail actually
one<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.380> hatched<00:05:07.620> out<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.280> I'm<00:05:09.120> about<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.720> move

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
one is hatched out and I'm about to move

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.510 
one is hatched out and I'm about to move
them<00:05:10.350> now<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.830> breeder<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:12.470> probably

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
them now to the breeder and probably

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.860 
them now to the breeder and probably
half<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.550> chicken<00:05:15.030> eggs<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.450> hatched<00:05:15.480> out

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
half the chicken eggs have hatched out

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.640 
half the chicken eggs have hatched out
at<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.140> moment<00:05:16.590> it's<00:05:16.800> 22<00:05:17.460> days<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:19.380> the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
at the moment it's 22 days so the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.810 
at the moment it's 22 days so the
chicken<00:05:20.010> eggs<00:05:20.190> should<00:05:20.400> be<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:20.670> about

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
chicken eggs should be just about

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.450 
chicken eggs should be just about
finished<00:05:21.480> but<00:05:22.350> there<00:05:22.560> probably<00:05:22.590> might<00:05:23.070> be<00:05:23.250> one

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
finished but there probably might be one

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.310 
finished but there probably might be one
or<00:05:23.580> two<00:05:23.610> or<00:05:24.030> three<00:05:24.300> or<00:05:24.390> four<00:05:24.600> like<00:05:24.840> hatchings

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
or two or three or four like hatchings

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.580 
or two or three or four like hatchings
always<00:05:25.680> happens<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.670> last<00:05:26.970> quail<00:05:27.360> egg<00:05:27.600> was<00:05:28.560> a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
always happens this last quail egg was a

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.410 
always happens this last quail egg was a
late<00:05:29.010> hatching<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.580> about<00:05:29.850> three<00:05:30.150> or<00:05:30.240> four

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
late hatching of about three or four

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.170 
late hatching of about three or four
days<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:31.370> that's<00:05:32.370> how<00:05:32.580> things<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:33.120> go

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
days so that's how things can go

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.420 
days so that's how things can go
sometimes<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:33.990> can<00:05:34.140> have

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
sometimes you can have

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.080 
sometimes you can have
my<00:05:34.699> catcher<00:05:35.000> but<00:05:36.220> all<00:05:37.220> in<00:05:37.430> all<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.910> was<00:05:38.030> a

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
my catcher but all in all it was a

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.939 
my catcher but all in all it was a
complete<00:05:38.479> success<00:05:38.690> it's<00:05:39.350> a<00:05:39.470> bit<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.740> mess<00:05:39.919> in

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
complete success it's a bit of a mess in

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.090 
complete success it's a bit of a mess in
here<00:05:40.370> but<00:05:40.970> let's<00:05:41.290> have<00:05:42.290> a<00:05:42.380> look<00:05:42.560> now<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.800> alarm

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
here but let's have a look now the alarm

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:54.939 
here but let's have a look now the alarm
will<00:05:46.340> probably<00:05:46.610> go<00:05:46.729> off<00:05:46.910> here<00:05:53.199> because<00:05:54.199> the

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
will probably go off here because the

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.040 
will probably go off here because the
temperature<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.430> going<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.210> drop<00:05:56.270> quickly<00:05:56.840> and

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
temperature is going to drop quickly and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.659 
temperature is going to drop quickly and
the<00:05:57.169> King<00:05:57.350> individual<00:05:57.800> drop<00:05:58.010> so<00:05:58.250> that's<00:05:58.490> all

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
the King individual drop so that's all
