00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.820
 hi i am susan bowerman and today i 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.679
 show some variants to make lupus 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.450
 usually done with chickpeas but today 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.650
 we will use black beans 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 I will show you how easy it is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 prepare it we prepare a jar of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 black beans that I drained do not have them 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 rinsed only the intake of liquid 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 beans preserving a little because 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 I might need it if Lungu if 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.410
 should it become too thick I put 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.600
 beans in the food processor but you can 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.280
 also use the blender even if in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.260
 robot is easier 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.809
 normally lupus is prepared with 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 olive oil but us instead of oil 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.660
 olive 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.360
 we will use the lawyer to get some 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.850
 good extra fats is also to make it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 more creamy then in place of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 traditional lemon juice 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:02.699
 put some lime juice then a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.970
 pinch of salt pozzaglio these 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.860
 ingredients are optional by you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.049
 decide if you want a taste more or less 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.970
 strong I prefer strong flavors and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 so I put a bit of cumin in it, too 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the coriander we combine all the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.110
 ingredients 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.060
 then we close it in the lid and whip it 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.340
 until the dough becomes homogeneous 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 one thing I recommend is to check 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 always because if you see that it becomes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 too thick or if the engine starts at 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.659
 try too hard then add some 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 of liquid we start 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 looks good but is a little thick 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.750
 so we add some of the liquid of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.300
 not too much beans if it becomes too much 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.160
 liquid for just enough for 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.320
 give it a creamy consistency 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.320
 I continue to blend and here is the result 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:10.399
 and here is the result our onlus is 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.100
 ready and we will serve it with vegetables 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.420
 generally served with chips or 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.590
 corn flakes that are enough 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.810
 fat 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.819
 we will use the other vegetables instead 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.430
 what is beautiful about the humus it contains 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.860
 so many fibers and also proteins and therefore a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.630
 great snack and also you can keep it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.760
 in the fridge quietly even for 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.069
 a week or more without ruining it 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 it must be said that the black bean mousse 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.290
 it's not really attractive from the point of 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.930
 view of the color and for this I have 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.209
 preserved coriander to use as 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:47.750
 seal here it is ready to be 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.500
 served and enjoyed offer it to guests 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.500
 or use it as a good appetite snack
