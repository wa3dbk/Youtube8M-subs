00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello hello and welcome to practice in the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.050
 video of now I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.270
 a small box with plastic bottles 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.420
 in step number 1 where I am 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.450
 pointing you're going to cut with the knife 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.119
 remember that if you are very tiny and 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.310
 you want to use this tool you have 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 than doing it with adult supervision 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.780
 I also recommend you watch the video 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.540
 of the bell so you can reuse 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.740
 this part that you over the bottle 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.930
 these bottles have a line 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.410
 where I point you there, what are you going to cut 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.600
 when you already have a cylinder like this 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.290
 you are going to look for some lines that you have to 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.800
 the sides and you're going to bend exactly 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 where is the line 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.530
 that you're going to push very well with 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530
 your hands 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.830
 you're going to put a lot of pressure on him 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.580
 the lines that are well defined 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.920
 because that is part very, very, very 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 important for you to fit well this 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.280
 small box 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.970
 but these extremes are going to have to 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000
 cut 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.760
 what is left over and that is there 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.680
 dangerous now you're going to double again 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.490
 and the two lines that you already have made 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 you are going to join them 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 and two other lines 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.320
 on the other two sides based on the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.320
 of the two lines that you already have made 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.240
 ah 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.290
 the measure has to be left 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.370
 inch a quarter at all four ends 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.910
 from the box so you have to use 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.250
 a rule 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.980
 and a marker then you're just going to 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.190
 make a dot then with the scissors what 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.519
 you are going to cut exactly where is the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.519
 line 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.160
 very carefully 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.900
 and you have to do it for both 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.500
 ends the same step measure mark and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500
 then cut 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.110
 but so only what you have to 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.110
 do you are going to bend in 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.200
 the four tabs 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.210
 and with the help of your fingers you are going to mark 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.289
 the lines 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.500
 you are going to trim the tips in shape 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.510
 oval you do not have to cut it too much 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.510
 it's just to take away the corners 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.289
 with the rule 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:41.340
 upwards as I am doing 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.080
 you are going to form 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.080
 better the lines 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.379
 and now if you have your box ready and 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.389
 I hope you liked it and that the 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.449
 put into practice so you can 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.229
 give it away on any occasion and 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.000
 remember 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.759
 do not forget to subscribe to leave me your 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.150
 comments and like it until the 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.150
 next
