isn't<00:00:03.810> exactly<00:00:04.259> an<00:00:05.040> epic<00:00:05.759> build<00:00:06.060> here<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.109> you

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
isn't exactly an epic build here but you

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.009 
isn't exactly an epic build here but you
know<00:00:07.529> just<00:00:08.280> boasting<00:00:08.820> something<00:00:09.300> just

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
know just boasting something just

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.690 
know just boasting something just
because<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.800> had<00:00:10.920> free<00:00:11.280> time<00:00:11.519> during<00:00:12.420> lunch<00:00:12.809> and

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
because I had free time during lunch and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700 
because I had free time during lunch and
so<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.630> was<00:00:15.870> brought<00:00:16.139> browsing<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
so you know was brought browsing the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.170 
so you know was brought browsing the
internet<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> saw<00:00:17.850> several<00:00:18.330> people<00:00:18.779> doing<00:00:19.170> or

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
internet and saw several people doing or

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.990 
internet and saw several people doing or
several<00:00:21.180> videos<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.619> entire<00:00:23.490> piston

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
several videos with the entire piston

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.140 
several videos with the entire piston
monorail<00:00:24.359> designs<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.730> mean<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.119> know

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
monorail designs and I mean I know

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
monorail designs and I mean I know
they're<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.900> year<00:00:28.380> old<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.400> know

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
they're like a year old and you know

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.260 
they're like a year old and you know
pretty<00:00:30.980> over<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.219> already<00:00:32.520> by<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.000> point

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty over down already by this point

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
pretty over down already by this point
but<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.380> had<00:00:34.500> some<00:00:34.710> free<00:00:34.920> time<00:00:34.950> during

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
but I just had some free time during

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.389 
but I just had some free time during
lunch<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> 30<00:00:36.870> minutes<00:00:37.140> later<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.710> had<00:00:38.040> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
lunch and 30 minutes later I had this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.170 
lunch and 30 minutes later I had this
design<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.780> quite<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.980> simpler<00:00:41.850> than

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
design which is quite a bit simpler than

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
design which is quite a bit simpler than
what<00:00:43.020> I've<00:00:43.140> seen<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.000> works<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.300> faster<00:00:46.070> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
what I've seen and works a lot faster so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.920 
what I've seen and works a lot faster so
that's<00:00:47.309> actually<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:47.850> original<00:00:48.360> design<00:00:48.390> had

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
that's actually my original design had

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
that's actually my original design had
three<00:00:49.230> levels<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.879> about

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
three levels and just when I was about

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.470 
three levels and just when I was about
to<00:00:51.270> publish<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> video<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.289> figured<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
to publish the video i figured that

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
to publish the video i figured that
figure<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> top<00:00:55.350> player<00:00:55.800> was

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
figure it out that the top player was

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
figure it out that the top player was
actually<00:00:56.640> redundant<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.559> new

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
actually redundant so this is the new

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
actually redundant so this is the new
and<00:00:59.399> improved<00:00:59.460> version<00:01:00.180> alert<00:01:00.480> II<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.829> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and improved version alert II and it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.479 
and improved version alert II and it
works<00:01:02.100> rather<00:01:02.480> simple<00:01:03.480> you've<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.489> both

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
works rather simple you've got the both

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.859 
works rather simple you've got the both
clock<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.650> two<00:01:07.920> tix<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
clock here with just two tix and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
clock here with just two tix and
comparators<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.740> rather<00:01:11.460> simple<00:01:11.970> thing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
comparators you know rather simple thing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
comparators you know rather simple thing
and<00:01:12.450> simply<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:14.060> double<00:01:15.650> George

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and simply because of this double George

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
and simply because of this double George
it<00:01:17.100> offsets<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.390> power<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.380> enough<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it offsets the power just enough to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.690 
it offsets the power just enough to
allow<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> happen<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> set<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
allow this to happen so you set off the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.149 
allow this to happen so you set off the
piston<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:25.170> set<00:01:25.890> off<00:01:26.070> another<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
piston and you set off another one and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
piston and you set off another one and
there<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.250> goes<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.960> pretty

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
there it goes as you can see it's pretty

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
there it goes as you can see it's pretty
fast<00:01:31.650> you've<00:01:32.579> got<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> redstone<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
fast you've got all the redstone is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.819 
fast you've got all the redstone is
pretty<00:01:34.560> simple<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.729> compact<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> yeah

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pretty simple and compact it's so yeah

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.340 
pretty simple and compact it's so yeah
that's<00:01:37.950> basically<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.450> as

that's basically all I have you know as
I<00:01:40.560> said<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.189> an<00:01:42.200> insanely<00:01:44.990> large<00:01:45.990> billet

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I said it's not an insanely large billet

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.300 
I said it's not an insanely large billet
or<00:01:46.740> anything<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.750> you've<00:01:48.869> got

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
30 minutes of time as compared to one

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.219 
30 minutes of time as compared to one
month<00:01:52.579> that's<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> hopefully
