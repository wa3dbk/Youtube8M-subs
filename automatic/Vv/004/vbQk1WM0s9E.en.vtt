show you how to make a memory wire

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.599 
show you how to make a memory wire
bracelet<00:01:54.779> without<00:01:55.169> really<00:01:55.380> needing<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:56.009> buy<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
bracelet without really needing to buy a

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.969 
bracelet without really needing to buy a
lot<00:01:56.849> of<00:01:56.999> extra<00:01:57.329> stuff<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.889> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
lot of extra stuff so I'm just going to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.699 
lot of extra stuff so I'm just going to
take<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.729> round<00:02:00.329> nose<00:02:00.450> pliers<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
take my round nose pliers I'm going to

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.339 
take my round nose pliers I'm going to
grip<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.369> end<00:02:02.609> of<00:02:03.029> the<00:02:03.119> memory<00:02:03.450> wire<00:02:03.630> between

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
grip the end of the memory wire between

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.709 
grip the end of the memory wire between
the<00:02:04.709> two<00:02:04.739> noses<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:06.209> just<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the two noses and I'm just going to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.249 
the two noses and I'm just going to
rotate<00:02:07.409> around<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> see<00:02:09.690> I'm<00:02:09.780> creating<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
rotate around you can see I'm creating a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.229 
rotate around you can see I'm creating a
little<00:02:10.410> loop<00:02:10.679> right<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:10.950> I'm<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.120> going

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
little loop right there I'm just going

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.960 
little loop right there I'm just going
to<00:02:12.300> finish<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.780> off<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.310> either<00:02:14.610> leave<00:02:14.940> it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to finish it off you can either leave it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.000 
to finish it off you can either leave it
like<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> or<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.020> wanted<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.800> a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
like that or if you wanted it to be a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.410 
like that or if you wanted it to be a
little<00:02:17.280> bit<00:02:17.430> straighter<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.960> bend

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
little bit straighter you can just bend

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.160 
little bit straighter you can just bend
back<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> stop<00:02:22.840> my

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
back like so so that is going to stop my

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.130 
back like so so that is going to stop my
beads<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.740> that's<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.160> really<00:02:24.520> need<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> do

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
beads and that's all I really need to do

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580 
beads and that's all I really need to do
so<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.770> go<00:02:26.920> ahead<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.540> cut<00:02:29.170> open<00:02:29.560> my

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
so I'm going to go ahead and cut open my

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.410 
so I'm going to go ahead and cut open my
beads<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.490> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.730> start<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.180> color

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
beads I'm going to start with this color

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740 
beads I'm going to start with this color
here<00:02:31.750> take<00:02:32.470> them<00:02:32.590> off<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.950> strand<00:02:33.280> oh<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:34.480> did

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
here take them off the strand oh I did

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.270 
here take them off the strand oh I did
forget<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.020> show<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.410> little<00:02:35.560> tip<00:02:35.980> with

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
forget to show you the little tip with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.790 
forget to show you the little tip with
the<00:02:36.430> tape<00:02:36.670> okay<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.780> if<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.110> had<00:02:38.290> not<00:02:38.440> already

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the tape okay so if I had not already

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.560 
the tape okay so if I had not already
done<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.550> know<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.270> I'm<00:02:40.330> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> do

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
done this so I know what I'm going to do

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.790 
done this so I know what I'm going to do
I'm<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> stripe<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
I'm going to do a stripe of this a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.890 
I'm going to do a stripe of this a
stripe<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.730> stripe<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.209> but

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
stripe of this and stripe of that but

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.720 
stripe of this and stripe of that but
perhaps<00:02:44.110> you're<00:02:44.470> creating<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.980> project<00:02:45.220> where

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
perhaps you're creating a project where

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
perhaps you're creating a project where
you<00:02:45.880> don't<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:47.410> order<00:02:47.770> of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
you don't really know what order of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.320 
you don't really know what order of
beads<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.370> want<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.640> string<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:48.910> your<00:02:49.060> memory

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
beads you want to string on your memory

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.540 
beads you want to string on your memory
wire<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.500> could<00:02:50.739> start<00:02:51.010> by<00:02:51.190> making<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
wire so you could start by making a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.780 
wire so you could start by making a
little<00:02:51.760> simple<00:02:52.090> wire<00:02:52.209> loop<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:54.489> what

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
little simple wire loop and then what

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.220 
little simple wire loop and then what
would<00:02:54.880> happen<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.330> you'd<00:02:55.480> string<00:02:55.780> some<00:02:55.989> beads

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
would happen is you'd string some beads

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.750 
would happen is you'd string some beads
if<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.590> don't<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.920> them<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.280> would<00:02:57.489> take

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
if you don't like them you would take

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.120 
if you don't like them you would take
them<00:02:57.940> all<00:02:58.090> off<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.660> then<00:02:58.830> restring<00:02:59.830> them<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
them all off and then restring them and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.920 
them all off and then restring them and
repeat<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.670> process<00:03:00.730> until<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.480> were<00:03:01.570> happy

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
repeat that process until you were happy

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.890 
repeat that process until you were happy
with<00:03:01.959> your<00:03:02.170> design<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.430> what<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.239> like<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.780> do

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
with your design but what I like to do

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.320 
with your design but what I like to do
if<00:03:05.019> I'm<00:03:05.140> unsure<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.640> take<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.180> end

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
if I'm unsure is I like to take the end

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.060 
if I'm unsure is I like to take the end
now<00:03:07.780> let's<00:03:07.930> pretend<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.410> don't<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:08.860> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
now let's pretend I don't have that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.009 
now let's pretend I don't have that
there<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.640> was<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.510> was<00:03:10.630> going<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.959> be

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
there and this was what was going to be

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.410 
there and this was what was going to be
my<00:03:11.140> end<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:12.370> put<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.580> little<00:03:12.880> piece<00:03:13.209> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
my end and just put a little piece of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.580 
my end and just put a little piece of
tape<00:03:13.810> over<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.350> as<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:15.630> stopper<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.260> now<00:03:17.410> what

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
tape over it as a stopper so now what

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
tape over it as a stopper so now what
would<00:03:17.680> happen<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.190> let's<00:03:18.430> say<00:03:18.640> I've<00:03:18.970> strung<00:03:19.510> my

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
would happen is let's say I've strung my

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.540 
would happen is let's say I've strung my
beads<00:03:19.870> I've<00:03:20.110> got<00:03:20.350> maybe<00:03:20.560> three<00:03:20.830> four<00:03:21.070> coils

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
beads I've got maybe three four coils

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.610 
beads I've got maybe three four coils
but<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:21.970> don't<00:03:22.239> really<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.840> first<00:03:23.140> couple

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
but I don't really like the first couple

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.890 
but I don't really like the first couple
beads<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.940> strung<00:03:25.299> well<00:03:25.510> instead<00:03:25.840> of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
beads that I strung well instead of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
beads that I strung well instead of
having<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.320> unwind<00:03:26.950> all<00:03:27.340> your<00:03:27.730> beads<00:03:27.910> take

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
having to unwind all your beads take

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.479 
having to unwind all your beads take
them<00:03:28.390> all<00:03:28.600> off<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.890> these<00:03:30.010> end<00:03:30.250> ones

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
them all off to get to these end ones

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.830 
them all off to get to these end ones
you<00:03:30.730> would<00:03:30.820> just<00:03:30.940> take<00:03:31.150> your<00:03:31.329> piece<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> tape

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
you would just take your piece of tape

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.890 
you would just take your piece of tape
off<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.380> then<00:03:33.280> slip<00:03:33.700> them<00:03:33.880> off<00:03:34.030> this<00:03:34.299> end<00:03:34.630> and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
off and then slip them off this end and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.630 
off and then slip them off this end and
then<00:03:35.440> replace<00:03:35.920> whatever<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.430> want<00:03:36.579> to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
then replace whatever you want to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.729 
then replace whatever you want to
replace<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.390> there's<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> lot<00:03:38.380> easier

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
replace them with there's a lot easier

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.310 
replace them with there's a lot easier
is<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.010> nice<00:03:39.430> time<00:03:39.820> saver<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.200> this

is that this nice time saver but in this

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.110 
is that this nice time saver but in this

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.610 
the string that they came on again these
are<00:03:49.720> Czech<00:03:49.989> glass

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.990 
thought they'd be perfect for this type
of<00:03:56.890> project<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:59.010> alright<00:04:00.010> memory<00:04:00.850> wire

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000

sometimes<00:04:01.570> like<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.590> could<00:04:02.769> see<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.010> kind

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
sometimes like you could see I just kind

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.770 
sometimes like you could see I just kind
of<00:04:03.310> unwound<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.910> right<00:04:04.090> there<00:04:04.299> but<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.660> will

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
of unwound it right there but it will

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.199

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
wonderful and I'm just going to place
the<00:04:09.910> beads<00:04:10.180> onto<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:11.140> memory<00:04:11.410> wire

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.560 

and<00:04:21.100> then<00:04:21.280> what<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.699> to<00:04:21.850> do<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.150> after<00:04:22.449> I've

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and then what I like to do is after I've

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.150 
and then what I like to do is after I've
got<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.720> couple<00:04:22.990> on<00:04:23.199> here<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.979> make<00:04:24.130> sure

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
got a couple on here I like to make sure

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.950 
got a couple on here I like to make sure
they<00:04:24.400> scoot<00:04:24.699> down<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.120> bottom<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.720> just

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
they scoot down to the bottom so I just

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.879 
they scoot down to the bottom so I just
hold<00:04:26.260> my<00:04:26.440> memory<00:04:26.740> wire<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:28.600> kind<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.960> twirl

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
hold my memory wire and I kind of twirl

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.610 
hold my memory wire and I kind of twirl
them<00:04:30.040> down<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.460> then<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.750> loop<00:04:32.080> we<00:04:32.350> made<00:04:32.530> to

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
them down and then that loop we made to

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.770 
them down and then that loop we made to
begin<00:04:32.710> with<00:04:32.979> acts<00:04:33.220> as<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.030> should<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.479> stops

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
begin with acts as it should it stops

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.409 
begin with acts as it should it stops
the<00:04:35.050> beads<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.470> I'm<00:04:35.620> just<00:04:35.800> going<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:35.949> continue

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
the beads and I'm just going to continue

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.469 
the beads and I'm just going to continue
stringing<00:04:37.419> my<00:04:37.570> beads<00:04:37.600> onto<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.380> wire<00:04:42.479> that

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
stringing my beads onto the wire that

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.189 
stringing my beads onto the wire that
colors<00:04:43.930> done<00:04:45.240> twirl<00:04:46.240> them<00:04:46.510> down<00:04:46.720> it's

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
colors done twirl them down it's

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.159 
colors done twirl them down it's
actually<00:04:47.320> pretty<00:04:47.680> fun<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.039> do<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.990> okay<00:04:50.020> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
I am ready to start my next color so

I am ready to start my next color so
just<00:04:55.150> going<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.389> cut<00:04:55.570> this

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140

and I'm going to get this one ready and
I'll<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.730> follow<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.150> exact<00:05:09.450> same<00:05:09.480> process

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.370 

okay<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.780> have<00:05:22.080> strung<00:05:22.920> all<00:05:23.100> my<00:05:23.280> beads<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.820> I've

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
okay I have strung all my beads and I've

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.600 
okay I have strung all my beads and I've
gone<00:05:25.380> ahead<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:25.800> slipped<00:05:26.130> them<00:05:26.250> down<00:05:26.460> to

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
gone ahead and I slipped them down to

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.090 
gone ahead and I slipped them down to
the<00:05:26.700> end<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.480> now<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.690> finish<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.260> you're<00:05:28.860> going

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
the end so now to finish it you're going

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.580 
the end so now to finish it you're going
to<00:05:29.190> make<00:05:29.370> sure<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:30.750> your<00:05:30.900> beads<00:05:31.110> are<00:05:31.350> tight

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
to make sure that your beads are tight

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.670 
to make sure that your beads are tight
that<00:05:31.800> there's<00:05:31.950> no<00:05:32.070> big<00:05:32.700> gaps<00:05:33.030> in<00:05:33.360> there<00:05:33.680> and

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
that there's no big gaps in there and

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.290 
that there's no big gaps in there and
you're<00:05:34.830> going<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.070> want<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.310> go<00:05:35.460> ahead<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.910> cut

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
you're going to want to go ahead and cut

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.460 
you're going to want to go ahead and cut
your<00:05:36.480> memory<00:05:36.810> wire<00:05:37.790> about<00:05:39.050> fourth<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.230> an<00:05:40.320> inch

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
your memory wire about fourth of an inch

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.850 
your memory wire about fourth of an inch
maybe<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:41.040> tad<00:05:41.550> bit<00:05:41.850> more<00:05:42.320> from<00:05:43.320> your<00:05:43.920> last<00:05:44.100> bead

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
maybe a tad bit more from your last bead

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.980 
maybe a tad bit more from your last bead
there<00:05:46.860> we<00:05:46.980> go<00:05:47.390> and<00:05:48.390> we're<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.690> going<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:48.930> do

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
there we go and we're just going to do

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.300 
there we go and we're just going to do
the<00:05:49.080> same<00:05:49.260> technique<00:05:49.530> we<00:05:49.740> did<00:05:49.980> before<00:05:50.220> we're

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
the same technique we did before we're

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.060 
the same technique we did before we're
going<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.460> grab<00:05:50.790> that<00:05:50.820> end<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:52.040> we're<00:05:53.040> going

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
going to grab that end and we're going
