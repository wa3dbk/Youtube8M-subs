because you know for example in winter

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.310 
because you know for example in winter
you<00:00:59.679> want<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.070> course<00:01:00.129> want<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:01.089> heat<00:01:01.359> now

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
to control the thermo called the app and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.080 
to control the thermo called the app and
let's<00:04:04.080> say<00:04:04.320> your<00:04:04.709> husband<00:04:05.160> or<00:04:05.430> my<00:04:05.700> husband

let's say your husband or my husband
also<00:04:06.269> has<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.750> thermal<00:04:07.140> call<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.670> also

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
also has the thermal call so I can also

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.449 
also has the thermal call so I can also
turn<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.480> on<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.870> off<00:04:10.049> if<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.530> switch<00:04:10.799> cars<00:04:11.160> for

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
turn it on and off if we switch cars for

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.509 
turn it on and off if we switch cars for
example<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.799> set<00:04:14.010> up<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
example then you have to set up the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.250 
example then you have to set up the
other<00:04:14.880> settings

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
other settings

status is there you go

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.520 
status is there you go
so<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:47.400> parking<00:05:47.880> heater<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.330> off<00:05:48.540> as<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.140> 12

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
so the parking heater is off as it is 12

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.070 
so the parking heater is off as it is 12
degrees<00:05:49.740> outside<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.520> my<00:05:51.030> battery<00:05:51.390> voltage

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
degrees outside and my battery voltage

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.130 
degrees outside and my battery voltage
is<00:05:52.320> 12<00:05:52.680> point<00:05:53.040> 7<00:05:53.520> volts<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.240> it's<00:05:54.630> also<00:05:54.810> nice<00:05:55.080> to

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
is 12 point 7 volts so it's also nice to

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.480 
is 12 point 7 volts so it's also nice to
know<00:05:55.440> just<00:05:55.860> in<00:05:55.980> case<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:57.330> run<00:05:57.600> out<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:57.840> battery

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
know just in case you run out of battery

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.670 
know just in case you run out of battery
so

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.879 

so<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.520> last<00:06:04.759> button<00:06:05.090> that's<00:06:06.080> left<00:06:06.470> is<00:06:06.710> the
