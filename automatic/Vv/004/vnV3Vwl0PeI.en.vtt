00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.580
 the sinval is only in the maternal 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 but his purchases of school supplies 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.450
 seem to be students of elementary school 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.549
 the whole list amounts to almost two hundred reais 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 surprise to his mother's pocket he expected a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 just for his age, I was 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 that is to be a little less around 100 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 A little bit but I believe you will stay 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.199
 More than that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.140
 the beginning of the year is heavy beyond ipva and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.109
 iptu who has children also spends 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 school purchases this year because of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.300
 School drinks begin early. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 already at the end of January the parents had to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.399
 anticipate and the stores are already 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.710
 during the first week of the year 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.500
 a movement of about 20 to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 30 percent with the peak of 50% up to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.110
 last week before the start of the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 construction 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.460
 this bookstore was prepared to offer 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.949
 an average purchase budget 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.500
 according to the college and the school year 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 of the student the relation is made taking in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 account for cheaper items but the purchase 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.339
 It can get more salty. 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 depending on the product the variation of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.990
 price can be very large this backpack 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.820
 here for example it goes for 25 reais 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.189
 but if the student chooses one as 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 this one is personalized from 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.369
 cartoon character she leaves 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 with 180 reais or 600 and 20% more 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.439
 dude why it 's so important to know 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 negotiate with the children at the time of purchase 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.770
 of material 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.790
 was what flavia did with the enzo of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 five years 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.070
 the case was the one that chose but the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.140
 other items will be at the discretion of the mother 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.780
 the main items as I am today a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 backpack he already chooses always want from 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.750
 character 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 but I try to reconcile material that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.420
 has a character with material that has no 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.369
 even to not waste so much and this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.149
 if you have characters are always more 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 expensive 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.619
 In addition, it is good to pay 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 attention in the complete list of materials 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.310
 that the school requested the account can 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 endear the college do abuse 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 it can not exist material of use 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 which are the inputs of the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.819
 should be for the trust already 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 we are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.069
 the value of monthly payments, for example 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.439
 inside the disposable cup soap 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.299
 excess paper and which are used 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.719
 for secretarial material and material 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.739
 and hygienic office are 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.129
 those materials that do not usually 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.379
 are part of the student's didactics 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.950
 If this happens, parents should seek 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.950
 the procon
