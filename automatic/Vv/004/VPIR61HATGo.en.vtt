today I'll be talking about the new

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.749 
today I'll be talking about the new
wallet<00:00:28.349> drone<00:00:28.589> which<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.249> a<00:00:29.279> brand<00:00:29.519> new

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
wallet drone which is a brand new

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.399 
wallet drone which is a brand new
quadcopter<00:00:30.419> that's<00:00:30.599> actually<00:00:30.929> being<00:00:31.169> billed

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
quadcopter that's actually being billed

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.470 
quadcopter that's actually being billed
as<00:00:31.589> the<00:00:31.619> world's<00:00:32.040> very<00:00:32.279> smallest<00:00:32.700> roll<00:00:33.150> now

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
as the world's very smallest roll now

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
as the world's very smallest roll now
what's<00:00:33.660> amazing<00:00:33.900> is<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> drone<00:00:34.590> itself

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
what's amazing is that the drone itself

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
what's amazing is that the drone itself
isn't<00:00:35.340> actually<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> size<00:00:36.060> udoit<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.840> fact

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
isn't actually the size udoit in fact

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.870 
isn't actually the size udoit in fact
it's<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:37.710> smaller<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
it's actually a lot smaller than that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.610 
it's actually a lot smaller than that
the<00:00:39.150> tiny<00:00:39.420> quadcopter<00:00:40.050> fits<00:00:40.230> inside<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the tiny quadcopter fits inside a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
the tiny quadcopter fits inside a
controller<00:00:41.070> box<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.090> controller<00:00:42.630> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
controller box and that controller is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.090 
controller box and that controller is
the<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.470> size<00:00:43.650> of<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.920> wallet

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the one that's the size of your wallet

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.890 
the one that's the size of your wallet
letting<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> carry<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> drone<00:00:45.510> pretty<00:00:45.750> much

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
letting you carry this drone pretty much

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.080 
letting you carry this drone pretty much
wherever<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.560> go<00:00:46.830> now<00:00:47.580> a<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.760> professional

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
wherever you go now a more professional

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
wherever you go now a more professional
drone<00:00:48.540> users<00:00:48.780> might<00:00:49.080> question<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.590> sanity<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
drone users might question the sanity is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.070 
drone users might question the sanity is
such<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> small<00:00:50.700> flying<00:00:50.940> robot<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.810> they<00:00:51.900> might

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
such a small flying robot but they might

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.900 
such a small flying robot but they might
be<00:00:52.200> missing<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> points<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:53.520> drone<00:00:53.790> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
be missing the points this drone is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.370 
be missing the points this drone is
built<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.210> nothing<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.660> fine<00:00:54.900> on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.200> go

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
built for nothing but fine on the go

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.110 
built for nothing but fine on the go
this<00:00:55.830> is<00:00:56.010> pretty<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.550> first<00:00:56.760> stone<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this is pretty much the first stone that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.550 
this is pretty much the first stone that
you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.330> carry<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:57.780> bag<00:00:58.080> and<00:00:58.380> fly

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
you can carry in your bag and fly

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.250 
you can carry in your bag and fly
whenever<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.280> wherever<00:00:59.610> you<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.080> now<00:01:01.080> what

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
whenever and wherever you want now what

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.510 
whenever and wherever you want now what
is<00:01:01.320> interesting<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.040> wallet<00:01:02.340> shown

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is interesting about the wallet shown

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
is interesting about the wallet shown
though<00:01:02.700> is<00:01:02.850> actually<00:01:02.970> not<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.510> drone<00:01:03.690> itself

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
though is actually not the drone itself

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
though is actually not the drone itself
but<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> controller<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.640> controller

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
but it's the controller the controller

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.489 
but it's the controller the controller
is<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> size<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> wall<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:07.499 
is about the size of a wall that

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.230 
is about the size of a wall that
actually<00:01:07.829> houses<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.399> drone<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.820> start<00:01:09.119> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
actually houses the drone gonna start in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
actually houses the drone gonna start in
use<00:01:09.509> but<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.259> also<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> another<00:01:10.770> trick<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.310> can

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
use but it also is another trick you can

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.889 
use but it also is another trick you can
actually<00:01:11.579> charge<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.179> drone<00:01:12.509> as<00:01:12.659> well

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
actually charge the drone as well

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.020 
actually charge the drone as well
everything<00:01:13.859> is<00:01:13.950> powered<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.249> four<00:01:14.340> double<00:01:14.909> A

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
everything is powered by four double A

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.029 
everything is powered by four double A
batteries<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.719> in<00:01:15.840> theory<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.679> have<00:01:16.799> non

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
batteries so in theory you can have non

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.679 
batteries so in theory you can have non
stop<00:01:17.340> flying<00:01:17.549> fun<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.119> long<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.569> have<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
stop flying fun as long as you have a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.959 
stop flying fun as long as you have a
supply<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.109> batteries<00:01:19.499> with<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.640> said

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
supply of batteries with you that said

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.760 
supply of batteries with you that said
the<00:01:21.149> drone<00:01:21.299> itself<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.840> fly<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.380> 15

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the drone itself can fly for a good 15

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
the drone itself can fly for a good 15
minutes<00:01:22.799> before<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.369> needs<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.850> recharged

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
minutes before it needs to be recharged

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.330 
minutes before it needs to be recharged
and<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.289> point<00:01:25.499> you<00:01:25.679> actually<00:01:25.829> need<00:01:26.219> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and at that point you actually need to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.399

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
for everyone else I think this

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.760 
for everyone else I think this
quadcopter<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.259> sale<00:01:49.560> and

stores just a little bit later but it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.449 
stores just a little bit later but it
shouldn't<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.289> after<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.039> if<00:01:53.310> you're
