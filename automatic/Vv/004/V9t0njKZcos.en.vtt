00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that shoots out of the shield and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.130 
that shoots out of the shield and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
actually does a lot of damage so i'll

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 
actually does a lot of damage so i'll
show<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.850> five<00:00:44.850> words

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
show you right here five words

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810 
show you right here five words
compressed<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.140> two<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.700> look

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
compressed are two right there and look

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.660 
compressed are two right there and look
at<00:00:47.969> most<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.899> most<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> his<00:00:49.710> HP<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.160> gone<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
at most of it most of his HP is gone and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
at most of it most of his HP is gone and
then<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.920> easy<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.690> doing<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> shield

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
then it's as easy as doing the shield

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.470 
then it's as easy as doing the shield
attack<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> smacking<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.930> clam<00:00:57.930> once<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
attack and smacking the clam once and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
attack and smacking the clam once and
the<00:01:00.480> cool<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.289> staggers<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the cool thing is that it staggers the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
the cool thing is that it staggers the
clamp<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:03.000> they're<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> middle<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> an

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
clamp so if they're in the middle of an

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
clamp so if they're in the middle of an
attack<00:01:04.250> you're<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.610> hit<00:01:05.790> if

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
attack you're not going to get hit if

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.950 
attack you're not going to get hit if
you<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.020> first

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 

you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.680> probably<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.729> five<00:01:12.659> or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can probably do this about five or

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
you can probably do this about five or
six<00:01:13.049> times<00:01:13.140> before<00:01:13.680> having<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> repair<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
six times before having to repair the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.980 
six times before having to repair the
shield<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:16.440> even<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:18.510> shield<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
shield but even then the the shield is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.790 
shield but even then the the shield is
just<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.040> cheap<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:21.320> repair<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.590> think

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
just your really cheap to repair I think

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.109 
just your really cheap to repair I think
one<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.159> clamps<00:01:23.490> gives<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> enough

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
one of these clamps gives you enough

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.370 
one of these clamps gives you enough
