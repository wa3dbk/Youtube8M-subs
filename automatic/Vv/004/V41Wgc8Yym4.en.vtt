00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello with you alex beach after 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.609
 March presentation apple on the Internet 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.980
 there were a lot of questions about 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.099
 of the main innovations of the new macbook is 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.740
 yuzbi thai but makbuki just one 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:23.640
 port and where are all the rest let's 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:25.830
 we will understand and so what is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.970
 this standard is usb type-c 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 or abbreviated with besie I recently found out 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 that the idea of ​​creating it first arrived 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 from apple that it was developed 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 parallel with lightning, only one port 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 accommodates your displayport 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 charging hdmi and visions is exactly that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 new in the near future will be 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.699
 introduced in many gadgets promotion 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 cupertino people and companies 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.059
 joined and google which included 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 to your updated google chromebook 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 pixel chromebook not one but two 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 usb connector c 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 why apple has introduced but only one 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 output according to their opinion time flash drives already 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.540
 as well as the time of the disks which 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.510
 passed and people really less and less 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.790
 use flash drives 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.800
 everything was invented to transplant 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.390
 users on cloud services 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.760
 despite the fact that many do not have enough 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 Internet speeds to transfer a file 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.550
 through the rockbox 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 aiklaud or something else fresh 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.050
 standard allows you to use it in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.480
 devices of any type from personal 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.280
 computers and ultra-thin laptops to 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.720
 smartphones tablets and other equipment 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.390
 it only seems to me that iPhones and iPads 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.000
 under this wave will not fall from their lightning 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.130
 we will then be like a step back since he 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.400
 on one and one millimeter thinner than u es 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.150
 bsi 1 and a half millimeter a 2 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.520
 2 and 6 millimeters 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.280
 but let's see which one of them will win 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.320
 the issue of solidity and strength say 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.450
 you honestly for the last six months I have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.080
 flew and already a few cables from my 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.280
 iphone and ipad 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.440
 pleased that the connector type b 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.240
 symmetrical so users 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 no longer have to guess which 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.610
 side to insert the USB flash drive into the computer with 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.050
 you can do it at all without looking 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 certainly the appropriate cable is also 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.170
 double sided with identical convectors 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.570
 on both sides 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 therefore it is possible to connect it to 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.150
 device to any end as well as 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.090
 beaten psy compatible with usb standard 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.220
 3 1 2 generation data exchange rate 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.850
 through it can be very 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.420
 high 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.880
 up to 10 gigabits per second is about 125 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.540
 kb per second you can imagine 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.090
 imagine 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 good quality movie size 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.340
 approximately 8 gigabytes can be reset 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.320
 in a little more than 10 seconds i'm not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.240
 talking about other documents there you are not 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.540
 have time to blink as your file will be 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920
 transferred to your com still him 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.080
 feature is it 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.330
 versatility besides connecting 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.000
 all kinds of external hard drives 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.489
 monitors can be charged on it 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.950
 the device there is implemented compatibility with 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.390
 standard usb power delivery 20 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 with power up to 100 watts 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.950
 only units start to let out 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.320
 products supporting the new standard 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.019
 An example of sandisk early March showed 1 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.989
 usb flash drive providing connector 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.570
 usb type-c that is on one side taip 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.090
 si to another regular yuzbi 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.340
 10 the number of authorities showed 1 external drive 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.890
 with type-c support and finally 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.950
 mc and introduced its first maternal 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.630
 fee- syp fee before joining his support 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.460
 in various devices accounted for 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.620
 manage with special adapters 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.740
 for example you will need to spend almost 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.640
 $ 80 for reverse connector u s 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:05.220
 Bessie with hdmi input and esbe 30 and port 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.790
 supply the same cost see 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.790
 adapter 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.820
 an adapter that turns and beaten 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.850
 psy in the usual port of yuesbi 30 will cost 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.190
 19 dollars this you guessed it 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.320
 were valuable is full online stor 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.320
 but over time there will be analogues that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.450
 will be much cheaper due to such 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.370
 the topic is to organize its discussion in 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.230
 comments under this video like you 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.100
 standard among various users
