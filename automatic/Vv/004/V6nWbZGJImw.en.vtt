now some parts of the Everglades have

a<00:02:16.730> river<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> scientists<00:02:18.680> use<00:02:18.710> an<00:02:19.070> instrument

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
a river so scientists use an instrument

the lead researcher predicted it would

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.250 
the lead researcher predicted it would
take<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.460> dye<00:02:37.640> an<00:02:37.970> hour<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> half<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.990> cross

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
take the dye an hour and a half to cross

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650 
take the dye an hour and a half to cross
the<00:02:39.470> finish<00:02:39.590> line<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.640> took<00:02:40.910> ten<00:02:41.270> minutes

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
the finish line it took ten minutes

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.840 
the finish line it took ten minutes
that's<00:02:42.380> why<00:02:42.620> we're<00:02:42.800> running<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> experiment

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
that's why we're running the experiment

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.050 
that's why we're running the experiment
