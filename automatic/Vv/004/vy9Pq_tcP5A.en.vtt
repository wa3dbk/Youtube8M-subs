00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.410
 Driver setup position is a little bit the iron force posture that you 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:33.899

 team ah 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.780
 Normally when you take a shot of the iron, it is usually three and we usually position it on the ball 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.740

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.960
 The position a little right of doeneundeyo c should be such a position 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:12.970
 It was also when we watched the iron yesterday , 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:17.770
 Because the position is exactly in the middle of the body and you are a person, 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:22.900
 The position of the shoulders is not so different from the position of the right and left shoulders 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:27.100
 The medicine is on the right shoulder because the left hand is on top and the ridge is below 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.550
 So, of course, I do not know that. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.630
 This is well protected by what the cucumber generally does 2 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.150
 When using the Japanese are, we should be depending a lot more jjokkeum 5 day length shoulder

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 Okay, put on the head. 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:02.380
 Now, in this situation, most people think of the left two times 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:07.120
 Ah Young mother hasyeoseo usually think that more weight should be given to the right of the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.410
 Some things back at 60 are so extreme right at 30 to 30 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.030
 I'm more the creek newspaper that I'm wrong grunge look 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 3 What is the best way to the outermost position on each 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.870
 Look at the central part of the body so that you can resist it. 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.019
 Let's have a book like this in the center of the resistance . 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.650
 Please lightly squeeze both hands like this 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.790
 You take a third position in a small fish tank . 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.330
 Right shoulder tilts right to the right Turn driver to the right 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:46.030

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:51.370
 So when hair turned the face of the club head peach minute mark on me left leg 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.730

 It happens at the moment you touch the peach table 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.160
 Left and right angle of the industry that angle is yours, 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.590
 It is becoming attitude 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.250
 When this happens, it is natural that you can naturally make 5 sides of the system possible 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.000
 That's it. 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.900
 If you are thinking about playing with cheese 5 times extremely, 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.269
