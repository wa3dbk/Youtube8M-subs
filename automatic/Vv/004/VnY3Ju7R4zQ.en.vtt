pretty<00:00:29.550> much<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.880> back<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> exact<00:00:30.960> same

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pretty much get back into the exact same

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
pretty much get back into the exact same
place<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.219> maybe<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:32.910> hour<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
place I was and maybe like an hour and a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
place I was and maybe like an hour and a
half<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
half now that I know how to do the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
half now that I know how to do the
storyline<00:00:35.309> stuff<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.719> won't<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
storyline stuff so that won't be a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080 
storyline stuff so that won't be a
problem<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.800> I'll<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.579> finding<00:00:38.790> different

apocalypse it just kind of it tips off

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.940 
apocalypse it just kind of it tips off
the<00:02:21.720> game<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.170> puts<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.890> those

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the game and puts it in one of those

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.950 
the game and puts it in one of those
directions<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.700> makes<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.660> this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
much better than some other games just

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
much better than some other games just
because<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.210> not<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.570> simple<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.590> know

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
