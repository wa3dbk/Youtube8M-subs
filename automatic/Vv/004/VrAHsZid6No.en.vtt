00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 a minute an update tip of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 samsung galaxy s 3 update 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.880
 android 4.1.2 nÃ© 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.860
 an update of the 5 mega center there 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 but some interesting things came in. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.810
 the first one is the multi window now 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.270
 you can use two applications at the same 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 Let's open time for you to see this. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.240
 will be very good tablet xoom tablet with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.090
 10 inches out there you'll be able to use 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.309
 so two apps do not get much 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 good is also typing something and in 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 another there looking a website 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.250
 maybe then it's much more practical 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 not so much up here down turn 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.450
 the looking device is next to it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.200
 from the other 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.180
 so I 'm not all apps that 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 still have it or can be used 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 well but over time bp will come in. 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.450
 arts that also entered this program 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.020
 Look how nice you can. 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.540
 is not a photo editor you already 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.730
 you can take a picture and choose the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.950
 image you can do after 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.950
 also very good interesting is cool 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.260
 It was ball show that several you can 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.400
 see in the picture if you can swap and frames 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.990
 and so on 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.320
 the display warned him 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.050
 here in the notifications panel you 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.790
 now you can have that little shine 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.660
 take or you click here she comes back 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.700
