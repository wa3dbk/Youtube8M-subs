00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.090
 behind 

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hi, I'm beats and I'm going to present you 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.109
 anime review since they are always 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240
 asking you to recommend animes and 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.339
 well I know that sometimes I looked for 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.679
 some side for the other but good I decided 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.500
 what is more convenient to do the reviews 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.449
 on video now let's talk about single 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.640
 kino that today and this year I'm so 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.230
 popular these days and that surely 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.699
 some of you have already seen but 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 for those who do not, I'm going to explain 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.919
 what it is about and see if it is a father or not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.100
 chinguen kilo who is a food made 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.770
 Jaime and it's called good to made the manga and 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.110
 at first he introduced it to the people 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.600
 of Sweden to be published in their 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.420
 weekly magazine and they told him it was 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.980
 as very young and as good as not 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.770
 He was so young and they wanted happiness 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 more youthful for he liked its 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.079
 readers 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.070
 then he has to change so many 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.629
 things that he said no and better he left 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.969
 with those of codensa and he introduced them to 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.590
 them that they liked and good already 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.780
 made a success the michael after 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.479
 they did in the anime 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.580
 now the important thing that treats good 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.680
 Well, that's a manga, as I was saying 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.840
 that are published with anxiety then 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.280
 good session time the is directed to 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.650
 the male sector as of 15 years in 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.119
 go ahead but for everyone we like 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.320
 it does not matter that we are not 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.780
 men and good of what it treats therefore 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.030
 assumes that 100 years ago humanity 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 was attacked by some big monsters 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.680
 that are known as titans then 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.030
 like humans who walk in squares 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.430
 of a stupid smile that they do so 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.670
 and what they do is they eat the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.540
 people like me I eat 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.130
 then they are happy and they swallow people and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 then how were many days very 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.619
 large and measure between 3 to 15 meters 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.590
 height then humanity began to 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.350
 be devastated and that's why they had to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.909
 take refuge in a city and if in a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.250
 city ​​that has three circles 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.189
 concentric that are three barriers each 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 one of these has a name rosen maria 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.170
 and I do not remember the other one but the point is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.840
 that humanity lived like that for a hundred 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 years and nobody knows it attacked until 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.739
 obvious we get to where it is in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.600
 history and we find a 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.450
 child although it is called eren who lives with 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.239
 his mom with his dad and with a sister 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.980
 adoptive axxion in my house then 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.690
 well obviously you now in that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.840
 Something is going to happen 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.980
 an enormous titan of more than 50 meters of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 height that pierces the city's best 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.819
 one of the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.590
 most external cities and then the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.840
 pierce with the knee and begin to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.959
 enter the little titans 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.459
 small ones that come 3 to 15 meters and 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.290
 then it begins to be a chaos in 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.000
 the city ​​and good happened was something that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.670
 you can not fight them all this happens in 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.580
 chapter 1 the point is that they are with 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.750
 my house and with another friend of yours who 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.390
 call someone who is like more 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.849
 intellectual they decide they want to finish 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 with these titans and then they join 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.170
 a special team a special force 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.629
 that attack the titans as well as with 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.849
 some ties they hang as with 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.620
 some ties and so they jump and they hit 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.049
 the titans and you will see what is 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.690
 its weak point redouble but the father of 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.359
 these of this series is that it is 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.690
 quite board not quite but it 's something 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.000
 dor 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.160
 and then the titans are half 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.840
 you are all that as I take them 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.459
 humans in squares and they are pretty 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.739
 violent, all they do is eat and 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.830
 eat then if we see enough action 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.050
 the story is more or less good 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.700
 the interesting is going through the chapters 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.630
 pretty fast that is not all are 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.580
 so linear there are jumps in time and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.650
 then we are seeing the evolution of 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.260
 humans and how are they attacking these 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.989
 titans 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.670
 Well, it's pretty good because it's not 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.159
 is that they see them so easy and now they do not 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.470
 are you seeing then if it gives you a little 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.140
 as of despair so far 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.659
 18 chapters have gone that the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.720
 can you see they will be in total 25 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.510
 the more one goes and the better the best is 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.860
 first season after you're in another 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.900
 the series as it begins to move forward as 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.370
 better some people say they 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.590
 despair of a little of the character 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.820
 but what I do tell you is that 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.680
 the first chapters are very 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.000
 exciting and you can see them and 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.570
 then they judge whether they want to continue 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 seeing more or not if they like the gori that 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.710
 see the blood and how the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.990
 people are father if they like the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.210
 action is also father fighting 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.190
 are more or less characters 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.800
 so interesting manuel in that classic 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.690
 main character that I think can 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.669
 with everyone and he was going to attack and going to 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.590
 save humanity and have a 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.570
 very interesting feature for the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.180
 which then goes on making layers 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.610
 better to realize your goal but 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.289
 you and to the truth my house is a 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.710
 girl of this 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.559
 colloquial and bridge that is like that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.249
 very rude and very good and is an expert and 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:05.279
 then practically nothing 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.679
 nothing hurts him but he has a past 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:10.319
 interesting and good and armin is another 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:11.999
 güerito boy who is more intellectual than 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.459
 of better is not so good physically 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.289
 but he is also friends with them and has 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.719
 good ideas and good strategies for 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.009
 go forward then good is a 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.619
 destination that today you can find it 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.419
 very easy on any side also it 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:29.129
 they are making four games that the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.379
 It makes production there and good they will come out 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.759
 by September of December of this year 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.079
 and also you are planning a live 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.360
 action I do not know why the Japanese 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.889
 always making evasion of all and what 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.529
 that make chingón is the anime not 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.689
 necessarily the movies but good 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.849
 but they are exploiting the series and 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.679
 so then if you want to see zinc equine 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.559
 what or jeans and I recommend him I'm 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:52.829

 everything I say goodbye and coming soon 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:56.360
 would present them another capsule from another 

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:59.070
 anime 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.330

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:07.100
