00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the what's called the water cooling part

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.520 
the what's called the water cooling part
next<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.380> cool

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.190 

and<00:01:36.830> then<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.730> this<00:01:38.030> other<00:01:38.330> path<00:01:38.630> leading

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and then on this other path leading

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then on this other path leading
here's<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:40.190> wood<00:01:40.370> chopping<00:01:40.610> block

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.440 
here's that little wood chopping block
this<00:01:43.040> other<00:01:43.280> path<00:01:43.520> kind<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.030> goes<00:01:44.150> up<00:01:44.180> to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
this other path kind of goes up to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.060 
this other path kind of goes up to
another<00:01:44.600> kind<00:01:44.870> of<00:01:44.990> resting<00:01:45.710> area<00:01:45.950> with
