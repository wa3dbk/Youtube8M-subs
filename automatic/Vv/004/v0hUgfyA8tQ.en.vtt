00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.770
 alright so today I find myself 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.930
 with my unicorn hair for you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.760
 talk about hair makeup and more 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 precisely to talk to you about the tunes 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.580
 schalk then the yesterday chalk what is it 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.280
 that these are simply 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 pastels for hair pigments that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 will you color your hair for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.520
 few days a few weeks 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.859
 eventually this is a trend that has 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 published in about 2012 and that me 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.220
 personally I find it super fun to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.570
 to put colors in the hair 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.400
 so it's not going well everyone 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 obviously but nothing prevents 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 raving once in a while with 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.350
 his hair because in the end it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.790
 will push back to get you each 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.290
 in fact it's super simple because it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.760
 are more and more brands that in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 do for example you can find some 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 at l'orÃ©al in the form of colorful creams 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 and in fact that these creams there are going to last 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.700
 much longer than the airs 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 traditional schalk that means there 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 you will end up with the effect 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.489
 colored for six to eight shampoo so 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 think carefully before doing it 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.500
 personally I am a bit frustrated 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 I do not intend to stay several months with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.039
 this color there in the hair I 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.510
 prefers to do something that will last 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.850
 the time of a weekend the time of a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.380
 evening and that will fade in one to two 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
 shampoos so you have some 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.619
 research at kiko in single dose form 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 therefore only one color per articles 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.280
 sold and me what I found they 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 were much more advantageous 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 find it on the website royal extension 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.780
 I found a kit where there are all these 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.110
 colors there and I paid about 25 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.630
 euros so I find that for the price 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 income to a pastel is much more 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.780
 advantageous little warning in this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.729
 regarding the use of the airs 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.210
 schalk so especially the one that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.520
 I use 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 I think it's really 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 not recommended for people who basic 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.049
 really hair that is already dry 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.729
 brittle and damaged because sabine 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 hair so it's not something that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.479
 you will do every week 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.490
 it's really for delirium 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.320
 once in the month once every 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.790
 two months here to have a little bit 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380
 of color in the hair but this 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.990
 is not something that needs to be 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 use to replace a stain 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 professional for example if you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
 want permanent colors in them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.290
 hair rather go to a colorist 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.209
 professionals who will use 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.789
 products much more suitable and for 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.989
 girls 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.640
 healthy hair earlier like me I 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 really advise you really 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 make a mask very nourishing and 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.459
 repairers before using his is 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.569
 also one after a time you 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.670
 could have the color in your hair 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.920
 because anyway he'll have to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.569
 to mitigate the effects a little to these songs 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 products to limit the damage and 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.780
 drying out before using that I 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.090
 advise you to apply in your 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.340
 hair a cream you know type cream 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.500
 of day that we put without rinsing 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.790
 an hour before doing it like that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.859
 you will already have basic and I do well 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.629
 hydrated however avoid oils 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.980
 because suddenly the pigments they go 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.900
 slide on the oil and they will not go 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.069
 hold long hair veils and they 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.720
 may leave much more 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.099
 easily on the clothes of the coup I 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.439
 will you do the demo of comanche apic 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.340
 serves chocolate especially so I 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.540
 advise you to put yourself in your 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.829
 bathroom like that you'll have a 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.659
 source of water nearby 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.930
 and think about providing a towel for 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.299
 wipe your hands and a T-shirt 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.829
 black preferably wall a tshirt that 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.500
 you are not afraid of tasks and so 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.180
 Let's go 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.770
 I will make a gradient of 3 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.000
 colors so I start by choosing 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.410
 the pastels I need 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940
 then I take the time to many 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.670
 mails and comb my hair before 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.990
 to fade my rondot hair I you 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.430
 advises to work on small 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.950
 wicks in order to get a prettier 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.959
 result start with wet well the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.700
 match you want colorful come 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.680
 then rubbed the pastel up and down 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.390
 to take the game as little as possible 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.440
 applied the past until 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.920
 the intensity of the color you 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.750
 suitable 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.690
 then came and rubbed that color so 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.310
 to melt it in your hair for 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.170
 to realize the degrade it is enough then 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.390
 to do exactly the same manipulation 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.440
 on the step of the wick and then become 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.580
 melt both colors to joys and 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.580
 the same for the third color 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.700
 Delicately untangle your locks to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.870
 using a comb could use a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.590
 hair dryer maybe take the step 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.590
 to dry them 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.010
 and so not there the result you see 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.810
 I think it's so fun it's colorful 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.400
 that's funny it changes from 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.410
 daily really for an evening I 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.930
 find that there are some who will be surprised 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.370
 to see me arrive like that maybe 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.690
 that you will not necessarily like 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.460
 colors that I used but good 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.820
 after that it's my hair it's not the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.680
 yours 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.000
 I like it that's the important thing if 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.380
 you never turn to this 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.390
 pallet has it besides I will put you 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.330
 montbard link info if you are 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.250
 interested in buying it frankly he 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.690
 are full full of combinations that 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.420
 are possible with that you can do 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.640
 something very discreet that's so 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.320
 you have trouble assuming the colors 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.640
 to the signs you can totally 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.010
 farted a cable and do something 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.870
 hyper extravagant not nice with this guy 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.670
 here is makeup for hair is 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.350
 we can do the same hairstyle we 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.270
 usually makes kind of distress 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.530
 buns but that's right now 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.300
 give them a little something in 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.510
 the more we for example you can you 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.550
 do braid on the side that have been 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.130
 previously colored and it will make you 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.110
 a kind of fake headband me coward me 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.090
 show what that gives my locks of 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.040
 color once drawn and I find 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.020
 that the gradient is even more pronounced 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.340
 it's really nice I also 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.780
 took pictures of my tied hair 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.460
 in a ponytail to show you what 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.110
 that it gave a little and frankly I 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.790
 am very pleasantly surprised by this 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.500
 little side to the rock that stands out me 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.580
 personally I love so I do 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.480
 big kisses and I tell you to very 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.480
 soon for a new video
