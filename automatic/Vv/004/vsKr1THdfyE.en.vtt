 you how to pass through the wall in minecraft 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.910
 that is, we see before us a wall of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.769
 hip which we can not break 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 you can go through it and either 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.980
 any subject there I zaprivachena 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.710
 areas and so on this is a bug right away 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 they say that this bug found alanya 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 but some American can't remember for 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
 we need this let's start 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440
 let's get down to this we need one 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.410
 rail that is, I put for example here 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 one prog thread and a couple of blocks that is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 we like incident sit down click shift 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.449
 he slazit tray 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.690
 very far from the trolley we need us 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.989
 ask to code to encode this area 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.369
 exactly three blocks from the trolley that is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.770
 magnet to here are three blocks here are three blocks and 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.289
 so until the end it's all this way 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.390
 Now, but I climbed magnetically click 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:21.909
 shift and we appear inside this cord 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.630
 chest like ours here all sorts of treasures 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.969
 exit is easy, too, but put in a corner 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.219
 exactly chose this where he would go 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.939
 exactly if we put here this here 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.789
 trolley 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.469
 there we will come out about like this 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.689
 there is as we saw at the beginning of the video i 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.880
 for some reason could not sit down trolley he yes 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.310
 ok now i have rearranged there again 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.849
 can we sit here we sat down and click on 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.649
 6 minutes and we are no 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.770
 block plans are not used here then 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.840
 she has teleporting naturally 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 that here this here is used kitchenware 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 blocks for 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.929
 so to say giving out items will come for 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.849
 simplicity oh well for example 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.679
 the trolley stands as we first video 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.110
 do you see that we are somewhere out there 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.880
 We are in theory if there is so 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.329
 it turns out we will be inside 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.099
 let's get started on shift and we 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.290
 we see that we came with this 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.680
 parties also we go out 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.750
 here and all we have it all works we 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.270
 can pass through walls 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.950
 so that's all I wanted to show you and 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.360
