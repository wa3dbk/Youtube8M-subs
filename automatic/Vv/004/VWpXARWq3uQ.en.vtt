 I'm here to launch and submit to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 You guys are very proud in 2015 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 using the architecture project with 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:42.540
 blogs people leave you in my 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:49.920
 experience I worked and after 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:54.090
 2007 without advancing without updating I got 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 very very long time and resources as well 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 that I never imagined because I stayed 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 delighted with harry offices in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:44.189
 Brazil or the automatic use of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.259
 also be able to generate 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:02:03.000
 building materials for example can 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 make your lighting points 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 design the client and I find out 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 I started studying the subject 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.620
 available on the internet and courses but 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.750
 Luciana's book that helped me a lot 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.360
 but there was still an application 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.180
 practice whole architecture projects 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 free in the course I bought the tutorial 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:43.090
 that he heard was always aimed solely 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:03:15.669
 I decided to find nothing else 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:03:53.049
 same in the internet nor the basic its form 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:55.739
 to optimize your boss and then enjoy 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.739
