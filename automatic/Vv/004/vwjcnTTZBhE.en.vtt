00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
that let's get onto this Sanchez here I

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
that let's get onto this Sanchez here I
don't<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> matters<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
don't think it matters if you get on to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
don't think it matters if you get on to
it<00:01:17.010> after<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> cutscene<00:01:18.120> but<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.659> always

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it after the cutscene but I would always

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
it after the cutscene but I would always
just<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> before<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> cutscene

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just get on to it before the cutscene

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
just get on to it before the cutscene
because<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.120> guarantees<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> work<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
because it guarantees to work so as you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.270 
because it guarantees to work so as you
can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.150> snitch<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.720> getting<00:01:27.930> away

you<00:02:10.710> don't<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.039> anything<00:02:12.950> yeah<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.130> there's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
you don't do anything yeah so there's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.680 
you don't do anything yeah so there's
gonna<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> little<00:02:14.940> bit<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.210> wait<00:02:15.390> because

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
gonna be a little bit of a wait because

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.300 
gonna be a little bit of a wait because
he<00:02:15.780> doesn't<00:02:16.080> drive<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.500> fast<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
he doesn't drive very fast and this is a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.250 
he doesn't drive very fast and this is a
big<00:02:17.520> mountain<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:18.930> bit

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
big mountain so it can be a little bit

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.880 
big mountain so it can be a little bit
annoying<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.160> part<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:21.380> mean<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.590> honest

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
annoying this part I mean to be honest

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.710 
annoying this part I mean to be honest
this<00:02:23.040> Sanchez<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:23.850> much<00:02:24.060> better<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.540> get

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this Sanchez is not much better to get

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.180 
this Sanchez is not much better to get
than<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> other<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.380> because<00:02:25.740> even<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.100> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
than the other one because even if you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.860 
than the other one because even if you
get<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.550> other<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.790> earlier<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> game

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
get the other one earlier in the game

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
get the other one earlier in the game
you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.110> still<00:02:28.500> use<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.100> dirty<00:02:29.310> safehouse

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you can still use the dirty safehouse

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.590 
you can still use the dirty safehouse
garage<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> beginning<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.440> game<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
garage from the beginning of the game so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.210 
garage from the beginning of the game so
it<00:02:33.600> really<00:02:33.870> doesn't<00:02:34.110> matter<00:02:34.320> which<00:02:34.710> Sanchez

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
it really doesn't matter which Sanchez

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.360 
it really doesn't matter which Sanchez
you<00:02:35.370> guess<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> end<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> day

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
you guess at the end of the day

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.920 
you guess at the end of the day
they're<00:02:36.580> both<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.819> as<00:02:37.209> valuable<00:02:37.569> as<00:02:37.780> each

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
they're both just as valuable as each

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.979 
they're both just as valuable as each
other<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.970> at<00:02:40.060> least<00:02:40.239> it's<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.540> very<00:02:40.720> flexible

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
other but at least it's a very flexible

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.320 
other but at least it's a very flexible
decision<00:02:44.400> anyway<00:02:45.400> we're<00:02:45.700> coming<00:02:46.000> up<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.300> that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
decision anyway we're coming up to that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.270 
decision anyway we're coming up to that
really<00:02:46.870> sharp<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.440> right<00:02:47.739> now<00:02:47.920> as<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.250> can

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
really sharp then right now as you can

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.059 
really sharp then right now as you can
see<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.110> shark<00:02:50.319> then<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.590> was<00:02:50.890> talking

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
see this is the shark then I was talking

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.300 
see this is the shark then I was talking
about<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.870> some<00:02:53.110> point<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.799> road<00:02:54.040> we

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
about so at some point on this road we

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.920 
about so at some point on this road we
are<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.610> go<00:02:54.730> towards<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> beach<00:02:55.569> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
are going to go towards the beach and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.170 
are going to go towards the beach and
this<00:02:56.650> car<00:02:56.920> will<00:02:57.129> be<00:02:57.160> driving<00:02:57.519> completely<00:02:58.120> in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
this car will be driving completely in

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.150 
this car will be driving completely in
the<00:02:58.299> opposite<00:02:58.569> direction<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.010> very

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the opposite direction but it's very

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.490 
the opposite direction but it's very
easy<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.580> time<00:03:00.879> this<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.299> don't<00:03:01.480> worry<00:03:01.629> you

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
easy to time this so don't worry you

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.860 
easy to time this so don't worry you
have<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.799> go<00:03:02.920> very<00:03:03.190> far<00:03:03.310> away<00:03:03.670> from<00:03:04.120> him<00:03:04.360> for

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
have to go very far away from him for

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.300 
have to go very far away from him for
the<00:03:04.930> mission<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.379> fail<00:03:05.560> anyway<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.099> you're

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the mission to fail anyway so you're

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.710 
the mission to fail anyway so you're
given<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.640> lot<00:03:06.819> of<00:03:06.940> time<00:03:07.120> for<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> happen

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
given a lot of time for this to happen

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.410 
given a lot of time for this to happen
so<00:03:08.310> when<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.819> sort<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.209> place

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
so when you get to this sort of place

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.990 
so when you get to this sort of place
right<00:03:10.690> now<00:03:11.019> I'd<00:03:11.530> start<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.099> accelerate<00:03:12.430> and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
right now I'd start to accelerate and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150 
right now I'd start to accelerate and
pretty<00:03:13.720> quickly<00:03:13.959> get<00:03:14.319> yourself<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> beach

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
pretty quickly get yourself to the beach

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550 
pretty quickly get yourself to the beach
I<00:03:15.599> take<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.750> easy<00:03:16.900> because<00:03:17.079> I<00:03:17.230> don't<00:03:17.380> want<00:03:17.500> to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
I take it easy because I don't want to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.140 
I take it easy because I don't want to
crash<00:03:17.769> into<00:03:18.010> any<00:03:18.220> trees<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.060> be

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
crash into any trees because to be

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.940 
crash into any trees because to be
honest<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:19.360> takes<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.900> lot<00:03:20.049> longer<00:03:20.260> than<00:03:20.739> just

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
honest that takes a lot longer than just

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.059 
honest that takes a lot longer than just
going<00:03:21.129> quite<00:03:21.640> quickly<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:23.470> go<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.829> this

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
going quite quickly so just go to this

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.550 
going quite quickly so just go to this
beach<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:25.629> can<00:03:25.780> see<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.290> Cove

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
beach here and you can see this to Cove

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.160 
beach here and you can see this to Cove
here<00:03:26.890> just<00:03:27.519> gradually<00:03:28.090> drive<00:03:28.480> your<00:03:28.690> bike<00:03:28.900> into

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
here just gradually drive your bike into

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.699 
here just gradually drive your bike into
the<00:03:29.290> water

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the water

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.660 
the water
make<00:03:30.340> sure<00:03:30.579> it's<00:03:30.790> submerged<00:03:31.450> enough<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.670> don't

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
make sure it's submerged enough I don't

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.699 
make sure it's submerged enough I don't
think<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.299> deep<00:03:34.569> was<00:03:34.840> necessary<00:03:35.470> but<00:03:35.650> it

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
think that deep was necessary but it

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.800 
think that deep was necessary but it
needs<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.129> quite<00:03:36.370> deep<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.329> save<00:03:37.599> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
needs to be quite deep to save the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.349 
needs to be quite deep to save the
properties<00:03:38.230> anyway<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.090> pretty<00:03:40.299> much

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
properties anyway so you pretty much

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.729 
properties anyway so you pretty much
just<00:03:40.720> wait<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.139> mission<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.530> fail

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
just wait for the mission to fail

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.979 
just wait for the mission to fail
because<00:03:42.489> he's<00:03:42.609> driving<00:03:42.970> away<00:03:43.060> from<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
because he's driving away from you and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.300 
because he's driving away from you and
there<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.410> mission<00:03:47.889> failed

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
there you go mission failed

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.160 
there you go mission failed
now<00:03:48.519> just<00:03:48.790> get<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> Sanchez<00:03:49.510> back<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.019> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
now just get the Sanchez back out of the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.289 
now just get the Sanchez back out of the
water<00:03:50.410> by<00:03:50.920> getting<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.700> or<00:03:51.819> pushing<00:03:52.060> it

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
water by getting on it or pushing it
