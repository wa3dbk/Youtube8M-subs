00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 weeks wild hunter oh shit i 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 Africa will stand me enough 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.279
 top up every time someone peaks 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.320
 this boat 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 ass not give a shit your shit copy 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 your fail your traps these ridicule 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 ability to survive all the time and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 passive in the spirit if not given yours 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.180
 the team she take on sucks in someone else's 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.010
 the team she just tears everyone ok 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.539
 passive is called stealing from which 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 she gets a fifteen percent 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 speeding up the passage case through the bushes 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 that he reminds us of the first rule 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.629
 moved florence always blame your 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.530
 environment rule number two never 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.530
 run for no lady 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.000
 Kiev skill is a cast like me here 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.860
 this is my peanut 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.689
 ass I hate him 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.909
 in fact, it's just a skill that says 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.890
 always went in and i'm not afraid of rigs and what 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.200
 later you understand the spear the more 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.240
 the damage you end up with is actually yours 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.930
 the task is finishing off as much as possible 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.220
 more battered enemies a times 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 so what the fuck can also cause 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.130
 a spear between the breasts our tower is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.170
 a trap that is simple and 4 minutes she 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.119
 briefly gives visibility when installing 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.710
 or if someone has run into besides 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.390
 causing great damage to her 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.100
 use as a mini ward for 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.050
 highlighting the target so that one would 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.970
 finish with a cake or scatter them to 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.830
 teamfights for advantage 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.229
 future call of the ancestors is our cup 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.330
 allowing to treat any ally as well 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.700
 accelerates attack speed you just treat 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.740
 any team mate with low efficiency continue 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.420
 throwing spears she like semi boots 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.549
 which is held by give away is hurled 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.409
 sticks and smeared feces just 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.539
 to have your whole team with that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.610
 you can't get a puma form in Denmark and 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.800
 ultimate skill that allows her to be 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.750
 so tenacious and mobile in general all its 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.729
 skill gives way do not spend mana in this 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.800
 form and now our cap which was 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.780
 throw spear is replaced by finishing at 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.450
 which the next attack will inflict bonus 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.760
 damage plus a percentage of missing hp so 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.769
 that on reaching 6 stay away from 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720
 this creature of you have a little hepe otherwise she 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.910
 just bite you half ass flash drive 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.630
 gives way to a jump who could 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.310
 to think 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.200
 can be used to run away like 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.760
 curs or even to overcome small 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.760
 walls and barriers 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.310
 Yashka becomes a sweep allowing 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.109
 attack multiple enemies and deals 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.579
 I can rum principle all you need after 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.849
 appeals this catch up with anyone 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.799
 scratch your face and finish with a crown home 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.170
 the task of playing for not letting it be yet 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.599
 a bigger bitch than a forty year old scepter 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.579
 keep back and then to the essay with the top 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.799
 sorry i mean provide 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.569
 exact killing a cat with your spear and 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.480
 also using mind to catch up and 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.980
 leaving opponents after reaching 6 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.989
 can you decide whether you will rob 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.180
 opponent on the line or go gank 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.280
 the second is given very simply because the map 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.769
 just covered with bushes especially for 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.379
 you go out to the bot throwing a spear ecu 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.859
