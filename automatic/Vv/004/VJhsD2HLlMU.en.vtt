fingers<00:01:58.009> we've<00:01:58.700> got<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.569> finger<00:01:59.990> bridge<00:02:00.229> in

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
fingers we've got the finger bridge in

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.239 
fingers we've got the finger bridge in
between<00:02:02.659> all<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.960> fingers<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:04.219> have

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
between all the fingers we have

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.309 
between all the fingers we have

you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.180> knuckle

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
you can see here in the knuckle

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.320 
you can see here in the knuckle
we're<00:02:18.860> using<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> tunnel<00:02:19.550> system<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.300> I

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
we're using the tunnel system when I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.720 
we're using the tunnel system when I
roll<00:02:21.050> my<00:02:21.080> fingers<00:02:21.770> around<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.190> bars<00:02:22.400> make<00:02:22.700> a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
roll my fingers around the bars make a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120 
roll my fingers around the bars make a
fist<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.810> see<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> tunnel<00:02:24.290> expand<00:02:24.920> so

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
fist you can see the tunnel expand so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.400 
fist you can see the tunnel expand so
it's<00:02:25.280> not<00:02:25.459> pulling<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.090> glove<00:02:26.330> we've<00:02:27.230> got

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's not pulling on the glove we've got

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.010 
it's not pulling on the glove we've got

slider in the palm reduces the chance of
the<00:03:53.120> grab<00:03:53.420> because<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> plastic<00:03:54.320> slides<00:03:54.590> a

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the grab because the plastic slides a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.100 
the grab because the plastic slides a
lot<00:03:54.980> easier<00:03:55.430> than<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.700> leather<00:03:55.940> would<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.930> can

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
