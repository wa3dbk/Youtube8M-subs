yeah<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.609> sure<00:00:21.480> did<00:00:21.810> luck<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.220> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
yeah I sure did luck out when I got this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
yeah I sure did luck out when I got this
bad<00:00:23.730> boy<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.470> didn't<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> would

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
bad boy I didn't think that it would

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.359 
bad boy I didn't think that it would
work<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.269> works<00:00:27.539> perfectly<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
work but it works perfectly and this is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.389 
work but it works perfectly and this is
probably<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.539> more<00:00:30.900> amazing<00:00:31.470> finds<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
probably one of my more amazing finds so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
probably one of my more amazing finds so
let's<00:00:32.669> talk<00:00:32.969> about<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.420> controller<00:00:33.809> before

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
let's talk about the controller before

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.190 
let's talk about the controller before
we<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:35.040> ahead<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.640> test<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.210> display<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
we go ahead and test and display it this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
we go ahead and test and display it this
controller<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> options<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.850> L<00:00:39.390> r<00:00:40.190> RB<00:00:41.450> lb

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
things like that it has the typical

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.510 
things like that it has the typical

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that's really really flimsy this is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's really really flimsy this is
probably<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> worst<00:00:59.550> d<00:00:59.789> pads<00:01:00.030> I've

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
probably one of the worst d pads I've

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.750 
probably one of the worst d pads I've
ever<00:01:00.449> seen<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:00.960> life<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.829> very

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
ever seen in my life it's very very

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.470 
ever seen in my life it's very very
flimsy

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
flimsy

I<00:01:03.629> mean<00:01:03.960> maybe<00:01:04.170> people<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.309> feel

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I mean maybe people like it I just feel

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
I mean maybe people like it I just feel
like<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.299> rip<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> feels

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like I'm gonna rip it off and it feels

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950 
like I'm gonna rip it off and it feels
very<00:01:07.860> cheap<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.970> placed<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.689> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
very cheap and just placed on there as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200 
very cheap and just placed on there as
an<00:01:10.110> afterthought<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.430> thumb<00:01:11.729> sticks<00:01:12.000> are

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
an afterthought the two thumb sticks are

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
an afterthought the two thumb sticks are
very<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:12.900> well<00:01:13.140> done<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> contrast<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
very very well done and contrast and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
very very well done and contrast and
that's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> important<00:01:15.299> part<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.720> yeah<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that's the important part right yeah so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
that's the important part right yeah so
the<00:01:17.729> thumb<00:01:18.090> sticks<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.509> nice<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:19.049> click<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the thumb sticks are nice they click in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
the thumb sticks are nice they click in
with<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> very<00:01:20.009> satisfying<00:01:20.820> ly<00:01:21.090> loud<00:01:21.330> click<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
with a very satisfying ly loud click and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.370 
with a very satisfying ly loud click and
they<00:01:22.619> move<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.380> feel

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
they move around very well they feel

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
they move around very well they feel
good<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> top<00:01:26.070> they're<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.520> rubberized<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
good on top they're very rubberized and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.789 
good on top they're very rubberized and
it<00:01:27.570> doesn't<00:01:27.869> feel<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.320> fingers<00:01:28.680> are

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it doesn't feel like my fingers are

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
it doesn't feel like my fingers are
gonna<00:01:28.890> fall<00:01:29.189> off<00:01:29.369> although<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.509> have

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
gonna fall off although I would have

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319 
gonna fall off although I would have
preferred<00:01:30.979> concave<00:01:31.979> thumb<00:01:32.640> sticks<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
preferred concave thumb sticks because I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.319 
preferred concave thumb sticks because I
do<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:34.110> rubberized<00:01:35.009> tops<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
do not like rubberized tops but this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
do not like rubberized tops but this
works<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.950> hands<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
works for what it is in my hands this is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
works for what it is in my hands this is
probably<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> most<00:01:40.470> comfortable

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
probably one of the most comfortable

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.870 
probably one of the most comfortable
controllers<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.270> felt<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> long<00:01:42.869> time

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
controllers I have felt in a long time

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
controllers I have felt in a long time
comparatively<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.329> feels<00:01:46.049> more<00:01:46.439> comfortable

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
comparatively it feels more comfortable

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.420 
comparatively it feels more comfortable
than<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:48.060> Xbox<00:01:48.540> 360<00:01:48.810> controller<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.009> thumbs<00:01:50.220> up

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
than an Xbox 360 controller so thumbs up

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490 
than an Xbox 360 controller so thumbs up
on<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.420> side<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
on that on the back side you can see a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.060 
on that on the back side you can see a
giant<00:01:53.070> mesh<00:01:53.549> cover<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.290> assumably

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
giant mesh cover for what is assumably

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850 
giant mesh cover for what is assumably
the<00:01:56.729> fan<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.409> couple

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the fan and you can see a couple

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310 
the fan and you can see a couple
openings<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.790> allow<00:02:00.030> ventilation<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
openings to allow ventilation for this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
openings to allow ventilation for this
so<00:02:01.619> why<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.219> controller<00:02:02.670> called<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so why is this controller called the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660 
so why is this controller called the
chill<00:02:03.540> stream<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> why<00:02:04.710> didn't<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> mention

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
chill stream and why didn't I mention

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
chill stream and why didn't I mention
this<00:02:05.790> button<00:02:06.149> well<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.600> button<00:02:06.990> controls

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this button well this button controls

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
this button well this button controls
off<00:02:07.740> low<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.459> high<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.179> allows<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> turn

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
off low and high and allows you to turn

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.780 
off low and high and allows you to turn
your<00:02:10.830> chill<00:02:11.099> stream<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.970> off

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
your chill stream on or off

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
your chill stream on or off
yes<00:02:13.060> believe<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.629> or<00:02:13.840> not<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.349> controller

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
yes believe it or not this controller

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.209 
yes believe it or not this controller
also<00:02:15.250> works<00:02:15.939> on<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.689> PC<00:02:17.079> on<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.590> bottom<00:02:18.040> now

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
also works on the PC on the bottom now

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.849 
also works on the PC on the bottom now
there's<00:02:18.640> something<00:02:18.969> blocking<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.989> port<00:02:20.590> to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
there's something blocking the port to

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.709 
there's something blocking the port to
allow<00:02:21.189> you<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.609> put<00:02:21.790> your<00:02:21.879> headphone<00:02:22.269> jack<00:02:22.299> in

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
allow you to put your headphone jack in

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.690 
allow you to put your headphone jack in
so<00:02:23.170> I'm<00:02:23.290> not<00:02:23.469> entirely<00:02:23.769> sure<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.219> this<00:02:24.370> even

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so I'm not entirely sure if this even

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.000 
so I'm not entirely sure if this even
does<00:02:24.939> support<00:02:25.329> headphone<00:02:25.810> jacks<00:02:26.109> or<00:02:26.349> not<00:02:26.590> due

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
does support headphone jacks or not due

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.949 
does support headphone jacks or not due
to<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.280> fact<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.819> probably<00:02:28.090> takes<00:02:28.540> up<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
to the fact that it probably takes up a

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.920 
to the fact that it probably takes up a
little<00:02:29.470> extra<00:02:29.859> power<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.549> other<00:02:30.930> unfortunate

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
little extra power the other unfortunate

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.319 
little extra power the other unfortunate
part<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> wired<00:02:33.579> connection

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
part is that it is a wired connection

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.289 
part is that it is a wired connection
which<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:35.220> problem<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.459> those<00:02:36.609> who<00:02:37.090> like

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
which is a problem for those who like

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.140 
which is a problem for those who like
wireless<00:02:37.870> connections<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.889> is<00:02:39.129> USB<00:02:39.549> powered

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
wireless connections it is USB powered

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.780 
wireless connections it is USB powered
which<00:02:40.810> means<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.889> does<00:02:42.159> work<00:02:42.459> on<00:02:42.609> your

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
which means that it does work on your

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.059 
which means that it does work on your
computer<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.359> I<00:02:43.599> mentioned<00:02:43.989> before<00:02:44.109> and<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.950> was

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
computer as I mentioned before and I was

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.490 
computer as I mentioned before and I was
in<00:02:45.189> shock<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.730> awe<00:02:46.090> when<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.629> actually<00:02:47.290> did

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
in shock and awe when it actually did

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.009 
in shock and awe when it actually did
come<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.129> work<00:02:48.639> on<00:02:48.819> my<00:02:48.970> computer<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.810> let's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
come up and work on my computer so let's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.990 
come up and work on my computer so let's
go<00:02:50.139> ahead<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.439> plug<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.950> bad<00:02:51.159> boy<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.489> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
as if it is a controller I already have

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.179 
as if it is a controller I already have
a<00:03:04.359> controller<00:03:04.750> plugged<00:03:05.049> in<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.919> number

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
a controller plugged in so the number

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.520 
a controller plugged in so the number
two<00:03:06.340> light<00:03:06.579> is<00:03:06.819> lit<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:07.900> let's<00:03:08.349> go<00:03:08.500> ahead

loud<00:03:23.019> but<00:03:23.609> then<00:03:24.609> again<00:03:24.729> that's<00:03:25.269> what<00:03:25.479> you<00:03:25.720> get

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
loud but then again that's what you get

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.379 
loud but then again that's what you get

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
with an extremely small fan like that

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.110 
with an extremely small fan like that
size<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:29.889> not<00:03:30.040> surprised<00:03:30.549> with<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> being

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
size so I'm not surprised with it being

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.390 
size so I'm not surprised with it being
loud<00:03:31.419> I'm<00:03:32.139> actually<00:03:32.349> shocked<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:32.979> it's<00:03:33.250> not

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
loud I'm actually shocked that it's not

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.289 
loud I'm actually shocked that it's not
louder<00:03:34.199> but<00:03:35.199> this<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.829> low<00:03:36.159> so<00:03:36.849> let's<00:03:37.030> turn

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
louder but this is on low so let's turn

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.869 
louder but this is on low so let's turn
it<00:03:37.479> on<00:03:37.569> high<00:03:39.419> there<00:03:40.419> we<00:03:40.780> go<00:03:41.250> now<00:03:42.250> we're<00:03:42.489> cooking

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
it on high there we go now we're cooking

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.800 
it on high there we go now we're cooking
that<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:44.620> sounds<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:45.729> your<00:03:45.970> xbox<00:03:46.479> trying

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
that that sounds like your xbox trying

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.050 
that that sounds like your xbox trying
to<00:03:47.019> cool<00:03:47.229> itself<00:03:49.139> not<00:03:50.139> bad<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.879> are

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to cool itself not bad if you are

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.759 
to cool itself not bad if you are
someone<00:03:52.780> who<00:03:52.810> has<00:03:53.849> over-the-ear<00:03:55.769> silencing

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
someone who has over-the-ear silencing

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.159 
someone who has over-the-ear silencing
headphones<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.879> don't<00:03:58.209> allow<00:03:58.479> for<00:03:58.780> exterior

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
headphones that don't allow for exterior

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.170 
headphones that don't allow for exterior
noise<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.769> come<00:03:59.919> through<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.790> would<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.150> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
noise to come through this would be a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.830 
noise to come through this would be a
very<00:04:01.569> good<00:04:01.810> choice<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.500> viable<00:04:03.040> option<00:04:03.840> if

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
very good choice and viable option if

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.800 
very good choice and viable option if
you<00:04:05.439> don't<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.489> chill<00:04:06.729> stream<00:04:07.030> man<00:04:07.299> you

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
you don't like the chill stream man you

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
you don't like the chill stream man you
don't<00:04:07.959> have<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.590> turn<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.979> on<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.159> know<00:04:09.549> you

on<00:05:23.880> this<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.510> great<00:05:24.780> controller<00:05:25.260> design

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
