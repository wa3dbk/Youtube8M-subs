00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.190 

okay<00:00:02.100> so<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.340> ran<00:00:02.610> some<00:00:02.790> tests<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.300> kind<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.020> see

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay so I ran some tests to kind of see

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay so I ran some tests to kind of see
what<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.470> difference<00:00:04.890> was<00:00:05.040> between<00:00:05.100> using

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
what the difference was between using

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.950 
what the difference was between using
single-channel<00:00:06.509> RAM<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.290> dual<00:00:07.770> channel<00:00:08.189> RAM

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
single-channel RAM and dual channel RAM

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.350 
single-channel RAM and dual channel RAM
specifically<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.260> laptops<00:00:11.360> integrated

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
specifically for laptops integrated

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.829 
specifically for laptops integrated
graphics<00:00:12.590> use<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.889> laptops<00:00:14.370> Ram<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:15.089> video

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
graphics use the laptops Ram as video

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
graphics use the laptops Ram as video
RAM<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.529> opposed<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> discrete<00:00:17.490> cards<00:00:18.150> which

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
RAM as opposed to discrete cards which

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.750 
RAM as opposed to discrete cards which
have<00:00:18.330> their<00:00:18.570> own<00:00:18.630> built<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.140> memory<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.640> it's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
have their own built in memory so it's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
have their own built in memory so it's
obviously<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> affect<00:00:21.449> integrated

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
obviously going to affect integrated

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.470 
obviously going to affect integrated
graphics<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.769> lot<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> did<00:00:24.150> i've

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
