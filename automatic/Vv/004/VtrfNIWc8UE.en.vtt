00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.770 
say that maybe Fiat really really oily
hair<00:02:28.040> would<00:02:28.280> work<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.000> if<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.209> have<00:02:29.300> normal

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

to<00:02:29.900> dry<00:02:29.930> hair<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.620> wouldn't<00:02:31.340> suggest<00:02:31.459> using

to dry hair I wouldn't suggest using
this<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.500> thing<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.739> sucks<00:02:34.130> those<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
this the one thing that sucks those that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.449 
this the one thing that sucks those that
it<00:02:34.640> smells<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.000> good<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.810> smells<00:02:36.080> like<00:02:36.459> like

strawberry<00:02:37.970> yogurt<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.510> think<00:02:38.780> that's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
strawberry yogurt I think that's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.870 
strawberry yogurt I think that's
actually<00:02:39.260> what<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.410> says<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.489> supposed<00:02:40.610> to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
actually what it says it's supposed to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.520 
actually what it says it's supposed to
be<00:02:41.030> strawberry<00:02:41.510> yogurt<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.110> smells<00:02:42.230> really

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
be strawberry yogurt so it smells really

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.670 
be strawberry yogurt so it smells really
good<00:02:42.769> but<00:02:43.360> dry<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.690> drying<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
good but dry it's very drying and so I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.280

through<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.739> hair<00:03:37.030> um<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.120> think<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.720> can

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
through your hair um I think you can

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
think that's kind of gross because of

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.920 
think that's kind of gross because of
like<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:43.519> could<00:03:43.670> hairs<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.390> stuff<00:03:44.600> but

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
like you could hairs on it and stuff but

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.380 
like you could hairs on it and stuff but
you<00:03:45.500> can<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:45.920> cut<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.910> really<00:03:47.209> huge

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
you can you cut this is a really huge

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.360 
you can you cut this is a really huge
piece<00:03:47.690> actually<00:03:47.930> cut<00:03:48.440> like<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.709> little<00:03:49.100> piece

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
piece actually cut like a little piece

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.699 
piece actually cut like a little piece
off<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.360> could<00:03:50.480> use<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
off so that I could use it and the

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.199 
off so that I could use it and the
shower<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:52.160> smaller<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:52.910> like<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.120> was

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
shower like smaller but like it was

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.710 
shower like smaller but like it was
easier<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.540> use<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.859> have<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.250> say<00:03:55.720> this

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
easier to use and I have to say this

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
maybe it has a little

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.610 
maybe it has a little
bit<00:04:01.189> because<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.879> I<00:04:02.239> really<00:04:02.959> really<00:04:03.230> like<00:04:03.409> that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
bit because I I really really like that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.100 
bit because I I really really like that
shampoo<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.370> really<00:04:04.730> don't<00:04:04.909> like<00:04:05.110> sulfates

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
shampoo and I really don't like sulfates

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.259 
shampoo and I really don't like sulfates
but<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.860> felt<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.489> gives<00:04:07.670> my<00:04:07.819> hair<00:04:07.849> a<00:04:08.060> lot

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
but I felt like it gives my hair a lot

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.259 
but I felt like it gives my hair a lot
of<00:04:08.450> volume<00:04:08.689> it<00:04:09.379> gives<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.129> lot<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.310> body<00:04:10.610> it's

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
of volume it gives it a lot of body it's

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.229 
of volume it gives it a lot of body it's
not<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:12.170> doesn't<00:04:12.230> strip<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.640> ends<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:14.060> my<00:04:14.090> hair

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
not it doesn't strip the ends of my hair

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.780 
not it doesn't strip the ends of my hair
it<00:04:14.689> doesn't<00:04:14.870> make<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.140> feel<00:04:15.200> dry<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.609> also

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
it doesn't make it feel dry and I also

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.439 
it doesn't make it feel dry and I also
got<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.539> American<00:04:18.410> cream<00:04:19.180> double<00:04:20.180> strength

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
got the American cream double strength

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.020 
got the American cream double strength
conditioner<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.709> go<00:04:21.889> with<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.910> think

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
conditioner to go with it and I think

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.150 
conditioner to go with it and I think
together<00:04:23.510> these<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.770> work<00:04:24.949> really

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
together these they they work really

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.330 
together these they they work really
well<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:26.810> one<00:04:27.020> has<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:27.410> strawberries<00:04:28.070> and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
well this one has like strawberries and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.909 
well this one has like strawberries and
orange<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.180> fresh<00:04:29.389> vanilla<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.289> I<00:04:30.710> don't

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
orange and fresh vanilla and I don't

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.379 
orange and fresh vanilla and I don't
really<00:04:31.100> like<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.430> scent<00:04:31.669> of<00:04:31.760> vanilla<00:04:31.880> but

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
really like the scent of vanilla but

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.820 
really like the scent of vanilla but
again<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.840> don't<00:04:32.900> think<00:04:33.199> it<00:04:33.289> smells<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:33.620> much

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
again I don't think it smells so much

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.360 
again I don't think it smells so much
like<00:04:33.889> vanilla<00:04:34.400> um<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:36.650> reason<00:04:36.770> why<00:04:37.039> they<00:04:37.190> use

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
like vanilla um the reason why they use

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.960 
like vanilla um the reason why they use
vanilla<00:04:37.669> is<00:04:37.850> because<00:04:38.120> vanilla<00:04:38.449> is<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> natural

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
vanilla is because vanilla is a natural

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.939 
vanilla is because vanilla is a natural
it<00:04:41.050> naturally<00:04:42.050> keeps<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.410> moisture<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.860> your

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
it naturally keeps the moisture in your

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.400 
it naturally keeps the moisture in your
hair<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.120> thought<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:44.750> was<00:04:44.930> really<00:04:45.139> good

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
hair so I thought this was really good

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.680 
hair so I thought this was really good
and<00:04:45.560> paired<00:04:45.860> together<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:47.060> far<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.479> is<00:04:47.660> my

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
and paired together so far this is my

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.860 
and paired together so far this is my

clean<00:05:56.360> enough<00:05:56.389> because<00:05:57.349> I<00:05:57.500> I've<00:05:57.800> heard<00:05:58.159> that

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
clean enough because I I've heard that

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.950 
clean enough because I I've heard that
if<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.669> use<00:05:58.699> some<00:05:59.240> stuff<00:05:59.659> with<00:05:59.840> like

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
if you use some stuff with like

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.189 
if you use some stuff with like
silicones<00:06:00.560> in<00:06:00.770> it<00:06:00.979> for<00:06:01.669> like<00:06:01.940> styling<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:03.169> a

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
silicones in it for like styling like a

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.920 
silicones in it for like styling like a
moose<00:06:03.560> or<00:06:03.919> like<00:06:04.070> a<00:06:04.099> volumizer<00:06:04.669> with<00:06:04.970> silicones

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
moose or like a volumizer with silicones

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.020 
moose or like a volumizer with silicones
something<00:06:06.710> that<00:06:06.830> doesn't<00:06:07.190> have<00:06:07.220> any<00:06:07.729> type<00:06:08.000> of

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
something that doesn't have any type of

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.900 
something that doesn't have any type of
sulfate<00:06:08.630> can't<00:06:09.169> clean<00:06:09.830> your<00:06:10.070> hair<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:10.729> it

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
sulfate can't clean your hair so it

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.939 
sulfate can't clean your hair so it
won't<00:06:11.120> get<00:06:11.389> rid<00:06:11.570> of<00:06:11.630> that<00:06:11.780> silicone<00:06:12.530> build<00:06:12.770> up

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
won't get rid of that silicone build up

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.430 
won't get rid of that silicone build up
so<00:06:13.550> we'll<00:06:13.669> just<00:06:13.729> kind<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.150> make<00:06:14.389> for<00:06:15.199> me<00:06:15.320> it

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
so we'll just kind of make for me it

so we'll just kind of make for me it
made<00:06:15.650> my<00:06:16.250> roots<00:06:16.550> really<00:06:16.940> greasy<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.660> my<00:06:17.840> ends

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
made my roots really greasy and my ends

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.499 
made my roots really greasy and my ends
fine<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.340> it<00:06:19.430> just<00:06:19.490> was<00:06:19.759> like<00:06:19.880> a<00:06:19.940> weird

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
fine so it just was like a weird

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.610 
fine so it just was like a weird
combination<00:06:21.940> so<00:06:22.940> far<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:24.050> products<00:06:24.470> that<00:06:24.500> I

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
free shampoo I think it's really good it

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.740 
free shampoo I think it's really good it
is<00:06:30.800> kind<00:06:31.100> of<00:06:31.220> out<00:06:31.910> twenty<00:06:32.210> dollars<00:06:32.479> a<00:06:32.509> bottle

so<00:06:33.050> it<00:06:33.080> is<00:06:33.289> a<00:06:33.320> little<00:06:33.530> bit<00:06:33.710> pricey<00:06:33.979> but<00:06:34.190> you

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
so it is a little bit pricey but you

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.719 
so it is a little bit pricey but you
don't<00:06:34.580> have<00:06:34.699> to<00:06:34.759> use<00:06:35.060> too<00:06:35.270> much<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.860> this<00:06:37.460> well
