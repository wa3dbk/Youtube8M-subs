00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.040 
the bolt leader and that's going to
allow<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.349> to<00:02:05.910> feed<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.090> block<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.929> bolt

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
allow you to feed the block and bolt

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.990 
allow you to feed the block and bolt
assembly<00:02:08.530> through<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.830> frame<00:02:09.099> into<00:02:09.580> position

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
assembly through the frame into position

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.790 
assembly through the frame into position
and<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.780> we're<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.020> do<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.290> feed<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> up

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
and what we're going to do is feed it up

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.559 
and what we're going to do is feed it up
through<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.250> hole<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.550> we're<00:02:12.670> using<00:02:13.000> and

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
through the hole that we're using and

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.360 
through the hole that we're using and
back<00:02:13.780> out<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.770> access<00:02:15.130> hole

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
back out the access hole

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.920 
back out the access hole
let<00:02:15.940> me<00:02:16.000> want<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.239> feed<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> bolt<00:02:16.599> leader<00:02:16.690> in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
let me want to feed the bolt leader in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.710 
let me want to feed the bolt leader in
through<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.170> block<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:18.520> wrap<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
through the block and then wrap the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.240 
through the block and then wrap the
threads<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.230> bolt<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> bolt<00:02:21.220> leader

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
threads of the bolt with the bolt leader

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.710 
threads of the bolt with the bolt leader
and<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.849> will<00:02:21.970> allow<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.420> pull<00:02:22.599> it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and that will allow us to pull it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.460 
and that will allow us to pull it
through<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> frame<00:02:23.260> here<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:26.110> want<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.349> make

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
through the frame here we want to make

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.699 
through the frame here we want to make

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the bolts pulled down through the frame

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.740 
the bolts pulled down through the frame
here<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.209> ahead<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.359> put<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.599> hitch

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
here we can go ahead and put the hitch

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.360 
here we can go ahead and put the hitch
up<00:02:58.780> into<00:02:58.959> position<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.799> instructions<00:03:00.250> say<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
up into position the instructions say to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.860 
up into position the instructions say to
go<00:03:00.549> ahead<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.819> put<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> bolts<00:03:01.629> into<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
go ahead and put the bolts into the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.869 
go ahead and put the bolts into the
crossmember<00:03:02.409> first<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.129> then<00:03:03.459> put<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> hitch

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
crossmember first and then put the hitch

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.330 
crossmember first and then put the hitch
up<00:03:03.909> but<00:03:04.569> putting<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.590> hitch<00:03:05.709> up<00:03:05.890> before<00:03:06.159> you

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
up but putting the hitch up before you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.710 
up but putting the hitch up before you
put<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.700> bolts<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> crossmember<00:03:07.569> will

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
put the bolts and the crossmember will

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.940 
put the bolts and the crossmember will
actually<00:03:07.959> make<00:03:08.200> they're<00:03:08.379> less<00:03:08.560> likely<00:03:08.920> chance

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
actually make they're less likely chance

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.890 
actually make they're less likely chance
that<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.579> will<00:03:09.730> push<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> bolts<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.629> into<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900

frame<00:03:11.079> while<00:03:11.319> installing<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.250> I'm<00:03:12.639> gonna

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
frame while installing it so I'm gonna

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.309 
frame while installing it so I'm gonna
go<00:03:12.849> ahead<00:03:12.909> and<00:03:13.000> do<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.269> after<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> mounted<00:03:14.260> up

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
go ahead and do that after it mounted up

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.110 
go ahead and do that after it mounted up
