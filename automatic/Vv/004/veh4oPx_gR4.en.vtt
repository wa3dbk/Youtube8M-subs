rebounds down to the playing surface or

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.020 
rebounds down to the playing surface or
also<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> gives<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> extra

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
also it gives you a little bit of extra

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
also it gives you a little bit of extra
wrist<00:00:36.300> mobility<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.220> taking<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
wrist mobility right there and taking a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
wrist mobility right there and taking a
look<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> actual<00:00:39.300> protection<00:00:39.630> on<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
look at the actual protection on the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
look at the actual protection on the
inside<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
inside here you can see they have that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
inside here you can see they have that
nice<00:00:42.360> thick<00:00:42.750> softer<00:00:43.470> foam<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.130> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
then it goes into a really really dense

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
then it goes into a really really dense
foam<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.040> there<00:00:47.220> that's<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.880> half<00:00:48.510> an

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

foam right there that's about a half an
inch<00:00:48.809> thick<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.380> then<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
inch thick and then you also have that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.100 
inch thick and then you also have that
plastic<00:00:50.730> insert<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.630> there<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.050> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
plastic insert right there so that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.810 
plastic insert right there so that
combination<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.010> gives<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.610> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
great protection on this one and then

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400 
great protection on this one and then
going<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> backside<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.260> can
