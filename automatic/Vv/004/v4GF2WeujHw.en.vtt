hi I'm dr. Julie Steiner and today we're
going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.970> talk<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.389> eye<00:00:03.629> turns<00:00:03.959> with

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
going to talk about eye turns with

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.200 
going to talk about eye turns with
strabismus<00:00:04.470> surgery<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> use<00:00:06.060> this

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
strabismus surgery I'm going to use this

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.909 
strabismus surgery I'm going to use this
ball<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.600> kind<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.839> help<00:00:07.020> us<00:00:07.109> get<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> visual<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
ball to kind of help us get a visual of

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.560 
ball to kind of help us get a visual of
what<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.280> muscles<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> eyes<00:00:09.179> kind<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
what the muscles on the eyes kind of

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.629 
what the muscles on the eyes kind of
tend<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> do<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.920> our<00:00:11.040> purposes<00:00:11.280> today

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
tend to do so for our purposes today

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.009 
tend to do so for our purposes today
we're<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.300> talk<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> couple

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
we're going to talk about a couple

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.860 
we're going to talk about a couple
muscles<00:00:13.530> there's<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> muscle<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.790> down<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
muscles there's a muscle up down to the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
muscles there's a muscle up down to the
sides<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.440> kind<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.800> diagonal<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:18.390> we

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
sides and kind of a diagonal and what we

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660 
sides and kind of a diagonal and what we
want<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> think<00:00:19.050> about<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.560> most<00:00:19.800> surgeries

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
want to think about in most surgeries

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.429 
want to think about in most surgeries
for<00:00:20.910> eye<00:00:21.090> turns<00:00:21.449> we're<00:00:21.720> usually<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.260> an<00:00:22.350> eye

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
for eye turns we're usually have an eye

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349 
for eye turns we're usually have an eye
that's<00:00:22.650> running<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:23.970> eye<00:00:24.090> that's

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that's running in or an eye that's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.790 
that's running in or an eye that's
turning<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.109> we're<00:00:25.260> usually<00:00:25.410> talking

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
turning out so we're usually talking

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220 
turning out so we're usually talking
about<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> muscles<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> side<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.510> when

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
about the muscles on the side here when

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.769 
about the muscles on the side here when
we<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> nice<00:00:29.160> turn<00:00:29.699> surgery<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.539> either

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
we have a nice turn surgery we either

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.590 
we have a nice turn surgery we either
will<00:00:31.170> cut<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> chunk<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.640> muscle<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.149> or

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
will cut a chunk of a muscle out or

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
will cut a chunk of a muscle out or
we'll<00:00:33.960> lengthen<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> longer<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
we'll lengthen one and make it longer in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.600 
we'll lengthen one and make it longer in
order<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> allow<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> Ida<00:00:36.899> line<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.380> properly

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
order to allow the Ida line up properly

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.940 
order to allow the Ida line up properly
the<00:00:38.610> problem<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.230> couple

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the problem with that which is a couple

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
the problem with that which is a couple
things<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
things but one of them is that when you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
things but one of them is that when you
do<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.670> very

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
do that you have to be really very

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.150 
do that you have to be really very
precise<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> accurate<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.920> other

precise and accurate because these other

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
precise and accurate because these other
muscles<00:00:47.670> especially<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.300> ones<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
muscles especially the ones that the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.200 
muscles especially the ones that the
angles<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.800> tend<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> cause<00:00:50.370> problems<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
angles will tend to cause problems and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
angles will tend to cause problems and

or<00:00:54.059> eye<00:00:54.180> turns<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.289> end<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.559> seeing<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
or eye turns what we end up seeing is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.490 
or eye turns what we end up seeing is
maybe<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.760> part<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> alignment<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
maybe this part of it the alignment in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
maybe this part of it the alignment in
or<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.160> corrected<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.090> we'll<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.420> an

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
or out got corrected but we'll see an

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
or out got corrected but we'll see an
upward<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.050> turn<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.590> what's<00:01:02.250> called<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.550> cyclic

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
upward I turn or what's called a cyclic

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
upward I turn or what's called a cyclic
torsion<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.750> tricky<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
torsion which is really tricky and that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
torsion which is really tricky and that
kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> makes<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> eyeball<00:01:05.640> rotate<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
kind of makes the eyeball rotate up and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
kind of makes the eyeball rotate up and
spin<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.530> angle<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.970> those<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.420> things

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
spin at an angle and so those are things

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
spin at an angle and so those are things
that<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.840> extremely<00:01:10.350> common<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.040> say<00:01:11.189> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that are extremely common I would say in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
that are extremely common I would say in
most<00:01:11.490> surgeries<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.180> ends<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.540> happening

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
most surgeries that ends up happening

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.070 
most surgeries that ends up happening
post<00:01:13.560> surgery<00:01:14.189> seen<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.820> upward<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> cyclo

post surgery seen an upward or a cyclo

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
post surgery seen an upward or a cyclo
torsion<00:01:16.439> version<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> those<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.299> very

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
torsion version and those are very

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
torsion version and those are very
tricky<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.020> deal<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> biggest

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
tricky to deal with so the biggest

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
tricky to deal with so the biggest
problems<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> strabismus<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.259> turn

problems with a strabismus and I turn
surgery<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.070> tricky<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.270> everything

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

especially<00:01:29.070> after<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.119> would

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
especially after you have what we would

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.429 
especially after you have what we would
consider<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.659> normal<00:01:31.049> healing<00:01:31.290> process

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.649 
consider the normal healing process
where<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> muscles<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.790> actually<00:01:33.240> tend<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
lay a little scar tissue around them and
that<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.329> cause<00:01:36.720> contracture<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that can actually cause contracture and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.280 
that can actually cause contracture and
pull<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> eye<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.400> positions<00:01:38.729> so

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
pull the eye up in those positions so

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.630 
pull the eye up in those positions so
that's<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> second<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that's one thing the second thing is is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.160 
that's one thing the second thing is is
that<00:01:41.759> actually<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> brain<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> control

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that actually the brain is the control

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
that actually the brain is the control
center<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.130> muscles<00:01:44.490> everyone<00:01:45.479> says

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
center and not the muscles everyone says

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
center and not the muscles everyone says
it's<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> muscles<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's the muscles but it's not the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
it's the muscles but it's not the
muscles<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.600> only<00:01:49.020> affecting<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
muscles so if you're only affecting the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.570 
muscles so if you're only affecting the
muscles<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> problem<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.270> have

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
muscles then the problem is you have

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.550 
muscles then the problem is you have
treated<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.180> brain<00:01:52.480> which<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.050> controlling

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
treated the brain which is controlling

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.760 
treated the brain which is controlling
them<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.330> after<00:01:55.330> surgery<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:56.110> might<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.590> an

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
them and after surgery you might have an

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.040 
them and after surgery you might have an
eye<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:56.920> had<00:01:57.250> turned<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.670> line<00:01:58.540> up<00:01:58.750> straight

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
eye that had turned in line up straight

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.740 
eye that had turned in line up straight
but<00:01:59.230> maybe<00:01:59.410> little<00:01:59.830> toward<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.220> up<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.750> then

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
but maybe little toward it up and then

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.020 
but maybe little toward it up and then
whenever<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.620> eye<00:02:02.650> heals<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.580> all<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
whenever the eye heals and all of the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.090 
whenever the eye heals and all of the
muscles<00:02:04.390> heal<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.170> contraction<00:02:05.830> kind

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
muscles heal and that contraction kind

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.340 
muscles heal and that contraction kind
of<00:02:06.220> goes<00:02:06.730> away<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.690> may<00:02:07.810> still<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
of goes away you may still have that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.500 
of goes away you may still have that
upward<00:02:08.680> eye<00:02:08.770> turn<00:02:09.040> but<00:02:09.700> then<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.090> brain<00:02:10.300> may

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
upward eye turn but then the brain may

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.300 
upward eye turn but then the brain may
actually<00:02:10.720> put<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.200> eye<00:02:11.230> back<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.770> again<00:02:11.980> over

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
actually put that eye back in again over

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.560 
actually put that eye back in again over
time<00:02:12.460> just<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:12.910> that's<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> way<00:02:13.390> it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570
