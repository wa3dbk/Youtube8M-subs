00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.559
 a lot of jean maury girls for a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
 very small and but for a very good 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.740
 good plan but I think I think that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.180
 you're glad if it's a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 product that you like then you will you 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.020
 remember at some time I had you 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 talked about the benefit high beam that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.619
 I had seen in these little boxes that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.150
 had made it beneficial 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.599
 I think it's always discovering and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 list here and so I love his product 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.790
 in fact it's true that I never have I 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.559
 believe he is reelected but in my 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
 favorites and yet I'm using it I'm 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.010
 be used every day in general I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200
 mixing the foundation and finally 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.390
 I really like coasts 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.690
 it's a minor of the readers is actually 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 some time ago by doing a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.410
 shop on the internet 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.840
 I came across a shop on 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.199
 amazon who are you asking and who is 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.760
 proposed that's it so it's really damn to me 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.920
 sort because you can see it at 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.239
 packagings level so that's good 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 it's not the full size normally the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 crowd knowing benefit made 13 10 liters 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 and this one on the other hand makes 12 min good 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 here is not going to quibble 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 but otherwise I saw it's pretty much the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.869
 same typo they changed two three 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 stuff to say that the packaging it is 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.610
 really really identical what and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 so the product itself 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 so at benefit you have a tool 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 a little tip a little man at 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.549
 brush and then at technical so who 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 has an aluminum called 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.189
 highlights frankly if it's not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.659
 the copy if he knows that's so here you are 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.470
 then have the brush clearly that's 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.340
 not the same quality 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.979
 it's a thing that you can do anything 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.640
 the texture of the long the minor is more 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.710
 thick that the salt of dueling mime 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 so here we see the difference 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.009
 tintin difference is not huge 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.689
 but there were some, but you 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.329
 go see it's really not that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.290
 this is the highlight and his celulle is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.350
 went for my manicure and that's the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.330
 unanimity here you see the high beam 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.430
 is slightly more pink and when you 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.940
 work there is absolutely no 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.310
 difference 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.509
 they have exactly the same effect it does 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.960
 several days that I test the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.280
 technical highlight 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.650
 frankly it has exactly the same effects 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.570
 he's holding a tiara as well this 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.480
 difference and she's size it's 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.290
 the price because the abyss so full 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.790
 size is 24 euros and there it costs 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.800
 to the seller the seller amazon I 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.110
 will put the link down it costs 3 euros 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.180
 0.7 and the shipping costs are 2 euros 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.900
 20 so do the math that's 5 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.550
 euros 27 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.530
 so that's 24 euros and 5 euros 27 what 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.670
 here I think that that I think it's 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 not too serious that the past care 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.970
 for before I think that's knowing 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.830
 that the product exactly the same 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.240
 and frankly I'm really happy 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.860
 to have found okay that 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.000
 did not make any difference what really 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.890
 the difference in hue 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.330
 in fact when we apply it we see it 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 not at all mixed with the foundation 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.610
 he was called who this mix very very 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.230
 although there is no concern 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.540
 if you want to apply it like that in 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.850
 highlight also fears he is nickel 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.530
 what frankly except that the difference 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.970
 price is going to top what 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.100
 Resellers went very very well 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.860
 I was delivered I seem to me in one 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.900
 week was packed so in a 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.970
 little paper like that ollier who 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.070
 wrapped up I had a doubt of the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.780
 bill here with a retail of the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.010
 bill was very well packed finally 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 he will however warn valérie 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.030
 had been packed yes in a small 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.380
 cardboard like that with a little more 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.010
 bubble wrap which thirty years ago there was 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.480
 no problem 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.390
 it's a seller I found on 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.380
 amazon france maybe we can 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.780
 find somewhere else so I know that 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.100
 technical it's a brand that go from 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.840
 it's a cheap brand at any 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.070
 small prices that go from England 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.299
 improbable what do I like 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.130
 England but it's okay I think 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.970
 what are you sending more and more 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.010
 of products that attract me to 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.930
 england i'm like snapped up towards 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.340
 england but storage finally I 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.350
 I am super happy to share 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.030
 this good bread with you tell me if you 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.780
 hesitate to buy it if it's a product 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.850
 which interests them 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.890
 vim but the price you brake because 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.230
 that it is true that the price is what he 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.000
 not given what 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.709
 but tell me tell me if that you if 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.560
 you time you're silhouette me a 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.720
 little bit of elbows says why 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.090
 months that girls a common element 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.130
 if it's a product here you're 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.989
 interest you want to buy but 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.430
 that here is the pre slow down too much said 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.840
 me if it's a product you like 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.299
 or not because you do not like the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.320
 abyss makes a tiny little one 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.459
 good plans we'll finally say it's I 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.860
 think it's a very good 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.210
 plan but but soon I think that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.800
 I'll have some more stuff 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.870
 to show you frankly I'm having fun 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.820
 end to prepare you this kind of video 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.290
 frankly it would be nice to think about 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.880
 something you tell me if that you 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.580
 try or not if you do not like it 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.870
 a worry we do not do I thought that 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.360
 it could be fun to make you 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.040
 a kind of special Christmas role 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.870
 but in fact that has nothing to do with the 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.979
 makeup that was it was just I was 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.660
 will not do it I see all the time because 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.060
 that it's not kind of stuff that that 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.650
 I love doing too much but I 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.720
 I'm told that it's good Christmas 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.979
 and what's more for me it 's Christmas is a 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.600
 little particular this year so 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:01.240
 so that's for a lot of reasons it's okay 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.030
 to do that will make this angle that I have not 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.120
 spend Christmas with my family so here 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.550
 I am a little bit and here I am with 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.750
 my parents all that so 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.000
 so I am very very very happy to 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.380
 christmas what will make sense to me and 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.830
 I thought it might be 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.570
 friendly 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.450
 here I confess that these last 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.650
 Christmas years it was not very 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.390
 jeweler for me here we are not going 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.590
 to enter a detail because that's it 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.840
 not interesting 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.150
 that's my but I thought that 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.420
 could be nice 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.430
 here is finally me I rediscover I 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.280
 find a little Christmas joys these 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.700
 last time contact a lot thanks to 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.370
 my daughter 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.160
 this gives such full period 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.600
 of Christmas costs thoroughly so that's it 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.960
 and it's true that make this year christmas 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.550
 it makes sense a little sorry I have a 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.280
 little bit and I'm teaching you instance a 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.870
 little particular for me so so voila 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.820
 my christmas is not for me it's not 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.100
 synonym necessarily of view only of 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.990
 those of shopping and stuff like that 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.360
 but logical if it tempts you and I 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.690
 could I could do a special role 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.040
 Christmas 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.780
 that's it I said to myself if you told me 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.020
 it tempts you or not thierry fis to 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.020
 soon
