00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
high-res texture alright let me start

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.349 
high-res texture alright let me start
off<00:00:20.039> by<00:00:20.100> talking<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:24.380> 1.9<00:00:25.380> edge<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:29.130> edge

off by talking about 1.9 edge this edge
will<00:00:30.359> enable<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.199> direct<00:00:31.650> x<00:00:31.800> 11<00:00:32.219> support<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
will enable the direct x 11 support and

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.740 
will enable the direct x 11 support and
I'll<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> I'll<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> later<00:00:35.750> but

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
I'll get that I'll get to that later but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.040 
I'll get that I'll get to that later but
for<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> 1.9

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
for first things first about the 1.9

for first things first about the 1.9
patch<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:41.129> adds<00:00:41.600> contact<00:00:42.600> shadows<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.260> don't

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
patch it adds contact shadows I don't

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
patch it adds contact shadows I don't
fully<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> means<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> think

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
fully know what that means but I think

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
fully know what that means but I think
the<00:00:46.770> shadows<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> lot<00:00:49.200> better

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the shadows are going to be a lot better

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.439 
the shadows are going to be a lot better
in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.219> game<00:00:50.399> since<00:00:50.640> there's<00:00:50.850> been<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
in the game since there's been a lot of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.049 
in the game since there's been a lot of
bugs<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.250> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> shadows<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
bugs with the with the shadows in this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.770 
bugs with the with the shadows in this
game<00:00:55.670> obviously<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
game obviously it's going to have the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
game obviously it's going to have the
direct<00:00:58.170> excellent<00:00:58.739> support<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.460> said<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
direct excellent support like I said the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.230 
direct excellent support like I said the
directx<00:01:03.180> 11<00:01:03.690> support<00:01:04.320> part<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> 1.9

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
directx 11 support part for the 1.9

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.990 
directx 11 support part for the 1.9
patch<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:07.020> includes<00:01:07.640> tessellation<00:01:08.640> plus

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
patch it includes tessellation plus

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.380 
patch it includes tessellation plus
displacement<00:01:09.600> mapping<00:01:10.170> um<00:01:11.240> tessellation<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
displacement mapping um tessellation is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.590 
displacement mapping um tessellation is
like<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.900> higher<00:01:13.409> level<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.310> graphics<00:01:14.880> which

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
like a higher level of graphics which

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.609 
like a higher level of graphics which
makes<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.880> environment<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.030> say<00:01:18.600> bricks<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
makes the environment like say bricks a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
makes the environment like say bricks a
lot<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.310> vivid<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.240> lifelike<00:01:22.520> um<00:01:23.520> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
lot more vivid and more lifelike um in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.590 
lot more vivid and more lifelike um in
the<00:01:24.330> video<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.770> why<00:01:26.040> director

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the video game which is why director

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.890 
the video game which is why director
really<00:01:27.979> wanted<00:01:28.979> bird<00:01:29.509> for<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> game

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
really wanted bird for this game

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.010 
really wanted bird for this game
especially<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> net<00:01:33.830> also<00:01:34.830> now

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.249 

and<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.409> high<00:01:39.039> quality<00:01:39.369> HDR<00:01:40.119> motion<00:01:40.539> motion

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
and in high quality HDR motion motion

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.539 
and in high quality HDR motion motion
blur<00:01:43.140> motion<00:01:44.140> there<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.679> motion<00:01:44.890> blur<00:01:45.189> already

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
blur motion there is motion blur already

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.649 
blur motion there is motion blur already
but<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:45.850> guess<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.240> going<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.509> better

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
but I guess it's going to get better

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.389 
but I guess it's going to get better
he's<00:01:47.350> also<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.799> be<00:01:47.920> as<00:01:48.070> realistic

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
he's also going to be as realistic

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.660 
he's also going to be as realistic
shadows<00:01:48.969> with<00:01:49.240> variable<00:01:49.950> rocking<00:01:50.950> make<00:01:51.429> sure

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
shadows with variable rocking make sure

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.289 
shadows with variable rocking make sure
that<00:01:51.969> is<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.530> not<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.770> hotel<00:01:54.299> there's

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
that is but it's not the hotel there's

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.429 
that is but it's not the hotel there's
also<00:01:55.479> sprite-based<00:01:56.490> okay<00:01:58.649> captain<00:01:59.649> feel

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
also sprite-based okay captain feel

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.790 
also sprite-based okay captain feel
Arnab<00:02:02.439> saying<00:02:02.829> all<00:02:03.069> these

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.040 

I<00:02:06.730> relax<00:02:08.040> occlusion<00:02:09.040> mapping<00:02:09.660> them<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.869> either

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
I relax occlusion mapping them is either

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
I relax occlusion mapping them is either
there's<00:02:11.800> particles<00:02:12.430> motion<00:02:12.850> blur<00:02:13.030> shadows

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
there's particles motion blur shadows

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.570 
there's particles motion blur shadows
and<00:02:13.900> our<00:02:14.230> cup<00:02:14.440> days<00:02:14.620> i<00:02:14.800> guess<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:15.280> gonna

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and our cup days i guess that's gonna

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.410 
and our cup days i guess that's gonna
make<00:02:15.760> every<00:02:16.480> single<00:02:16.630> graphic<00:02:17.620> better<00:02:18.420> also

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
make every single graphic better also

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
make every single graphic better also
there<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> water<00:02:21.040> rendering<00:02:21.580> improvement<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
there a water rendering improvement and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.640 
there a water rendering improvement and
placement<00:02:24.790> mapping<00:02:25.150> that's<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.230> think<00:02:26.500> it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
placement mapping that's I think it's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.940 
placement mapping that's I think it's
gonna<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.010> mostly<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.610> like<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.800> is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
gonna be mostly for like all this is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.190 
gonna be mostly for like all this is
going<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.510> hopefully<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> notch<00:02:31.780> okay<00:02:31.930> i

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
going to be hopefully a notch okay i

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.660 
going to be hopefully a notch okay i
mean<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.250> multiplayer<00:02:34.180> which<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
mean it is and multiplayer which is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.110 
mean it is and multiplayer which is
rejected<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.870> 1.9<00:02:38.800> edge<00:02:39.160> there's<00:02:39.700> they're

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
rejected for 1.9 edge there's they're

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.750 
rejected for 1.9 edge there's they're
adding<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.690> real<00:02:41.230> time<00:02:41.560> location<00:02:41.760> reflections

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
adding in real time location reflections

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.150 
adding in real time location reflections
I<00:02:42.970> guess<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> reflection<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.380> such<00:02:44.650> mirrors

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
I guess the reflection in such mirrors

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.190 
I guess the reflection in such mirrors
windows<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:45.940> whatnot<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.810> water<00:02:47.050> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
windows and whatnot and the water is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.200 
windows and whatnot and the water is
gonna<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> lot<00:02:47.830> better<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:48.790> gonna<00:02:48.940> add
