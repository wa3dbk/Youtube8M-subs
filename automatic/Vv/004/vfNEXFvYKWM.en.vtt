00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
later so first up let's do some people

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.780 
later so first up let's do some people
so<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.289> cut<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.650> red<00:00:32.160> onion<00:00:32.369> into

eighths you have to cut the potatoes and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
eighths you have to cut the potatoes and
different<00:00:36.239> sizes<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.530> sweet<00:00:37.739> potato

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
different sizes because the sweet potato

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
different sizes because the sweet potato
cooks<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.520> quicker<00:00:38.760> than<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> normal<00:00:39.360> potato

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.549 
so we'll cut this into large chunks and
that<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:42.540> smaller<00:00:42.809> chunks<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.290> ready

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that into smaller chunks so it's ready
