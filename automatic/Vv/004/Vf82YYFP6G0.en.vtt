00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello how about youtube friends i am your 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 friend angel montiel and be welcome 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.799
 once again to a review completely on 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.260
 Spanish about the amazing world of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 rubik cubes me today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.619
 found with a bit strange piece 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.070
 and funny that is the amazing 3 x 3 with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.350
 finished concave so it's not not bad 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.539
 our camera knows perfectly well that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.439
 record in high fucking definition high 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.390
 fucking then you're not looking bad no 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 move to your computer no no no no 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 do not stay where you are to watch this video 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 delegate m 10 because effectively this 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 Curved and concave finishing bucket is a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.550
 something strange and crazy edition of the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 traditional rubik cube how can you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 see this cube has a part sunk to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.870
 center that starts from its edges and from 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 its corners towards the center and it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 it starts to be wavy it starts to be 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.420
 concave inward in each of its 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 faces and it does like a waist like 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.059
 outside a woman a little waist like that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.689
 little girl 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.700
 and it makes this cube very handsome and flirty 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.500
 I found it the truth is that no no 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.119
 it has a brand I think it's made by a fan 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.630
 a strange brand and half of cubes 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.320
 rubik called falcon and I could not 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.179
 resist me to buy it because then I 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.950
 the design of the cube attracted attention and 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.289
 I was dying to see their internal parts 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.780
 let's see the comparison with a cube 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.539
 of traditional rubik as you can see yes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.799
 The concave part is very clear 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.720
 has this cube compared to this one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.229
 yes yes yes yes I know if you get to notice 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.950
 see it in the distance as if it looks concave 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.039
 both sides 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.549
 the depth of the cube look as if 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.890
 he manages to notice these differences and what 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.069
 What I liked most is that he bought this cube 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.069
 it comes to my house and I realize that 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.640
 tour excellent way tour very very 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.960
 well see nothing else what good performance 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.510
 have 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.470
 even though it has that concave finish 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.000
 the cube rotates excellently see 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.280
 nothing more this 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 no no no what beauty of juice 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.050
 is designed to do speed olvin yo 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.330
 I would not say that say that 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.980
 it only has a very good finish and 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.050
 I also liked that it is in version 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.590
 blusher so I'll never have to 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.810
 worry about changing the stickers I 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 He liked it so much that I bought two but 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 I must be honest this will restore it 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.890
 because unfortunately this cube 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.670
 concave enjoys poor quality in its 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.610
 materials and this cube to the room at 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.040
 fifth solve that I gave him broke the core 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 on the inside and I cried a lot 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.050
 because my cube was broken I do not know if it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.269
 should it have been a factory damage 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.060
 I do not know if it is because my bucket went wrong 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.100
 but if it broke I should be honest 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 that the first one I bought was broken 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.140
 in a horrible way and I would like to know 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.900
 if you have a cube of these and if 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.670
 it's broken as well as leave me your 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 comments at the bottom and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.900
 tell me if I know if you have one of these 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.329
 cubes and if you have broken one because it was 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.490
 very sad do not think I like to buy 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.220
 two nothing more, just because 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.810
 I had one broke and I wanted to test if 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.510
 had been some factory defect or 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.850
 something then buy another one and this has 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.860
 come out very good at least I do not know 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.340
 broke the fifth sun I give turns 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.310
 Brutal brutal and still not broken 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.680
 we are going to dismantle it so that they see the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.410
 handsome design that has this cube I want 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.360
 that they see even here as the pieces 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.120
 they are arranged in a brilliant way 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.120
 so that the cube is concave a finish 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.250
 excellent and how you can notice the pieces 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.050
 they are crazy 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.780
 in fact I even feel weird to grab 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.130
 see them here in the high fucking 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.130
 definition as how this piece is 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.620
 as elongated it is a very very piece 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.740
 elongated compared to another edge and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.550
 nothing else looks like a torpedo 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:20.360
 It is a long elongated piece and see 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:24.440
 see this corner how it is designed very 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.590
 strangely not as long as 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.870
 as broad of the part of the base and 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.940
 it's weird it's weird but it's not 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.190
 they found another way obviously for 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.920
 design a more concave cube to do 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.840
 this weird design of the pieces there is 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.220
 metro I read the edge but in something that 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.100
 come back here is and see 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.450
 how is the fusion of the three pieces and 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.070
 that I also realize that I was 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.440
 thought for speed from a 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.630
 beginning from its manufacture but 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.640
 they effectively have a different finish 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.220
 see the edge completely different to 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.650
 the one of a 3 by 3 normal and obviously to 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.090
 the corner completely different from the 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.670
 of a 3 by 3 normal 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.030
 these pieces because without a doubt 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.410
 have amazed and I really like this cube 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.370
 despite the fact that the first one broke 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.960
 but its performance is very very good cube 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.090
 also in layer m without any 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.580
 inconvenient and its price is cheap 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.500
 you can buy this cube in speed tips 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.900
 mexico I leave the link in the part of the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.080
 description so you can buy it and 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.050
 You can check if it was a defect of 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.240
 factory or not the truth is that I stay 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.730
 with the half opinion because this cube 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.230
 It did not work out for me and this one 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.750
 broke the first time but hey 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.740
 I await your comments on the part 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.900
 below and well you liked this cube 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.390
 they like concave cubes if it's 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.520
 Ergonomic feels good to the touch and 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.969
 truth is that it turns pretty well for 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.669
 make a 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:55.829
 with such a crazy design that is our 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.739
 review of funk a three by three concave 

00:05:55.829 --> 00:06:00.819

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.779
 We are seeing in the following reviews 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.779
 up see it
