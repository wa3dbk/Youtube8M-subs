00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
operate the building when it's all done

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.250 
operate the building when it's all done
there<00:00:46.120> are<00:00:46.330> a<00:00:46.360> number<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.629> different<00:00:46.960> features

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
there are a number of different features

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.719 
there are a number of different features
in<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.470> building<00:00:47.799> that<00:00:47.920> don't<00:00:48.460> happen

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
in the building that don't happen

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.660 
in the building that don't happen
elsewhere<00:00:49.390> on<00:00:49.839> campus<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:51.070> collect<00:00:51.370> rainwater

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
elsewhere on campus we collect rainwater

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.049 
elsewhere on campus we collect rainwater
off<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.780> roof<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.250> collect<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.640> cistern

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
off the roof and collect it in a cistern

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.049 
off the roof and collect it in a cistern
that's<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:55.869> the<00:00:55.960> ground<00:00:56.369> underneath<00:00:57.369> near<00:00:57.909> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
that's in the ground underneath near the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's in the ground underneath near the
front<00:00:58.269> entrance<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.750> building<00:00:58.780> that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
front entrance of the building that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.619 
front entrance of the building that
rainwater<00:01:00.040> that's<00:01:00.699> collected<00:01:01.180> comes<00:01:01.420> back

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
rainwater that's collected comes back

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.570 
rainwater that's collected comes back
into<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.019> building<00:01:02.409> and<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:03.100> used<00:01:03.369> for

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
into the building and is used for

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.910 
into the building and is used for
flushing<00:01:03.820> toilets<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.780> urinals<00:01:04.920> throughout

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
flushing toilets and urinals throughout

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.510 
flushing toilets and urinals throughout
so<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.760> water<00:01:06.940> gets<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:07.210> second<00:01:07.570> use<00:01:07.750> on<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
so the water gets a second use on the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.289 
so the water gets a second use on the
roof<00:01:09.729> level<00:01:10.659> there<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.020> photovoltaic<00:01:11.799> cells

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
roof level there are photovoltaic cells

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.300 
roof level there are photovoltaic cells
photo<00:01:13.299> solar<00:01:13.719> cells<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.920> generate

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
photo solar cells that generate

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.190 
photo solar cells that generate
electricity<00:01:15.670> there's<00:01:16.119> also<00:01:16.329> a<00:01:16.539> wind<00:01:16.840> turbine

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
electricity there's also a wind turbine

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.499 
electricity there's also a wind turbine
that<00:01:17.710> generates<00:01:18.490> electricity<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.359> that

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
that generates electricity and that

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.020 
that generates electricity and that
comes<00:01:19.869> back<00:01:20.079> into<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.469> building<00:01:20.859> and<00:01:20.979> is<00:01:21.700> used

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
comes back into the building and is used

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.060 
comes back into the building and is used
under<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.810> right<00:01:22.960> conditions<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.710> turn<00:01:23.890> on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
under the right conditions to turn on

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.539 
under the right conditions to turn on
the<00:01:24.250> lights<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:24.670> corridors<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
the lights and the corridors also on the

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.139 
the lights and the corridors also on the
roof<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.630> green<00:01:29.020> roof<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:30.070> vegetated<00:01:30.700> planted

rainwater to help keep the area cool and
also<00:01:37.869> it's<00:01:38.710> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.950> be<00:01:39.009> used<00:01:39.189> for<00:01:39.280> research

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
also it's going to be used for research

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.550 
also it's going to be used for research
there's<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.240> lighting<00:01:40.630> control<00:01:40.780> system<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.499> the
