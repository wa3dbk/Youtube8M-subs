00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.520

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.390
 We will install it in place 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.390

 besides concise but also growing prince blooms 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.860
 white flowers are not so fast 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.180
 grow on camps but also 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.370
 frost resistant culture is great here 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.010
