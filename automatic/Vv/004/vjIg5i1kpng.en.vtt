00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.470 
this is another addendum to my min Naza
OSD<00:00:09.660> project<00:00:10.340> which<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.639> did<00:00:11.880> quite<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> while

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
OSD project which I did quite a while

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.220 
OSD project which I did quite a while
ago<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> probably<00:00:14.009> remember<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.519> had<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
ago now you probably remember I had the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.279 
ago now you probably remember I had the
minim<00:00:16.230> OSD<00:00:16.520> all<00:00:17.520> modified<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.080> could

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
minim OSD all modified so that I could

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.240 
minim OSD all modified so that I could
connect<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.310> Naza<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.090> light<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:22.250> an

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
connect it to the Naza and light as an

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
connect it to the Naza and light as an
OSD<00:00:23.820> since<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> nadzam<00:00:25.080> light<00:00:25.320> didn't<00:00:25.650> have

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
OSD since the nadzam light didn't have

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.540 
OSD since the nadzam light didn't have
an<00:00:25.949> OSD

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
an OSD

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.900 
an OSD
and<00:00:26.990> there<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.140> quite<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> trouble<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and there was quite a bit of trouble and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
and there was quite a bit of trouble and
soldering<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> wires<00:00:30.869> hooking

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
soldering all the wires hooking

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.130 
soldering all the wires hooking
everything<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:32.210> there's<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> wiki

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
everything up there's actually a wiki

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.709 
everything up there's actually a wiki
you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> schematic<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you can go to that has a schematic and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.479 
you can go to that has a schematic and
shows<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.530> how<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> connect<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> wires

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
shows you how to connect all the wires

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.389 
shows you how to connect all the wires
and<00:00:38.969> has<00:00:39.149> complete<00:00:39.540> instructions<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:41.160> it's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and has complete instructions but it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.900 
and has complete instructions but it's
quite<00:00:41.670> involved<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> display<00:00:44.550> I'm

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
quite involved I do like to display I'm

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
quite involved I do like to display I'm
still<00:00:45.180> using<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:45.870> quadcopter<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
still using it on my quadcopter and it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
still using it on my quadcopter and it
works<00:00:47.160> great<00:00:47.480> but<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.020> better

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
works great but there's a better

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.189 
works great but there's a better
solution<00:00:50.010> nowadays<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.510> found<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.989> on

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
solution nowadays and I found this on

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
solution nowadays and I found this on
the<00:00:52.350> internet<00:00:52.739> recently<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> may

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the internet recently some of you may

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.900 
the internet recently some of you may
already<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.399> actually

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
already know about it but it's actually

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.040 
already know about it but it's actually
called<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.660> s<00:00:58.440> OS<00:00:59.280> D<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.750> shown<00:01:01.020> right

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
called the s OS D which is shown right

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.140 
called the s OS D which is shown right
here<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.570> S<00:01:03.719> OSD<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.939> all<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
here and the S OSD has all the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
here and the S OSD has all the
connections<00:01:06.600> already<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:07.590> words

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
connections already on it in other words

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.300 
connections already on it in other words
it<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> men<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> project<00:01:10.040> already<00:01:11.040> done

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it is the men as a project already done

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
it is the men as a project already done
combined<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.390> board<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> basically

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
combined into one board so you basically

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
combined into one board so you basically
have<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.790> connections<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.390> need<00:01:15.600> right

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have all the connections you need right

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
have all the connections you need right
there<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.030> too<00:01:18.210> expensive<00:01:18.540> either

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
there and it's not too expensive either

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
there and it's not too expensive either
so<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.740> 40<00:01:20.189> bucks<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> all

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
so about 40 bucks you can have it all

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.679 
so about 40 bucks you can have it all
done<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.229> even<00:01:23.159> uses<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> same<00:01:23.850> code<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
done for you even uses the same code as

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.640 
done for you even uses the same code as
the<00:01:26.299> manasa<00:01:27.299> project<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.140> here's<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the manasa project and here's what the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
the manasa project and here's what the
display<00:01:28.979> looks<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:30.390> exactly<00:01:30.930> like

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
display looks like looks exactly like

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
display looks like looks exactly like
the<00:01:31.590> men<00:01:31.799> NASA<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.939> you've<00:01:33.240> used<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.780> NASA

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the men NASA if you've used them in NASA

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
the men NASA if you've used them in NASA
you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.680> looks<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you know what it looks like and so it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
you know what it looks like and so it
has<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> radar<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.290> all

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
has the radar right there and it has all

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.219 
has the radar right there and it has all
the<00:01:40.770> same<00:01:41.220> features<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.420> men<00:01:42.600> nezu<00:01:42.810> has

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the same features that the men nezu has

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.920 
the same features that the men nezu has
so<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.720> we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so this is a good way to go now so we

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.539 
so this is a good way to go now so we
really<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.350> need<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> men<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
really don't need to do the men as a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.539 
really don't need to do the men as a
project<00:01:47.850> anymore<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> few<00:01:49.920> bucks<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
project anymore it's only a few bucks so

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
project anymore it's only a few bucks so
there<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.180> here's<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> connections

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
there you go here's all the connections

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.840 
there you go here's all the connections

cheaper<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:11.819> here's<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> plugs<00:02:12.599> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
cheaper so here's how it plugs in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.390 
cheaper so here's how it plugs in
so<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:14.780> GPS<00:02:15.780> from<00:02:15.990> your<00:02:16.260> NASA<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.190> can

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so your GPS from your NASA and this can

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.490 
so your GPS from your NASA and this can
be<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> NASA<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.090> light<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.870> works<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.290> any

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
be a NASA in light really works with any

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.520 
be a NASA in light really works with any
of<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> NASA's<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.670> your<00:02:20.900> GPS<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.260> plug

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
of the NASA's but your GPS can plug

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.910 
of the NASA's but your GPS can plug
right<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> unit<00:02:24.240> right<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> then

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
right in to the unit right here and then

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.440 
right in to the unit right here and then
there's<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.220> cable<00:02:26.460> that's<00:02:26.790> provided<00:02:27.360> that
