we<00:01:08.000> can<00:01:08.150> see<00:01:08.299> Lily's<00:01:08.780> minimalistic<00:01:09.320> design

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
we can see Lily's minimalistic design

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.090 
we can see Lily's minimalistic design
but<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.430> very<00:01:10.610> interesting<00:01:11.140> curved<00:01:12.140> shape

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.279 

now<00:01:16.100> let's<00:01:16.340> take<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.490> look<00:01:16.729> inside<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.299> PC<00:01:17.689> q30

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
now let's take a look inside the PC q30

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.740 
now let's take a look inside the PC q30
to<00:01:18.920> do<00:01:19.039> so<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.429> just<00:01:19.670> take<00:01:19.850> out<00:01:19.969> four<00:01:20.329> screws

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
to do so you just take out four screws

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.440 
to do so you just take out four screws
two<00:01:21.530> right<00:01:21.770> here<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.280> two<00:01:22.729> right<00:01:22.909> here<00:01:23.240> and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
two right here and two right here and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.529 
two right here and two right here and
then<00:01:24.140> simply<00:01:24.549> pull<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.270> off<00:01:26.570> like<00:01:27.020> so

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
then simply pull this off like so

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.539 
then simply pull this off like so
looking<00:01:29.539> inside<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.049> PC<00:01:30.409> q30<00:01:30.890> first<00:01:31.189> we<00:01:31.399> see

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
looking inside the PC q30 first we see

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.239 
looking inside the PC q30 first we see
our<00:01:31.729> 140<00:01:32.390> millimeter<00:01:32.780> outtake<00:01:33.259> fancy<00:01:33.740> sitting

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
our 140 millimeter outtake fancy sitting

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:35.859 
our 140 millimeter outtake fancy sitting
right<00:01:34.369> here<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.299> blowing<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.689> hot

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
right here and that is blowing the hot

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.499 
right here and that is blowing the hot
air<00:01:36.079> out<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.679> case<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.219> top<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.299> is

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
air out of the case on top of that is

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.419 
air out of the case on top of that is
where<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:38.960> mini<00:01:39.200> ITX<00:01:39.409> motherboard<00:01:39.740> would<00:01:40.219> sit

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
where the mini ITX motherboard would sit

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.620 
where the mini ITX motherboard would sit
and<00:01:40.520> there<00:01:40.640> are<00:01:40.819> four<00:01:41.179> there<00:01:41.479> are<00:01:41.509> four

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and there are four there are four

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.289 
and there are four there are four

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
pre-installed standoffs the graphics

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.300 
pre-installed standoffs the graphics
card<00:01:44.509> would<00:01:44.689> come<00:01:44.899> down<00:01:45.079> like<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:46.100> way

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
card would come down like so that way

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.819 
card would come down like so that way
it's<00:01:46.609> with<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.569> window<00:01:47.840> right<00:01:48.079> here<00:01:48.109> you
