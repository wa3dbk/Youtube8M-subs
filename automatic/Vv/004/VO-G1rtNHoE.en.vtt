00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.400
 twenty-four hours after the last but one 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 friendly the judgment changes improves 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.639
 on the performance of the team that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.850
 interview I didn't want to see in the meantime 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.250
 the inter floor has a different height like 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.949
 a different warm good does different and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.510
 so I knew we did it 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.510
 affixed that when you go down the level 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 the sea is now very close to the sea 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 the warmer there is the less less oxygen then 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.809
 let it be more difficult, and therefore from this 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.330
 point of view we expected and of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 like a little slower loads of 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.780
 work have been well absorbed and 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 once the preparation is over, this tells 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.470
 in the best way the team has 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.510
 responded well to all he suffered loads 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.710
 of work and this then was what 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 we wanted 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.220
 the impression that clearly in this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.769
 phase some player that goes a little more 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.970
 fast that got better too 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.650
 tactically what your ideas are 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.540
 some even physically is a bit more 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.100
 back when you think in the times of 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
 being able to put on the same level 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.110
 then that team that said no 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 very right situation, however, is part 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.040
 a little we experts know that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 so there is what absorbs the best 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 preparation and short ago first 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 get into the heaviest shape there 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 puts a little more but that's all in 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 line with what we wanted and that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.040
 that we went to look up to this 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 moment but do not like to talk about one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520
 I want to ask a young man and he must do 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.799
 icardi experience of the attackers is 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.690
 the one who has to work even more 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.980
 to understand certain things they had of those 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.810
 who made more effort did the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 text was one of those that will have more 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 need to work had less autonomy 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.380
 on endurance and power 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.080
 aerobics, however, has committed to repeating ha 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.340
 worked so hard on the field is still a 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200
 little back to from a point of view 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.940
 just the condition of the movement 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 were pleased with the compliments of 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.450
 in short, moratti said it's a lot 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.750
 happy with what he saw in 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.190
 these days this week of work 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.580
 if when the president talks like that he does 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.040
 always pleasure would have served also for 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.460
 to understand who could live up to it 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.460
 for example 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.219
 the budget then I said now to have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.810
 those these indications of which me 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.540
 talk you have to wait a little longer 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.459
 because it will come to say to have 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140
 precise indications and technical tactics 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.689
 you have to be comfortable with your legs i 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.239
 guys are packed directions 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.340
 relates the comforting data in 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.799
 everyone wants to sacrifice 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.250
 spirit great spirit of sacrifice e 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.920
 work 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.889
 everyone wants to do well not give up 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.689
 maximum endurance to fatigue e 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.120
 this is the thing we were repeating 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.010
 looking and given more comforting and that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.519
 then at this time of the year 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 need more yes but now we do n't say it 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.159
 more we think now there are two days then 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.159
 you go to play 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.220
 It returns to work on these things 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.590
 the company will talk about it now 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.419
 I just want to value trying to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.859
 work best in this 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.209
 time of year with the players I have 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.950
 available to a team well 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.669
 organized and behaved well 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.169
 against against they pulled out 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.030
 the best, in short, were beautiful 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.150
 organized compacts are a good one 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.150
 team 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.680
 Of course, I always want everything 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.840
 the coach always hopes to have everyone 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.490
 available kovacic is a boy 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.540
 interesting as we all know not 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.610
 it was going great 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:42.180
 this incident of path there are 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:43.620
 we expect football in government 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.680
 final minutes 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.100
 the games must be evaluated in another way 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.750
 there are spaces in the final game 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.570
 of these friendly in this heat is 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.570
 different, however, increasing opening 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.910
 that we were not both 4 we were also 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.620
 the first time then maybe we attacked a 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.540
 the more we got up, the less we noticed 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.400
 however it is certain I do 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.590
 evaluations I also did in Naples 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 gesa 4 done so many things sometimes someone 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.459
 does not notice he did not notice how 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 I did the inter channel test a
