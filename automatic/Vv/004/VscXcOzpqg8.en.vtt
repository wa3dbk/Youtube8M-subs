00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.119
 English cable because I already defend myself like this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.119

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.500
 primary school they enjoyed disparaging 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 tip of bullying 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.920
 Traumatized by day 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.570
 Grandpa, you know I would bite him 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.960
 Imagine that your little friend Louis kicks a 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.440
 ball and hits goal grandpa but if you 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.670

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.680
 [Music] 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 studies like shrimp with sauce 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.740
 spicy and then an ice cream gives you diarrhea 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.810
 Of course 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.430
 because God's voice is not bent by 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.160
 morgan freeman is not so good if morgan 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.450
 freeman read the coelho books in 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.040
 loudly they would still be bad because 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.620
 you do not stop public food 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.860

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.410

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.230
 to fuck everyone ignores me the animation 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.519
 the script is good even the problem 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.519

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.640

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.470

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.530
 life of bullshit and blows the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.530
 breathalyser 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.760
 because they do not make a show of hate 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.010
 tweets because I do not have time I'm 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.800
 working someone has to take out the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.930
 country forward with so much hippie government 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.930
 stupid goodbye 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.250
 and what he wants to say is that here is 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.799
 a very important character and we are going to 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.920
 keep accompanying more often with your 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.400
 very black humor certain girls no no no 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.900
 not what I understood was yesterday good I 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.220
 I think we left everything for today though 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.200
 there were many unanswered questions 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 but but if you win and not the over the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.280
 game about us for a future 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.409
 video but what I understood where that 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.479
 although we never say it is very 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.729
 important is a nice up in the 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.859
 video if you liked it and write the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.810
 managers what topic do you want us to talk about in 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.610
 a future tell me but what I understood from 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.770
 I hate my study is that they do not want jose 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.370
 because you always have to do this 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.140
 I already said it but he does not want to I said it 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.710
