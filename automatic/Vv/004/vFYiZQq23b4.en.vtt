imagine

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.170 

and<00:01:57.230> that's<00:01:57.380> how<00:01:57.500> good<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.980> guides<00:01:58.640> are<00:01:58.970> like

and that's how good the guides are like
we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.480> see<00:01:59.660> like<00:01:59.960> our<00:02:00.140> conceive<00:02:00.440> is<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> blur

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
we can see like our conceive is a blur

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.010 
we can see like our conceive is a blur
or<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.370> dark<00:02:01.670> green<00:02:01.880> shape<00:02:02.180> English<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:02.930> can

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
or a dark green shape English you can

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.420 
or a dark green shape English you can
actually<00:02:03.140> see<00:02:03.530> them<00:02:03.800> when<00:02:03.920> they<00:02:04.040> tilt<00:02:04.370> their

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
actually see them when they tilt their

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.490 
actually see them when they tilt their
body<00:02:04.730> doing<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.180> fly<00:02:05.420> fish<00:02:06.080> on

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.139 

and<00:02:08.950> still<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> lot<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.430> learn<00:02:09.550> with<00:02:09.850> his<00:02:09.940> bias

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
and still a lot to learn with his bias

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:40.830 
and still a lot to learn with his bias
mission<00:02:10.479> but<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:10.899> something<00:02:11.230> just

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.920 

but<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.170> crab<00:02:42.799> pattern<00:02:43.159> that<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:44.510> go

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
but on that crab pattern that we just go

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.640 
but on that crab pattern that we just go
to<00:02:45.140> twisting<00:02:45.590> our<00:02:45.799> English<00:02:46.280> said<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.650> my

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
to twisting our English said that my

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.759 
to twisting our English said that my
first<00:02:48.859> initial<00:02:49.250> skip<00:02:49.760> was<00:02:49.939> too<00:02:50.150> long<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:51.319> you

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
first initial skip was too long and you

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.339 
first initial skip was too long and you
had<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> keep<00:02:52.129> it<00:02:52.250> short<00:02:52.549> short<00:02:53.060> short<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.780> guess

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
had to keep it short short short I guess

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.149 
had to keep it short short short I guess
that's<00:02:54.560> how<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.739> crab<00:02:55.040> moves<00:02:55.599> but<00:02:57.159> certainly

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
that's how a crab moves but certainly

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:13.870 
that's how a crab moves but certainly
good<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.579> keep<00:02:58.879> a<00:02:59.000> low<00:02:59.150> profile

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:28.350 

so<00:03:14.360> that's<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.010> second<00:03:16.010> run

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.149 

this<00:03:29.360> fish<00:03:29.540> was<00:03:29.750> tailing<00:03:30.049> from<00:03:30.439> about<00:03:30.680> 90<00:03:31.129> feet

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
this fish was tailing from about 90 feet

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.229 
this fish was tailing from about 90 feet
away<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.680> but<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> conditions<00:03:34.819> we<00:03:35.000> kept

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
away and but with the conditions we kept

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.670 
away and but with the conditions we kept
losing<00:03:35.390> him<00:03:35.689> losing<00:03:35.930> him<00:03:36.140> but<00:03:36.290> English

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
losing him losing him but English

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.880 
losing him losing him but English
assured<00:03:37.069> me<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.610> steady<00:03:38.540> steps<00:03:39.019> just<00:03:39.709> be

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
assured me just the steady steps just be

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.940 
assured me just the steady steps just be
patient<00:03:40.400> keep<00:03:40.579> a<00:03:40.730> low<00:03:40.879> profile<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.950> crab

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
patient keep a low profile and crab

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:56.750 
patient keep a low profile and crab
pattern<00:03:43.310> did<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> trick

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.460 

when<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.360> did<00:03:57.510> come<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:57.750> Christmas<00:03:57.959> all<00:03:58.260> and

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
when you did come to Christmas all and

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.560 
when you did come to Christmas all and
you<00:03:58.530> will<00:03:58.650> make<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.860> selection<00:03:59.190> of

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
you will make a selection of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.320 
you will make a selection of
what<00:04:01.350> works<00:04:01.710> on<00:04:01.950> one<00:04:02.130> flat<00:04:02.460> or<00:04:02.700> even<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:03.180> one

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
what works on one flat or even for one

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.510 
what works on one flat or even for one
pot<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.630> fish<00:04:03.870> won't<00:04:04.380> work<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.770> another<00:04:04.980> one<00:04:05.280> so

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
pot of fish won't work on another one so

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.910 
pot of fish won't work on another one so
you<00:04:05.580> need<00:04:05.900> variations<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.020> color<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.590> weights

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you need variations in color and weights

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.310 
you need variations in color and weights
as<00:04:08.190> well<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.300> mean<00:04:09.660> that's<00:04:09.750> something<00:04:10.020> that

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
as well so I mean that's something that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.490 
as well so I mean that's something that
we<00:04:10.680> used<00:04:11.010> over<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.610> course<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.120> few<00:04:12.330> days

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
we used over the course of a few days

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.260 
we used over the course of a few days
just<00:04:13.500> different<00:04:13.860> colors<00:04:14.370> go<00:04:14.670> from<00:04:14.910> orange

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
just different colors go from orange

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.240 
just different colors go from orange
which<00:04:15.480> might<00:04:15.660> work<00:04:15.840> perfectly

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
which might work perfectly

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.740 
which might work perfectly
you<00:04:17.489> know<00:04:17.549> onto<00:04:17.850> silver<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.480> then<00:04:18.570> there's

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
you know onto silver and then there's

these for trevally something nice big

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.689 
these for trevally something nice big
fleshy<00:04:37.879> profile<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:40.069> something<00:04:40.550> really

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
fleshy profile and it's something really

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.249

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
going to attract some attention you

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.409 
going to attract some attention you
create<00:04:42.620> them<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:43.069> to<00:04:43.460> strike<00:04:43.759> in<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:44.360> you

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
create them to to strike in it so you

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.659 
create them to to strike in it so you
have<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.960> good<00:04:45.110> selection<00:04:45.349> of<00:04:45.650> flies<00:04:45.860> you're

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
have a good selection of flies you're

00:04:46.669 --> 00:05:06.770 
have a good selection of flies you're
going<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.849> catch<00:04:47.000> as<00:04:47.120> many<00:04:47.150> fish

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.200 

so<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:08.070> tend<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.340> use<00:05:08.430> like<00:05:08.700> an<00:05:08.820> eighth<00:05:08.970> weight

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
so we tend to use like an eighth weight

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.540 
so we tend to use like an eighth weight
something<00:05:09.660> with<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> bit<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.740> power<00:05:11.160> because

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
something with a bit of power because

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.790 
something with a bit of power because
you<00:05:11.790> can<00:05:11.940> quite<00:05:12.180> often<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> bit<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.560> wind

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
you can quite often have a bit of wind

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.100 
you can quite often have a bit of wind
as<00:05:14.040> well<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.520> we've<00:05:15.180> got<00:05:15.330> an<00:05:15.480> 8<00:05:15.600> weight<00:05:15.840> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
as well so we've got an 8 weight and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.960 
as well so we've got an 8 weight and
like<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> decent<00:05:17.040> wheels<00:05:17.370> could<00:05:17.610> be<00:05:17.730> a<00:05:17.760> good

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
like a decent wheels could be a good

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.090 
like a decent wheels could be a good
waterproof<00:05:18.300> tray<00:05:18.750> because<00:05:19.380> they<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.680> give<00:05:19.980> it

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
waterproof tray because they do give it

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.130 
waterproof tray because they do give it
a<00:05:20.160> workout<00:05:20.580> we<00:05:21.120> also<00:05:21.270> tend<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.690> use<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.900> lot<00:05:22.080> of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
a workout we also tend to use a lot of

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.990 
a workout we also tend to use a lot of
things<00:05:22.440> like<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.920> to<00:05:23.310> protect<00:05:23.670> against

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
things like a to protect against

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.050 
things like a to protect against
the<00:05:24.120> Sun<00:05:24.590> decent<00:05:25.590> set<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.770> glasses<00:05:26.040> we<00:05:26.490> quite

the Sun decent set of glasses we quite

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.000 
the Sun decent set of glasses we quite
often<00:05:27.180> used<00:05:27.360> like<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.750> Makos<00:05:28.170> and<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:28.710> find

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
often used like the Makos and I find

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.710 
often used like the Makos and I find
like<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.610> trout<00:05:29.940> lens<00:05:30.180> which<00:05:30.420> is<00:05:30.540> like

like the the trout lens which is like

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.570 
like the the trout lens which is like
brown<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.320> probably<00:05:31.560> one<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.860> best<00:05:32.070> to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
brown is probably one of the best to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.910 
brown is probably one of the best to
highlight<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.090> bone<00:05:33.300> fish<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:34.410> quite<00:05:34.740> often
