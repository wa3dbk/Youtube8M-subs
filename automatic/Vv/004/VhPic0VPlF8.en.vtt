fairly okay a beer taste would give

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.280 
fairly okay a beer taste would give
results<00:01:42.830> that<00:01:43.010> are<00:01:43.250> almost<00:01:43.700> always<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:45.080> same

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
results that are almost always the same

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.999 
results that are almost always the same
each<00:01:45.650> time<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.580> first<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.570> all<00:01:48.009> we

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
each time you do it first of all we

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.280 
each time you do it first of all we
could<00:01:49.160> find<00:01:49.430> some<00:01:49.729> weed<00:01:49.940> outside<00:01:50.150> where<00:01:51.140> there

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
could find some weed outside where there

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.890 
could find some weed outside where there
were<00:01:51.350> lots<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.920> replace<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.880> both<00:01:53.300> dark<00:01:53.690> and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
were lots of replace in both dark and

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.920 
were lots of replace in both dark and
late<00:01:54.650> places<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.520> could<00:01:55.670> have<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.240> little

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
late places and we could have a little

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.410 
late places and we could have a little
look<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.409> see<00:01:57.979> if<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.250> could<00:01:58.430> count<00:01:58.700> how<00:01:59.360> many

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
look and see if we could count how many

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.900 
look and see if we could count how many
