develop<00:05:54.060> as<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.720> only<00:05:55.140> way<00:05:55.290> that<00:05:55.320> can

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
develop as and the only way that can

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.540 
develop as and the only way that can
happen<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.900> if<00:05:57.900> Jordy<00:05:58.530> Nelson<00:05:58.919> continues<00:05:59.430> to

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
happen is if Jordy Nelson continues to

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.880 
happen is if Jordy Nelson continues to
play<00:05:59.700> flanker<00:06:00.270> as<00:06:00.450> he's<00:06:00.810> been<00:06:01.020> playing<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.560> so

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
play flanker as he's been playing it so

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.690 
play flanker as he's been playing it so
very<00:06:02.430> well<00:06:02.669> I<00:06:02.700> might<00:06:02.970> add<00:06:03.180> as<00:06:03.570> we<00:06:03.750> all<00:06:03.870> know<00:06:04.050> and

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
very well I might add as we all know and

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.640 
very well I might add as we all know and
they<00:06:05.700> install<00:06:06.180> Jeff<00:06:06.570> jannett<00:06:07.080> as<00:06:07.260> the

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
they install Jeff jannett as the

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.200 
they install Jeff jannett as the
starting<00:06:08.220> split<00:06:08.790> end

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
starting split end

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.600 
starting split end
so<00:06:09.480> in<00:06:09.630> pre<00:06:09.840> receiver<00:06:10.200> sets<00:06:10.530> you've<00:06:11.100> got<00:06:11.310> Jeff

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
so in pre receiver sets you've got Jeff

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.830 
so in pre receiver sets you've got Jeff
Janis<00:06:12.030> out<00:06:12.240> wide

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840

you've<00:06:13.470> got<00:06:15.320> Jordy<00:06:16.320> Nelson<00:06:16.770> playing<00:06:17.130> a<00:06:17.220> couple

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
you've got Jordy Nelson playing a couple

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.159 
you've got Jordy Nelson playing a couple

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
of yards off the line of scrimmage at

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.140 
of yards off the line of scrimmage at
flanker<00:06:19.620> and<00:06:19.770> then<00:06:20.370> you've<00:06:20.490> got<00:06:20.669> Randall<00:06:20.970> Cobb

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
flanker and then you've got Randall Cobb

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.990 
flanker and then you've got Randall Cobb
in<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.390> slot<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:22.140> is<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.500> ideal
