I'm<00:00:00.240> senior<00:00:00.750> with<00:00:01.020> GigaOM<00:00:01.319> and<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:01.740> here

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I'm senior with GigaOM and I'm here

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.820 
I'm senior with GigaOM and I'm here
today<00:00:02.310> with<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.970> phantom<00:00:03.449> 2<00:00:03.659> vision<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.620> a

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.230 
today with the phantom 2 vision it's a
remote-controlled<00:00:05.160> quadcopter<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.120> has<00:00:06.210> a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240

so this is the phantom 2 vision it's a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
so this is the phantom 2 vision it's a
quadcopter<00:00:11.910> that's<00:00:12.420> available<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.840> for
