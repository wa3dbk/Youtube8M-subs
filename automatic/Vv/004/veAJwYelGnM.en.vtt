the great things about this is the size

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.640 
the great things about this is the size
of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.460> receiver<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.630> small<00:00:18.960> enough<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.380> fit

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
of the receiver it's small enough to fit

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
this video is on how to operate this

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
this video is on how to operate this
thing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
thing

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.970 
thing
so<00:00:35.680> let's<00:00:35.920> start<00:00:36.220> by<00:00:36.550> turning<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.030> collar<00:00:37.270> on

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so let's start by turning the collar on

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.740 
so let's start by turning the collar on
when<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.100> look<00:00:39.280> at<00:00:39.400> both<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.760> collar<00:00:40.000> as<00:00:40.270> well

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
when you look at both the collar as well

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.080 
when you look at both the collar as well
as<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.050> back<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.559> transmitter<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.340> will

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
as the back of the transmitter you will

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.590 
as the back of the transmitter you will
notice<00:00:43.420> they<00:00:43.720> both<00:00:43.750> have<00:00:44.200> a<00:00:44.230> small<00:00:44.650> red<00:00:45.160> dot

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
notice they both have a small red dot

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320 
notice they both have a small red dot
this<00:00:46.600> dot<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:47.230> actually<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.040> magnetic<00:00:48.760> on/off

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
this dot is actually a magnetic on/off

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.580 
this dot is actually a magnetic on/off
switch<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:50.530> simply<00:00:50.890> hold<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.280> two<00:00:51.519> together

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
switch you simply hold the two together

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.079 
switch you simply hold the two together
and<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:55.809> for<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.080> green<00:00:56.350> light<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.760> tell<00:00:57.940> it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
and look for the green light to tell it

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.079 
and look for the green light to tell it
it's<00:00:58.210> on<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.680> red<00:00:59.680> light<00:00:59.920> indicates<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.940> it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
it's on a red light indicates that it's

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:09.300 
it's on a red light indicates that it's
turning<00:01:01.449> off<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> collar<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.130> on

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
turning off now that the collar is on

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.420 
turning off now that the collar is on
let's<00:01:09.850> go<00:01:10.060> over<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.330> transmitter<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.159> said

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
let's go over the transmitter as I said

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.899 
let's go over the transmitter as I said
the<00:01:12.760> IQ<00:01:13.299> is<00:01:13.560> extremely<00:01:14.560> simple<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.250> operate

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
the IQ is extremely simple to operate

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.840 
the IQ is extremely simple to operate
you<00:01:16.780> start<00:01:17.110> by<00:01:17.799> adjusting<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.460> level<00:01:18.760> of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
you start by adjusting the level of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.670 
you start by adjusting the level of
stimulation<00:01:19.150> with<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.840> dial<00:01:20.140> on<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.650> top

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
stimulation with the dial on the top

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.710 
stimulation with the dial on the top
corner<00:01:23.189> simply<00:01:24.189> turn<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.549> dial<00:01:24.580> from<00:01:25.299> zero

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
corner simply turn the dial from zero

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.600 
corner simply turn the dial from zero
which<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.830> off<00:01:26.950> position

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
which is the off position

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.320 
which is the off position
all<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.510> way<00:01:28.600> up<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.869> 100<00:01:29.400> most<00:01:30.400> dogs<00:01:30.729> feel<00:01:31.180> the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
all the way up to 100 most dogs feel the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.100 
all the way up to 100 most dogs feel the
stimulation<00:01:31.780> around<00:01:32.170> 20<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.360> three<00:01:34.689> buttons

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
stimulation around 20 the three buttons

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.919 
stimulation around 20 the three buttons
on<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.950> front<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.369> collar<00:01:36.609> are<00:01:36.939> also<00:01:37.539> very
