wallet thing I really like about this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
wallet thing I really like about this
for<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.840> size<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.680> super<00:01:29.310> bulky

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
for one is the size it's not super bulky

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
for one is the size it's not super bulky
but<00:01:30.240> still<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> provide<00:01:30.990> good

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but still going to provide good

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
but still going to provide good
protection<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> snap-on<00:01:32.610> case<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.180> just

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that I would recommend about this case

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.700 
that I would recommend about this case
over<00:02:12.330> maybe<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> hex<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.380> slightly

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
over maybe the hex is it is slightly

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
over maybe the hex is it is slightly
more<00:02:14.010> protective<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.120> being<00:02:15.390> said<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.720> is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
more protective that being said it is

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
more protective that being said it is
going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:16.980> bulky<00:02:17.490> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
going to be a little bit more bulky so

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.950 
going to be a little bit more bulky so
it<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.030> really<00:02:18.180> depends<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:18.810> you're

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960

that genuine leather has rather than

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.230 
that genuine leather has rather than
kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.860> fake<00:03:35.100> leather<00:03:35.460> material<00:03:36.090> out

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
soft rubber material with hard plastic

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.710 
soft rubber material with hard plastic
exterior<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.790> slip<00:04:18.090> credit<00:04:18.510> card

so<00:04:18.960> here<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.260> three<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.520> slip

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
so here I have three you can just slip

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.150 
so here I have three you can just slip
those<00:04:21.030> stack<00:04:21.690> behind<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.260> plastic<00:04:23.010> will

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
those stack behind this plastic will

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.470 
those stack behind this plastic will
flex<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.580> little<00:04:23.610> bit<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.180> can

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
flex a little bit so you can

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360 
flex a little bit so you can
quite<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> few<00:04:25.050> credit<00:04:25.380> cards<00:04:25.410> in<00:04:25.770> there<00:04:25.950> but

quite a few credit cards in there but

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.890 
quite a few credit cards in there but
even<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.790> have<00:04:26.940> one<00:04:27.150> it'll<00:04:27.450> stay<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:27.720> there

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
even if you have one it'll stay in there

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.750 
even if you have one it'll stay in there
nicely<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.920> remove<00:04:29.190> them<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.580> just

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
nicely and then to remove them you just

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.670 
nicely and then to remove them you just
stick<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.000> through<00:04:30.330> with<00:04:30.540> your<00:04:30.690> thumb<00:04:30.930> only

problem with this is you're going to be

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.850 
problem with this is you're going to be
adding<00:04:33.120> quite<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> bit<00:04:33.900> more<00:04:34.080> bulk<00:04:34.380> than<00:04:34.680> say

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
adding quite a bit more bulk than say

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.580
