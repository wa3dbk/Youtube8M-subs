00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 when there is no believe that this fight between 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.470
 the canelo álvarez and miguel cotto finish 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.150
 by way of the nocout look everything can 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 pass over the school we know that 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 this fight for the level of both 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 fighters can go maybe to the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 decision but the two have stuck the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 two have power in the fists and both 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 they have combinations of long punches 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.609
 so why not say it like that if you can 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 end up on the way of the nocout who knows 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.760
 what side do they want who is who 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.109
 he knows he's going to be raised 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.240
 hand but you can end up by the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 nocout pathway may be feasible as 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 we see so evenly everyone that can 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 pass anything knockout points 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 victory for one side for the other in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
 end very very even so bets 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 are closed we go with the second 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.480
 question with punch for juan manuel 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 marquez juan in this same tenor that if 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.879
 comes to win the canelo álvarez that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.860
 represents for his career for the brief 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 legacy that has for the moment that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.550
 represents for the sauna race 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.500
 the power will be an important factor 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 win because we know that the cinnamon 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 Álvarez needs credibility and this one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.629
 would give him an important step to have him 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.090
 the credibility that a lot 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.189
 in our country and possibly not to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.560
 our country is asking you then 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.240
 it is a factor and an important point to be able 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.799
 the granada miguel cotto and see what 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.140
 way you can do it also because it is 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.610
 can go exactly is a way 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.039
 convincing because maybe I could 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.570
 decision and a decision in which 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.280
 be favorable to the canelo and be the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.439
 can give may be several factors 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.569
 but here the important thing is to beat him and that 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.090
 have the credibility you need to 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.619
 can already have large and large 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.600
 fights that aspire to great rivals 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.140
 I would obviously move 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.819
 race to another is the level but let's go 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.399
 with the last question with punches already 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.020
 we know what the plans are and fill 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.599
 I say what who is facing David Lemieux 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.539
 Miguel Cotto at Canelo Alvarez 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.610
 winners face them in 2016 these are 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.289
 the plans for that to happen then it's 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 different we have an obligation 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.270
 to ask Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.369
 one of these two cane preserve would have 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200
 opportunity to beat Ghana I say the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.030
 optimal is not so was a question with 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.489
 consolation companys 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.840
 Well, you have the opportunity, we know that 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.799
 they both have very good technique of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.660
 boxing with the two are very good 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.260
 fighters have combinations of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.120
 hits 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220
 very well the waist with what has its 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 strong creator a very frontal fighter 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.060
 maybe in some mechanical episodes in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.159
 which may open the opportunity 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.680
 any of the two or victor 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.170
 be it canelo álvarez or miguel cotto 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 to be able to throw water combinations 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.769
 if they can not stand the power they can not stand the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.780
 push can not stand the goal pressure or 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.239
 well that your employer who always exercises 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.040
 pressure round after round and we know that 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.750
 the physical background of both Miguel Cotto 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.940
 as of canelo álvarez is not the best 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.470
 then that is an important factor 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.079
 but the two either of the two that 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.489
 that came to win this fight I think 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.530
 that will be very good rivals for goal or 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.120
 is that boxing must be understood from 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.099
 round trip to juana 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.530
 I'm going to offend, I'm going to connect but 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.569
 they will also give me to give every action 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.639
 there is a reaction then you have to 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.230
 be very aware as soon as you 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.120
 you already have the answer comes from your opponent 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.099
 and we know what goal you get is a 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.079
 fighter who likes to be very aggressive 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.909
 who likes to attack who likes 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.530
 press but you have to see also 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.480
 if he likes to be hit if he likes 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.069
 that they are also pulling you and each 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.049
 time he pulls combinations of 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.060
 blows kickback not just with 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.550
 one but with several bots 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.730
 colo who is a very tough fighter and 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.580
 as all of them should resent style 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.680
 elusive left-handed mobility at school 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.200
 American thanks to Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.620
 this was the questions section with 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.620
 punch
