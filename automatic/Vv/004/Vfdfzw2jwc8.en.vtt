00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.850
 I will now 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.860
 very rapid transposition of soil and 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.720
 harmony transposition 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.330
 We're going to have to carry all this. 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 at the same time trying to explain each one 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.830
 but you'll have to process both 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.390
 simultaneously or teach how the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.400
 first thing you have to take in 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.680
 mind is harmony is the sound of chords 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.740
 I'm going to use the song waiting on the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.140
 window as an example is here will be 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.160
 the national chord to vote for the tonality of 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 pha to the chord that we're going to start is the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:54.149
 own fa 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.309
 the paraná does not abandon the amaro family 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.879
 the chords that happened here was the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.180
 next will make bigger only the smallest and the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.160
 The dodo is the fifth degree of the sun. 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.330
 high school and is within the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:15.860
 higher harmonic field if the degree is 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.860
 125 The Music Ground 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.030
 just this example here 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 Let's imagine that you have to carry 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.630
 This song for me has to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.730
 half tone only in an hour what 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:54.200
 Do you go or carry harmony 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:55.100
 quickly remembering that in the field 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.380
 greater harmonic 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 my greater peace even smaller or if it is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.040
 greater that is 125 of the harmonic field 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.260
 bigger 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.450
 now let's carry the ground let's go 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.080
 pass a series of agreements with four 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.970
 probe that has four sounds 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 it is called tetra of up to 30 days 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.900
 simple is a trail of one more note 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.930
 adding'll go to you the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.470
 12 major chords with 7th minor 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.190
 his training will be as follows 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 to be two-tone papa second to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.020
 note 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.180
 but arrive at me 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:47.280
 with tone and medium will stay in the sun and the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 seventh minor always half-tone before 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.160
 seventh largest 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.430
 here is the 7th minor C's too 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 a practical sect to locate you 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 seventh is to play a tone below the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.820
 octave or the seventh or half tone below the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.000
 7th largest any larger scale 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.480
 in case you are here you will always keep 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 the largest trail that is the pity in sun and 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.750
 will always add a tone adopts a 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.460
 tone down the octave or half tone below 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.310
 of the 7th largest scale 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:30.330
 the typing package with four sounds is 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:38.000
 has 22 very well used pattern is 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:41.940
 11 235 at the tip or 12 45 at the tip is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.620
 I also give it to you with the exception of these 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.730
 two chords you can use one two three 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.010
 four five 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.550
 one two three four and the fact also 1234 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.780
 I will now pass the 12 to larger cuts 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.380
 with seventh minor 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.730
 Good, I'll tell you now. 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.680
 cliché is specific applied or change ne 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.930
 you can get a cliché to use 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.750
 another style if it looks nice can 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.570
 use but I want to target these 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.880
 cliches for change and more style 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.200
 Guarani this style more mellow 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.660
 dragged to and I will pass five patterns 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.560
 These are cliches that I'll pass on to you. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.350
 now explaining that it is cliche cliché 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.770
 one sentence ready one sentence already programmed 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.080
 has created this set gives us here 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.000
 call cliche is in some meters 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 American you will find there written 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.780
 in rif Christians to the clichés also ne 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.979
 The first cliché I'm going to pass on. 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.830
 You're a cliche, it's too much used. 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.500
 known 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.270
 You certainly heard this first one. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.020
 Excerpt I'm going to do now 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.270
 The example I'm going to use is the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.700
 cliché and nah henry but you can 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.500
 transport to other shades're 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.390
 To save time, I 'll teach you. 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.100
 how to make the cliché I'll give a 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.040
 For example, you can do me 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.200
 Do you just get at home you have to win 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.740
 time here we go there the first cliché is 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.670
 This is the design of a larger arpeggio, right? 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.010
 Eighth given is this cliché you can 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.240
 apply the moment you think 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.080
 should apply a hint already in the song 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.270
 use that in the music lets you use it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.880
 these cliches sentences at the time 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.640
 in the pause of the voice the singer is singing 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.790
 what is made of those kisses that I give you 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.790
 I gave 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:52.120
 I see that I have given you 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:56.520
 ah ah ah ah these cliches take well in 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.520
 peace speech pauses 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.940
 an and min 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.890
 The Pope told me to come back. 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 now 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.930
 out 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.860
 is 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.090
 not 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.090
 O
