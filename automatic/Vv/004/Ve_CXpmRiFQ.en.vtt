see often in these toy lines as far as

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.520 
see often in these toy lines as far as
the<00:00:38.309> mold<00:00:38.580> goes<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.260> good

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the mold goes it's actually pretty good

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430 
the mold goes it's actually pretty good
it's<00:00:41.430> proportionate<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.110> hardly

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's proportionate you know it's hardly

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.100 
it's proportionate you know it's hardly
any<00:00:43.589> obvious<00:00:43.920> robot<00:00:44.580> parts<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.720> there's<00:00:45.960> some

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
any obvious robot parts and there's some

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.369 
any obvious robot parts and there's some
nice<00:00:46.350> details<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.150> interior<00:00:48.780> even<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
nice details on the interior even has a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.899 
nice details on the interior even has a
steering<00:00:49.830> wheel<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.610> seat<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> forks

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
steering wheel and a seat the forks

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.649 
steering wheel and a seat the forks
don't<00:00:54.360> slide<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.229> sadly<00:00:56.510> but<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
don't slide up and down sadly but you

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.960 
don't slide up and down sadly but you
can<00:00:57.900> tilt<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.290> section<00:00:58.860> back<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.460> raise<00:00:59.670> them

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
can tilt the section back to raise them

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.420 
can tilt the section back to raise them
so<00:01:00.869> you<00:01:00.930> still<00:01:01.409> get<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.619> bit<00:01:01.799> of<00:01:01.920> play<00:01:02.159> value

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so you still get a bit of play value

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
so you still get a bit of play value
here<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> steering<00:01:06.299> wheel<00:01:06.510> doesn't<00:01:06.960> connect

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
here the steering wheel doesn't connect

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
here the steering wheel doesn't connect
to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> front<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:09.060> mold

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

problem<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.560> mode<00:01:12.890> what<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.310> hurts

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
problem with this mode what really hurts

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.870 
problem with this mode what really hurts
this<00:01:15.000> guy<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.659> color<00:01:15.899> scheme<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this guy is the color scheme it's a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.419 
this guy is the color scheme it's a
similar<00:01:18.420> yellowish<00:01:19.020> green<00:01:19.380> used<00:01:19.679> on<00:01:19.950> movie

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
similar yellowish green used on movie

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.200 
similar yellowish green used on movie
ratchet<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:22.439> didn't<00:01:22.829> look<00:01:22.979> great<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
ratchet it didn't look great then and it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.800 
ratchet it didn't look great then and it
certainly<00:01:24.689> doesn't<00:01:24.960> look<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:26.810> granted

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
certainly doesn't look good here granted

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560 
certainly doesn't look good here granted
it<00:01:27.929> gives<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> Constructicons<00:01:29.219> feel<00:01:29.570> but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it gives them a Constructicons feel but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.859 
it gives them a Constructicons feel but
even<00:01:30.899> still<00:01:31.109> as<00:01:33.020> an<00:01:34.020> aside<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.009> gray<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.609> dull

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
even still as an aside the gray is dull

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
even still as an aside the gray is dull
but<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.020> least<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.499> an<00:01:37.619> appropriate<00:01:38.130> color

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but at least it's an appropriate color

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
but at least it's an appropriate color
for<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> forklift<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:41.840> transformation<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
for a forklift the transformation is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319 
for a forklift the transformation is
fairly<00:01:43.289> involved<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> reason<00:01:45.179> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
fairly involved but is the reason the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:02:10.770 
fairly involved but is the reason the
forks<00:01:45.749> don't<00:01:46.020> slide<00:01:46.319> up<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.679> down

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
