00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
like that a little bit more

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
like that a little bit more
action-packed<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.390> why<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> enjoy

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
action-packed so that's why I enjoy

close<00:01:46.470> quarters<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.610> close<00:01:47.820> quarters<00:01:48.060> i

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
close quarters and for close quarters i

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.330 
close quarters and for close quarters i
think<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.630> weapon<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> perfect<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
think this weapon is perfect because of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
think this weapon is perfect because of
its<00:01:50.490> rate<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> fire<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
its rate of fire just think about this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
its rate of fire just think about this
you're<00:01:51.990> running<00:01:52.259> down<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.979> enemy<00:01:53.310> comes<00:01:53.490> out

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you're running down that enemy comes out

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160 
you're running down that enemy comes out
of<00:01:53.759> nowhere<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.509> guys<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of nowhere if you guys are about to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
of nowhere if you guys are about to
exchange<00:01:55.380> fire<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.369> definitely<00:01:56.700> gonna

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
exchange fire you are definitely gonna

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
exchange fire you are definitely gonna
have<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> advantage<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.439> i<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.250> can

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
have the advantage and i think you can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.740 
have the advantage and i think you can
kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> throughout<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.360> video<00:02:00.570> i

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
