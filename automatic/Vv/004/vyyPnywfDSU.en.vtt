00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
quad was because every time you look at

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.470 
quad was because every time you look at
pictures<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.130> like<00:00:39.280> Asian<00:00:39.579> actresses<00:00:40.150> or

for that because as you can see it's
quite<00:00:50.110> shimmery<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.579> that's<00:00:52.120> why<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.300> got<00:00:52.450> that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630

and<00:01:26.529> very<00:01:26.829> very<00:01:27.069> wearable<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:27.909> that's<00:01:28.060> why

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and very very wearable and so that's why

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.239 
and very very wearable and so that's why
I<00:01:28.299> decided<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.779> get<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.170> quad<00:01:29.499> it<00:01:29.889> actually

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
I decided to get this quad it actually

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.099 
I decided to get this quad it actually
comes<00:01:30.399> with<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.700> sponge<00:01:30.939> tip<00:01:31.270> applicator<00:01:31.329> but

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
comes with a sponge tip applicator but

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.330 
comes with a sponge tip applicator but
then<00:01:32.289> I<00:01:32.529> lost<00:01:33.009> my<00:01:33.219> own<00:01:33.459> over<00:01:33.789> 1<00:01:33.999> so<00:01:34.590> no<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
then I lost my own over 1 so no the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.139 
then I lost my own over 1 so no the
third<00:01:36.520> thing<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.729> probably<00:01:36.999> the<00:01:37.119> most

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
third thing is probably the most

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.179 
third thing is probably the most
exciting<00:01:37.420> thing<00:01:37.929> for<00:01:37.959> me<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.770> got<00:01:39.009> this

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:05.819 
tried anything from a tude house
actually<00:02:05.349> one<00:02:05.469> of<00:02:05.499> my<00:02:05.590> subscribers

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
actually one of my subscribers

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.769 
actually one of my subscribers
recommended<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.880> me<00:02:07.149> because<00:02:07.539> she<00:02:07.749> knows

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
recommended this to me because she knows

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.779 
recommended this to me because she knows
that<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.229> very<00:02:08.590> oily<00:02:08.890> eyelids<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.640> this

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
that I have very oily eyelids and this

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.880 
that I have very oily eyelids and this
is<00:02:09.910> actually<00:02:10.119> there<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.599> strong<00:02:10.869> ice<00:02:11.140> cream

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
is actually there is strong ice cream

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.550 
is actually there is strong ice cream
and<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.910> would<00:02:13.150> say<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.750> texture<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.170> something

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and I would say the texture is something

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.559 
and I would say the texture is something
in<00:02:14.710> between<00:02:14.860> max<00:02:15.370> fluid<00:02:15.790> line<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.180> makeup

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
in between max fluid line and makeup

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.240 
in between max fluid line and makeup
forever's<00:02:16.930> now<00:02:17.350> make<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.800> ever's<00:02:17.980> has<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
forever's now make up for ever's has to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.370 
forever's now make up for ever's has to
be<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.640> dry<00:02:18.970> kind<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.420> cakey<00:02:19.780> almost<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
be really dry kind of cakey almost and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.650 
be really dry kind of cakey almost and
then<00:02:20.800> fluidline<00:02:21.459> tends<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.880> be<00:02:21.970> really<00:02:22.450> really

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
then fluidline tends to be really really

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.680 
then fluidline tends to be really really
gel<00:02:23.050> like<00:02:23.230> really<00:02:23.530> watery<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.240> texture

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
gel like really watery then the texture

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.630 
gel like really watery then the texture
somewhere<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.140> between<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> really

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
somewhere in between there but I really

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000 
somewhere in between there but I really
like<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.209> because<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.720> staying<00:02:29.050> power<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
like this because the staying power is a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.770 
like this because the staying power is a
lot<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.490> makeup<00:02:30.760> forever's<00:02:31.209> maybe<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.540> little

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
lot like makeup forever's maybe a little

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
lot like makeup forever's maybe a little
better<00:02:32.050> even<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.590> get<00:02:32.770> forevers<00:02:33.160> I've

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
better even then you get forevers I've

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.770 
better even then you get forevers I've
been<00:02:33.520> using<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.060> lot<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.420> my<00:02:34.450> lower

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
been using this a lot on my lower

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930 
been using this a lot on my lower
lashline<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.560> my<00:02:36.010> upper<00:02:36.280> waterline<00:02:36.580> just

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
lashline and my upper waterline just

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.490 
lashline and my upper waterline just
because<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.360> stays<00:02:37.630> really<00:02:37.660> well<00:02:38.080> pretty<00:02:38.320> much

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
because it stays really well pretty much

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.229 
because it stays really well pretty much
all<00:02:38.739> day<00:02:38.770> which<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.880> really<00:02:40.030> impressive

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
all day which is really impressive

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.550 
all day which is really impressive
because<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.720> really<00:02:40.870> hard<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.230> get<00:02:41.350> things

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
because it's really hard to get things

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440 
because it's really hard to get things
that<00:02:41.739> will<00:02:41.860> stay<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.040> your<00:02:42.190> waterline<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:43.300> is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
that will stay on your waterline this is

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.630 
that will stay on your waterline this is
one<00:02:43.660> swatch<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.280> see<00:02:45.459> it's

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
one swatch of it so as you can see it's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.890 
one swatch of it so as you can see it's
really<00:02:45.880> pretty<00:02:46.120> darkly<00:02:46.570> pigmented

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
really pretty darkly pigmented

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.440 
really pretty darkly pigmented
considering<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.220> not<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.940> black<00:02:49.180> one

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
considering this is the not as black one

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.110 
considering this is the not as black one
I've<00:02:50.110> got<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> 02<00:02:50.739> secret<00:02:51.370> black<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.730> think<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I've got the 02 secret black I think the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.940 
I've got the 02 secret black I think the
number<00:02:52.390> one<00:02:52.630> strong<00:02:53.080> black<00:02:53.410> color<00:02:53.709> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
number one strong black color is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.340 
number one strong black color is
actually<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.910> lot<00:02:55.209> darker<00:02:55.510> than<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.959> one<00:02:56.170> but

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
actually a lot darker than this one but

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.810 
actually a lot darker than this one but
at<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.620> time<00:02:56.650> when<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.070> got<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.519> from

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
at the time when I got this from

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.540 
at the time when I got this from
yesstyle<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.750> only<00:02:58.930> had<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.560> 02<00:02:59.890> secret

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
yesstyle they only had the 02 secret

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.920 
yesstyle they only had the 02 secret
black<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.090> that's<00:03:01.239> just<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.600> one<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.840> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
black and so that's just the one that I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.870 
black and so that's just the one that I
got<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.560> also<00:03:02.739> comes<00:03:03.070> with<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.310> little<00:03:03.640> brush

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
got it also comes with a little brush

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.330 
got it also comes with a little brush
that<00:03:04.120> has<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.300> cap<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.930> don't<00:03:05.860> really<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.130> if<00:03:06.160> I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
that has a cap I don't really know if I

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
that has a cap I don't really know if I
would<00:03:06.489> use<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.760> brush<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.300> because<00:03:07.390> when

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
would use the brush so just because when

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.120 
would use the brush so just because when
I<00:03:07.660> did<00:03:07.900> use<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.110> brush<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> product<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
I did use the brush of the product I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.160 
I did use the brush of the product I
find<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> brush<00:03:10.300> actually<00:03:10.720> makes<00:03:10.959> it

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
find that the brush actually makes it

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.690 
find that the brush actually makes it
kind<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.530> skip<00:03:11.860> because<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.580> bit

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
kind of skip because it's a little bit

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.430 
kind of skip because it's a little bit
softer<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.570> said<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.230> bit

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
softer like I said this is a little bit

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.199 
softer like I said this is a little bit
more<00:03:14.590> dense<00:03:14.950> than<00:03:15.070> max<00:03:15.400> fluid<00:03:15.730> line<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.060> do

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
more dense than max fluid line so I do

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.819 
more dense than max fluid line so I do
prefer<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.690> little<00:03:16.989> bit<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.320> stiffer<00:03:17.620> brush

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
prefer a little bit of a stiffer brush

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.500 
prefer a little bit of a stiffer brush
and<00:03:18.280> when<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.519> use<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.880> different<00:03:19.269> brush<00:03:19.390> I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and when I use this different brush I

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.640 
and when I use this different brush I
didn't<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.810> any<00:03:19.959> problem<00:03:20.320> with<00:03:20.380> skipping

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
didn't have any problem with skipping

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.960 
didn't have any problem with skipping
but<00:03:20.890> when<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.070> use<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.280> brush<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> came

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
but when I use the brush that it came

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.120 
but when I use the brush that it came
with<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.810> didn't<00:03:23.170> apply<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.560> product<00:03:23.920> as

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
with it just didn't apply the product as

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.310 
with it just didn't apply the product as
evenly<00:03:24.489> or<00:03:24.790> as<00:03:25.090> darkly<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.959> preferred

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
evenly or as darkly and so I preferred

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.110 
evenly or as darkly and so I preferred
using<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.070> darker<00:03:27.400> brush<00:03:27.579> not<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.940> brush

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
using just a darker brush not the brush

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.060 
using just a darker brush not the brush
that<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.329> came<00:03:28.420> with<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.440> can<00:03:29.560> also<00:03:29.680> attach

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
that I came with but you can also attach

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.590 
that I came with but you can also attach
that<00:03:30.310> brush<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.730> lid<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.420> because

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
that brush the lid if you want because

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.060 
that brush the lid if you want because
it<00:03:31.750> has<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:32.079> little<00:03:32.290> holes<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
it has like little holes for you to

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.800 
it has like little holes for you to
Tasha<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.579> don't<00:03:34.150> know<00:03:34.239> why<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.450> would<00:03:34.660> do<00:03:34.780> that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
Tasha I don't know why you would do that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.140 
Tasha I don't know why you would do that
but<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.470> case<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.829> wanted<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.640> could<00:03:36.820> yes
