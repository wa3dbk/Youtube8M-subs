 Russian computer for 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.560
 specialized solutions and its worth 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.360
 support others say it's just 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.760
 rollback 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.410
 while Russian developers are selling 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.260
 their computers at a fabulous price 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.050
 california engineers next 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.200

 eight phases using components 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.409
 military class 4 which will allow pretty 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.399
 not bad to overclock the latest processors 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.990
 from andy 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:35.029
 there are four slots for operational

 380 370 and 360 as expected miracle not 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.459
 It happened 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.830
 video cards will use chips 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:00.830
 two years ago using 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.560
 outdated architecture yes what's there 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.149
 just copying familiar cards 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.459
 past rulers flagship will be r9 380 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:13.789
 which is based on the tonga chip is gone 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:16.399
 a year old from 1790 by two 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.409
 thread processors besides in 

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:21.919
 ruler were added two new models 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:25.080
 radeon r7 300 which is also based 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.410
 on existing chips 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.690
 well, a sweet snack soon for gta 5 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.030
 will be available mod from ice hunter 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.979
 improve the graphics so far mod 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.860
 is in pre-alpha 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:40.740
 and not so noticeably changes the game however 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.410
 the same thing happened with the first versions of the mod 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.750
 for gta 4 in general, so far you can 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.360
 enjoy the video where still visible 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.180
 visual transformations and that's it 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.160
 with you were those on the news 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.770
 now the output of each issue depends 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.860
 only from you details in the information to 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.860
