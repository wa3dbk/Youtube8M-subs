co-op<00:00:25.710> run<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.750> someone<00:00:28.170> sent<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.560> me

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
co-op run and i think someone sent to me

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.540 
co-op run and i think someone sent to me
a<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.769> 103<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.070> least<00:00:32.219> told<00:00:32.430> me

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a what is it a 103 or at least told me

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
a what is it a 103 or at least told me
they<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> 103<00:00:33.360> which<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> even<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.469> just

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
they got a 103 which is even more just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
they got a 103 which is even more just
mind-boggling<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.239> me<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.630> someone

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
mind-boggling to me that someone

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.619 
mind-boggling to me that someone
actually<00:00:37.200> beat<00:00:37.620> their<00:00:37.800> 101<00:00:38.250> co-op<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.210> i<00:00:39.239> don't

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
actually beat their 101 co-op so i don't

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110 
actually beat their 101 co-op so i don't
think<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> world<00:00:40.200> record<00:00:40.469> anymore<00:00:41.219> but

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
think this is a world record anymore but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.610 
think this is a world record anymore but

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
I mean to get to 101 rounds co-op is

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
I mean to get to 101 rounds co-op is
absolutely<00:00:46.620> astronomically<00:00:47.579> incredible<00:00:48.180> so
