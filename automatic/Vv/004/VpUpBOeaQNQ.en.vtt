 selected or for playstation 4 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.510
 depending on your case 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.790
 when adding to the game they have already gone 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.050
 correctly and good to occupy 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.260
 restarting it seems to me this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.150
 activity what does that mean when you 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.350

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.990

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.210
 in the shell I give a click 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.370

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 the flavors of 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.349

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.819
 palomita and has already been done to those who 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.689
 want but in this case there is a 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.300
 more general search for objects all 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:02.730

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.049

 and good 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.580
 I have it, that's why I always 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.470
 remove from the game 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.560
