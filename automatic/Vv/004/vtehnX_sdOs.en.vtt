00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello today we will try 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.130
 repair the notebook at the matrix is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.179
 we have a matrix of diagonal 15 6 model b 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.150
 156 added them 02 in 2 general repairs 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 matrices 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.189
 it is advisable to produce when 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.880
 there is no mechanical damage 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 as a rule the matrix they are very reliable and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.669
 fail only when occurs 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.680
 q this is already mechanical 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.129
 impact on the matrix itself 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 but here we have this whole matrix no 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 damage in the matrix itself is not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 revealed and she will now show how 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.390
 way we will feed through the food on 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.390
 raft and see what happens 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.049
 the light just lights up and remains 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:26.229
 such a gray background on the matrix itself now 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:29.619
 I threw a working dough I lie I have 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:34.090
 This, too, for verification but she flowed 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.039
 that's why so here flowed into the matrix 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.329
 it is naturally impossible to recover either 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:44.259
 therefore she stands only for 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.090
 checks 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.179
 quality look at which you can 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.179
 test 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.030
 boards look how it behaves 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.120
 and see that the image is normal 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.859
 but here , be patient everywhere 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.939
 matrix workers but check on it 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:28.010
 the image is basically possible so 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:30.500
 now try to repair this 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.109
 Here is the matrix that we just give 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.230
 so light gray 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.689
 the screen means I already had attempts 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.069
 repair I changed two here these 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:45.530
 and traffic but it did not give anything now 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.439
 there was the same exact matrix broken 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.370
 I have already removed the controller from there and now we 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:56.900
 let's try to replace this controller 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.840
 let's see what happens 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.349
 honestly need to drop this one 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.659
 the controller that we are under suspicion 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:12.620
 their solder in his place here this one 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.859
 removed donor fees so put a little bit 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.859
 flux 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.520
 I will put a small crane here 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.930
 to protect the plumes of the matrix from 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.830
 overheating and now we will solder this 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.600
 microcircuit 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.600
 with the help of a hot air Finn 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.920
 acorn contacts avalanche lead solder 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 a plus 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.060
 when 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:20.580
 so we all soldered but you chip and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:23.160
 now under the microscope now i will look 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.120
 are all legs slaughtered and if all 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.020
 OK, then we will check this 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.020
 we have the result 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:01.170
 now connect our matrix and 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:08.040
 let's see if we have a picture that thought 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:11.030
 we repair it so we connect 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.030
 nutrition 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.849
 and try to include 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.460
 All pictures we had 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:39.879
 so that the matrix has earned and now 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.449
 I'll try again to include everything all 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.449
 fine 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:58.280
 so here and so we managed 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.840
 repair just such a matrix 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.490
 I hope it was interesting and useful to everyone 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.490
 thank you for your attention bye
