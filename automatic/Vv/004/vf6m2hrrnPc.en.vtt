00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
work of art there's a lot of really

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.070 
work of art there's a lot of really
special<00:00:11.280> features<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> lot<00:00:13.049> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
special features are going on a lot of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.140 
special features are going on a lot of
work<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.620> been<00:00:13.740> put<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.429> car<00:00:14.730> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
work that's been put into this car to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.939 
work that's been put into this car to
get<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.360> ready<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.049> particular<00:00:16.500> meeting

get it ready for this particular meeting

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
get it ready for this particular meeting
so<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.609> thought<00:00:17.760> we'd<00:00:17.940> take<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> time<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> have

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
so we thought we'd take the time to have

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.080 
so we thought we'd take the time to have
a<00:00:18.660> chat<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.960> Denny<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.619> first<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.640> let's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
a chat to Denny and first of all let's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
a chat to Denny and first of all let's
start<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> impetus<00:00:22.500> behind

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
start with what was the impetus behind

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
start with what was the impetus behind
building<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> mesda<00:00:23.850> mx-5<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.750> world<00:00:24.900> timer

Australia<00:00:34.910> may<00:00:35.910> seems<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> car<00:00:36.630> that's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
Australia may seems to have a car that's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
Australia may seems to have a car that's
going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> support<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.559> business<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.190> yeah

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
going to support that business then yeah

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.330 
going to support that business then yeah
now<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> look<00:00:40.559> around<00:00:40.680> world<00:00:41.070> Time

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
now when we look around world Time

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
now when we look around world Time
Attack<00:00:41.460> obviously<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.149> car<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.570> reasonably

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Attack obviously this car is reasonably

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.020 
Attack obviously this car is reasonably
extreme<00:00:43.500> when<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:44.430> looking<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.879> building

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
extreme when you're looking at building

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.420 
extreme when you're looking at building
a<00:00:45.300> car<00:00:45.539> from<00:00:45.780> scratch<00:00:46.160> two-wheel<00:00:47.160> drive

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a car from scratch two-wheel drive

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.069 
a car from scratch two-wheel drive
versus<00:00:47.820> four-wheel<00:00:48.210> drive<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
versus four-wheel drive how much of a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
versus four-wheel drive how much of a
disadvantage<00:00:49.440> does<00:00:49.950> two-wheel<00:00:50.399> drive<00:00:50.640> put

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
disadvantage does two-wheel drive put

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.110 
disadvantage does two-wheel drive put
you<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:52.050> definitely<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> disadvantage

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
you at it's definitely a disadvantage

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000 
you at it's definitely a disadvantage
compared<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> four-wheel<00:00:54.600> drives

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
compared to the four-wheel drives

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.170 
compared to the four-wheel drives
especially<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.370> horsepower<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> these

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
especially the horsepower that these

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549 
especially the horsepower that these
cars<00:00:57.420> generate<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.079> only<00:00:58.170> putting<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
cars generate now I'm only putting it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.619 
cars generate now I'm only putting it
through<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.949> single<00:00:59.340> axle<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> speak<00:01:00.390> yeah

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
through a single axle so to speak yeah

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
through a single axle so to speak yeah
there<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> disadvantage<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:03.920> my<00:01:04.920> focus

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
there it is a disadvantage but my focus

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
there it is a disadvantage but my focus
has<00:01:05.489> been<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.360> getting<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> most<00:01:07.439> out

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
has been more so on getting the most out

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.690 
has been more so on getting the most out
of<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.860> rear-wheel<00:01:08.130> drive<00:01:08.159> car<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
of a rear-wheel drive car and that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
of a rear-wheel drive car and that
performance<00:01:09.210> yeah<00:01:09.780> yeah<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.770> talked<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> me

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
performance yeah yeah you talked to me

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
performance yeah yeah you talked to me
earlier<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.180> cars<00:01:12.630> been<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> boat

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
earlier about the cars been in the boat

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
earlier about the cars been in the boat
for<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.470> nine<00:01:13.890> years<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.850> want<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
for about nine years I just just want to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640 
for about nine years I just just want to
go<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.450> said<00:01:15.990> originally<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.619> were

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
go back you said originally you were

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
go back you said originally you were
running<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> renesis<00:01:17.880> engine<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.540> think

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
running the renesis engine and I think

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.149 
running the renesis engine and I think
you<00:01:18.810> said<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> had<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> supercharged<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you said you had a supercharged on it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.990 
you said you had a supercharged on it
was<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> supercharged<00:01:21.360> renesis<00:01:22.070> which<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.369> had

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
was a supercharged renesis which I had

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719 
was a supercharged renesis which I had
the<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.110> similar<00:01:25.680> kit<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> road-going

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the same similar kit in a road-going

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.240 
the same similar kit in a road-going
rx-8<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.049> had<00:01:28.259> some<00:01:28.439> inherent<00:01:28.590> design

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
rx-8 but it had some inherent design

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
rx-8 but it had some inherent design
flaws<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:30.619> gave<00:01:31.619> me<00:01:31.770> concern<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> didn't

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
flaws which gave me concern I didn't

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
flaws which gave me concern I didn't
want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> invest<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.170> get

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
want to invest the time into it to get

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
want to invest the time into it to get
it<00:01:34.409> right<00:01:34.590> when<00:01:34.860> I'll<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.060> same

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it right when I'll get a the same

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
it right when I'll get a the same
horsepower<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> better<00:01:37.079> result<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.619> more

from<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> start<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.610> way<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.939> win<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
from the start is that way you win that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.160 
from the start is that way you win that
way<00:01:54.390> absolutely

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
way absolutely

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
yeah what sort of ribs can you pull in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.590 
yeah what sort of ribs can you pull in
it<00:02:11.950> I've<00:02:12.950> been<00:02:13.130> hitting<00:02:13.340> about<00:02:13.610> ten<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.270> ten

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
it I've been hitting about ten for ten

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.870 
it I've been hitting about ten for ten
thousand<00:02:14.900> four<00:02:14.990> hundred<00:02:15.050> rpm<00:02:15.560> yeah<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
thousand four hundred rpm yeah that it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.270 
thousand four hundred rpm yeah that it
sounds<00:02:17.120> pretty<00:02:17.330> good<00:02:17.480> with<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.690> twenty<00:02:18.650> bpp<00:02:19.160> at

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
sounds pretty good with a twenty bpp at

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.170 
sounds pretty good with a twenty bpp at
that<00:02:19.400> sort<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.640> RPM

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that sort of RPM

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.220 
that sort of RPM
let's<00:02:20.420> talk<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> little<00:02:20.690> bit<00:02:20.960> about<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
let's talk a little bit about the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.690 
let's talk a little bit about the
electronics<00:02:21.800> package<00:02:22.100> can<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.370> talk<00:02:22.580> us

electronics package can you talk us

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.130 
electronics package can you talk us
through<00:02:22.730> what<00:02:22.970> you've<00:02:23.240> got<00:02:23.450> controlling<00:02:24.020> this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
through what you've got controlling this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.080 
through what you've got controlling this
engine<00:02:24.500> yep<00:02:24.680> okay<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.550> essentially<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
engine yep okay it's essentially a

their single camera option as well with
that<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.430> you've<00:02:37.580> got<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> addition

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
that and I see you've got a addition

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.780 
that and I see you've got a addition
there<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:38.660> well<00:02:38.840> as<00:02:38.930> motek<00:02:39.260> c12<00:02:39.740> 595<00:02:40.460> as<00:02:40.640> well

there as well as motek c12 595 as well
yes<00:02:41.000> with<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> GPS<00:02:41.690> function<00:02:42.020> for<00:02:42.170> that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
yes with the GPS function for that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.800 
yes with the GPS function for that
timing<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.920> all<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.160> yes<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.030> now<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.540> terms

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
timing and all that yes and now in terms

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.300 
timing and all that yes and now in terms
of<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.200> data<00:02:45.410> analysis<00:02:45.890> on<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> car

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
of the data analysis on the car

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.590 
of the data analysis on the car
obviously<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:46.790> pretty<00:02:47.000> important<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.480> get

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
obviously that's pretty important to get

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.300 
obviously that's pretty important to get
the<00:02:47.750> most<00:02:47.930> out<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.200> these<00:02:48.350> cars<00:02:48.650> water<00:02:48.920> what

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the most out of these cars water what

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.800 
the most out of these cars water what
sort<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.610> data<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.210> got<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.600> what<00:02:50.720> are

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.090 
also got eg T's on each rotor as well
yep<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.959> sort<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.350> had<00:03:15.560> enough<00:03:15.590> track

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
yep and you sort of had enough track

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.350 
yep and you sort of had enough track
time<00:03:16.310> yet<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> look<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.030> any<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.270> that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
time yet to have a look at any of that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.910 
time yet to have a look at any of that
data<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.810> make<00:03:17.900> changes<00:03:18.230> based<00:03:18.470> on<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.680> ah

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
data and make changes based on that ah

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.370 
data and make changes based on that ah
you're<00:03:19.670> not<00:03:19.700> as<00:03:19.970> yet<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.630> has<00:03:20.780> highlighted

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
you're not as yet but it has highlighted

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.190 
you're not as yet but it has highlighted
we've<00:03:22.040> got<00:03:22.220> we've<00:03:22.490> got<00:03:22.520> an<00:03:22.670> issue<00:03:22.760> with<00:03:23.200> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
we've got we've got an issue with the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.310 
we've got we've got an issue with the
cooling<00:03:24.770> system<00:03:25.070> being<00:03:25.310> too<00:03:25.490> efficient<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
cooling system being too efficient and

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.170 
cooling system being too efficient and
the<00:03:27.320> engine<00:03:27.709> coolant<00:03:28.040> temps<00:03:28.310> are<00:03:28.459> too<00:03:28.760> low<00:03:28.940> and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the engine coolant temps are too low and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.000 
the engine coolant temps are too low and
it's<00:03:29.300> causing<00:03:29.720> us<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.959> go<00:03:30.050> into<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.380> richer<00:03:30.770> part

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
it's causing us to go into a richer part

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.760 
it's causing us to go into a richer part
of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.190> mapping<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.270> we<00:03:32.390> need<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
of the mapping and so we need to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.560 
of the mapping and so we need to
increase<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:34.040> engine<00:03:34.310> temp<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:34.880> it's<00:03:35.360> it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
increase the engine temp so it's it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.630 
increase the engine temp so it's it
drives<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.350> bit<00:03:36.470> better<00:03:36.620> yeah<00:03:37.010> have<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.400> got<00:03:37.550> an

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
drives a bit better yeah have you got an

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.920 
drives a bit better yeah have you got an
easy<00:03:37.760> fix<00:03:38.060> for<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.300> something<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.690> can<00:03:38.810> do

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
easy fix for that something you can do

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.479 
easy fix for that something you can do
that<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.290> weekends<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.890> get<00:03:40.040> through<00:03:40.190> it

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
that on the weekends to get through it

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.860 
that on the weekends to get through it
yeah<00:03:40.730> we<00:03:40.880> just<00:03:41.000> got<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.180> readjust<00:03:41.600> that

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
yeah we just got to readjust that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.630 
yeah we just got to readjust that
programming<00:03:42.380> in<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> PDM<00:03:42.950> torch<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.550> do

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
programming in the PDM torch it to do

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.979 
programming in the PDM torch it to do
that<00:03:43.850> just<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> slow<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.420> water<00:03:44.600> pump<00:03:44.810> down

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that just to slow the water pump down

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.100 
that just to slow the water pump down
that's<00:03:45.620> really<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.010> issue<00:03:46.040> yeah<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.630> PDM

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
that's really the issue yeah so the PDM

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.020 
that's really the issue yeah so the PDM
obviously<00:03:48.890> that's<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.220> product<00:03:49.640> power

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
obviously that's a product power

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.490 
obviously that's a product power
distribution<00:03:50.540> modules<00:03:50.840> are<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> product<00:03:51.230> we're

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
distribution modules are a product we're

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.100 
distribution modules are a product we're
seeing<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.860> lot<00:03:52.400> more<00:03:52.630> prevalent<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:53.870> form

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
seeing a lot more prevalent in this form

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.449 
seeing a lot more prevalent in this form
of<00:03:54.200> motorsport<00:03:54.440> now<00:03:54.770> couldn't<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.130> just<00:03:55.160> talk

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
of motorsport now couldn't you just talk

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.010 
of motorsport now couldn't you just talk
us<00:03:55.640> through<00:03:55.670> what<00:03:56.120> you're<00:03:56.420> actually<00:03:56.630> using<00:03:56.750> it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
us through what you're actually using it

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.500 
us through what you're actually using it
PDM<00:03:57.470> for<00:03:57.770> yeah<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.820> reason<00:03:58.940> for<00:03:59.150> going<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.420> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
PDM for yeah the reason for going to the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.479 
PDM for yeah the reason for going to the
PDM<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.320> does<00:04:00.770> replace<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.130> lot<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.370> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
PDM is it does replace a lot of the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.100 
PDM is it does replace a lot of the
solid-state<00:04:02.030> electronics<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.630> cars<00:04:02.780> used<00:04:03.020> to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
solid-state electronics of cars used to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.920 
solid-state electronics of cars used to
have<00:04:03.260> whether<00:04:03.770> you've<00:04:04.040> got<00:04:04.420> resistors

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
have whether you've got resistors

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.440 
have whether you've got resistors
realized<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:07.190> take<00:04:07.580> infuse<00:04:08.000> does<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.300> take

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
realized it take infuse does it take

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.510 
realized it take infuse does it take
it's<00:04:08.930> all<00:04:09.080> included<00:04:09.440> within<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.370> can

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
it's all included within it and you can

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.610 
it's all included within it and you can
actually<00:04:10.670> play<00:04:10.940> with<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.300> different

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
actually play with the different

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.010 
actually play with the different
amperages<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:12.830> require<00:04:13.130> for<00:04:13.160> different

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
amperages that you require for different

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.729 
amperages that you require for different
items<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> want<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.500> control

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
items that you want to control

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.499 
items that you want to control
and<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.190> resettable<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.150> speak<00:04:18.389> you're

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
and it's resettable so to speak you're

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.719 
and it's resettable so to speak you're
not<00:04:18.600> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> blow<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> fuse<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.489> can

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
not going to blow a fuse and you can

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.370 
not going to blow a fuse and you can
learn<00:04:20.850> from<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.150> yeah<00:04:21.389> it'll<00:04:21.660> also<00:04:21.810> tell<00:04:22.169> you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
learn from it yeah it'll also tell you

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.790 
learn from it yeah it'll also tell you
if<00:04:22.919> for<00:04:23.460> some<00:04:23.729> reason<00:04:24.180> an<00:04:24.750> item<00:04:25.320> say<00:04:25.560> water

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
if for some reason an item say water

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.350 
if for some reason an item say water
electric<00:04:26.100> water<00:04:26.280> pump<00:04:26.370> might<00:04:26.970> normally<00:04:27.210> be

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
electric water pump might normally be

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.700 
electric water pump might normally be
running<00:04:27.660> at<00:04:27.750> 15<00:04:28.080> amps<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.380> all<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.560> sudden

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
running at 15 amps and all the sudden

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.409 
running at 15 amps and all the sudden
it's<00:04:28.860> running<00:04:29.070> at<00:04:29.130> 20<00:04:29.400> you'll<00:04:30.270> know<00:04:30.389> that

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it's running at 20 you'll know that

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.180 
it's running at 20 you'll know that
there's<00:04:30.810> an<00:04:30.900> issue<00:04:30.990> there<00:04:31.169> why<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:31.979> you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
there's an issue there why is it and you

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.680 
there's an issue there why is it and you
can<00:04:32.340> deal<00:04:32.520> with<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.699> then<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.330> may<00:04:33.630> be

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
can deal with it then that it may be

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.749 
can deal with it then that it may be
failing<00:04:33.960> or<00:04:34.440> something's<00:04:34.740> jammed<00:04:34.949> so<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.610> can

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
failing or something's jammed so you can

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.580 
failing or something's jammed so you can
data<00:04:35.970> log<00:04:36.210> all<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.449> those<00:04:36.720> currents<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:37.350> loads

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
data log all of those currents and loads

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.590 
data log all of those currents and loads
so<00:04:37.830> if<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.400> look<00:04:38.610> at<00:04:38.759> some<00:04:38.970> historic<00:04:39.449> data

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
so if you look at some historic data

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.850 
so if you look at some historic data
from<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> car<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.229> can<00:04:40.350> actually<00:04:40.440> start

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
from the car you can actually start

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.830 
from the car you can actually start
seeing<00:04:41.160> if<00:04:41.340> something's<00:04:42.150> going<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.479> become<00:04:42.780> a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
seeing if something's going to become a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.659 
seeing if something's going to become a
problem<00:04:43.110> before<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.650> fails<00:04:43.860> yeah<00:04:44.400> that's

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
problem before it fails yeah that's

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.790 
problem before it fails yeah that's
right<00:04:44.880> absolutely<00:04:45.479> yeah<00:04:45.900> okay<00:04:46.350> let's<00:04:46.530> move<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
right absolutely yeah okay let's move a

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.730 
right absolutely yeah okay let's move a
little<00:04:46.919> bit<00:04:47.070> back<00:04:47.280> from<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.110> engine<00:04:49.110> talk

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
little bit back from the the engine talk

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.590 
little bit back from the the engine talk
to<00:04:50.280> us<00:04:50.370> about<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.669> transmission<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.449> the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
to us about the transmission and the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.020 
to us about the transmission and the
differential<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.620> sure<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.460> transmission

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
differential in it sure the transmission

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.760 
differential in it sure the transmission
is<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.180> series<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.750> our<00:04:54.960> execubots

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
is a series to our execubots

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.600 
is a series to our execubots
6-speed<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.150> diff<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.740> rx-8<00:04:58.740> housing

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
6-speed and the diff is a rx-8 housing

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.409 
6-speed and the diff is a rx-8 housing
with<00:05:01.729> five<00:05:02.729> 375<00:05:03.630> ratio<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.850> gives<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.240> car

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
with five 375 ratio so it gives the car

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.510 
with five 375 ratio so it gives the car
a<00:05:06.479> top<00:05:06.810> speed<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.110> about<00:05:07.289> 260<00:05:07.889> kilometers<00:05:08.430> an

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
a top speed of about 260 kilometers an

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.000 
a top speed of about 260 kilometers an
hour<00:05:08.610> at<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.360> moment<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.289> did<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.620> see

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
hour at the moment you know did you see

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.040 
hour at the moment you know did you see
those<00:05:11.160> components<00:05:11.789> being<00:05:12.030> up<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.539> torque

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
those components being up to the torque

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.290 
those components being up to the torque
and<00:05:13.229> power<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.860> 20<00:05:14.430> B's<00:05:14.610> putting<00:05:14.970> out<00:05:15.090> I

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
and power that the 20 B's putting out I

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.909 
and power that the 20 B's putting out I
don't<00:05:15.449> have<00:05:15.840> any<00:05:16.050> concerns<00:05:16.470> at<00:05:16.590> all<00:05:16.680> with<00:05:16.830> the

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
don't have any concerns at all with the

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.430 
don't have any concerns at all with the
diff<00:05:17.099> gearbox<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.300> think<00:05:18.570> we'll<00:05:18.690> be<00:05:18.780> okay<00:05:19.080> G<00:05:19.320> to

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
diff gearbox I think we'll be okay G to

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.050 
diff gearbox I think we'll be okay G to
the<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.830> way<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.130> torque<00:05:20.340> delivery<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.880> the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the the way the torque delivery of the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.589 
the the way the torque delivery of the
pp<00:05:22.430> uncorrect<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.669> think<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.000> peak<00:05:24.300> torque

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
pp uncorrect it I think the peak torque

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.779 
pp uncorrect it I think the peak torque
was<00:05:24.840> somewhere<00:05:25.650> in<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.830> mid<00:05:25.949> 300<00:05:26.490> Newton

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
was somewhere in the mid 300 Newton

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.279 
was somewhere in the mid 300 Newton
meters<00:05:27.060> unpredicted<00:05:27.660> that<00:05:27.840> was<00:05:27.960> measure<00:05:28.139> of

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
meters unpredicted that was measure of

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.740 
meters unpredicted that was measure of
the<00:05:28.349> wheels<00:05:28.500> yeah<00:05:28.910> okay<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:29.970> what<00:05:30.449> first

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
the wheels yeah okay so what first

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.540 
the wheels yeah okay so what first
caught<00:05:30.960> our<00:05:31.139> eye<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.500> course<00:05:31.710> was<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
caught our eye of course was the the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.899 
caught our eye of course was the the
bodywork<00:05:32.970> on<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.180> it's<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.720> pretty<00:05:33.960> extreme

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
bodywork on it it's a pretty extreme

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.159 
bodywork on it it's a pretty extreme
that<00:05:35.909> rear<00:05:36.150> clip<00:05:36.389> looks<00:05:36.630> like<00:05:36.810> it's<00:05:37.050> all

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
that rear clip looks like it's all

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.710 
that rear clip looks like it's all
carbon<00:05:37.710> what<00:05:38.580> have<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:38.849> done<00:05:39.030> with<00:05:39.270> the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
carbon what have you done with the

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.600 
carbon what have you done with the
bodywork<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.169> try<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.680> get<00:05:40.800> some<00:05:41.039> eurosam

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
bodywork to try and get some eurosam

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.339

downforce<00:05:42.120> which<00:05:42.330> again<00:05:42.599> is<00:05:42.780> so<00:05:42.990> prevalent

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
downforce which again is so prevalent

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.110 
downforce which again is so prevalent
here<00:05:43.770> at<00:05:43.860> world<00:05:44.039> time<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.490> yeah<00:05:44.729> as<00:05:44.970> you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
here at world time it's a yeah as you

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.210 
here at world time it's a yeah as you
said<00:05:45.330> Aero<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.409> pretty<00:05:46.740> much<00:05:46.889> everything

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
said Aero is pretty much everything

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.399 
said Aero is pretty much everything
these<00:05:47.639> days<00:05:47.699> with<00:05:48.150> time<00:05:48.659> attack<00:05:48.960> horsepower

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
these days with time attack horsepower

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.070 
these days with time attack horsepower
it<00:05:49.500> used<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.800> be<00:05:49.919> but<00:05:50.280> now<00:05:50.460> Aero<00:05:50.990> people<00:05:51.990> have

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
it used to be but now Aero people have

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.170 
it used to be but now Aero people have
in<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.560> recent<00:05:52.889> years<00:05:53.070> have<00:05:53.280> been<00:05:53.460> achieving

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
in the recent years have been achieving

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.300 
in the recent years have been achieving
quicker<00:05:54.900> laptops<00:05:55.320> with<00:05:55.470> less<00:05:55.650> horsepower<00:05:55.949> and

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
quicker laptops with less horsepower and

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.580 
quicker laptops with less horsepower and
better<00:05:56.490> arrow<00:05:56.729> and<00:05:57.389> that's<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.199> reason<00:05:58.470> we've

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
better arrow and that's the reason we've

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.020 
better arrow and that's the reason we've
gone<00:05:58.740> with<00:05:58.889> this<00:05:58.979> because<00:05:59.580> I'm<00:05:59.849> naturally

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
gone with this because I'm naturally

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.850 
gone with this because I'm naturally
aspirated<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.720> can't<00:06:00.960> just<00:06:01.169> wander<00:06:01.349> boost<00:06:01.650> up

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
aspirated I can't just wander boost up

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.620 
aspirated I can't just wander boost up
so<00:06:02.099> I<00:06:02.340> need<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.820> be<00:06:02.909> more<00:06:03.120> efficient<00:06:03.419> in<00:06:03.510> the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
so I need to be more efficient in the

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.930 
so I need to be more efficient in the
arrow<00:06:03.780> this<00:06:04.680> arrow<00:06:04.860> package<00:06:05.340> for<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.580> car<00:06:05.760> was

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
arrow this arrow package for the car was

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.120 
arrow this arrow package for the car was
designed<00:06:06.270> by<00:06:06.449> Andrew<00:06:06.930> Brent<00:06:07.260> from<00:06:07.440> OMB<00:06:07.830> arrow

designed by Andrew Brent from OMB arrow

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.939 
designed by Andrew Brent from OMB arrow
and<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.180> key<00:06:09.659> focus<00:06:10.080> for<00:06:10.110> him<00:06:10.380> on<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:10.740> car

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
and the key focus for him on this car

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.430 
and the key focus for him on this car
was<00:06:11.159> to<00:06:11.340> maximize<00:06:11.639> downforce<00:06:12.449> but<00:06:12.780> minimize

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
was to maximize downforce but minimize

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.950 
was to maximize downforce but minimize
drag<00:06:14.400> and<00:06:15.000> so<00:06:15.300> there<00:06:15.449> was<00:06:15.539> a<00:06:15.570> different

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
drag and so there was a different

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.980 
drag and so there was a different
direction<00:06:16.560> for<00:06:17.010> him<00:06:17.159> yeah<00:06:17.639> you<00:06:18.180> know<00:06:18.300> Andrew

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
direction for him yeah you know Andrew

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.170 
direction for him yeah you know Andrew

actually<00:06:28.110> got<00:06:28.469> some<00:06:28.770> data<00:06:29.099> I<00:06:29.310> mean

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
actually got some data I mean

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.320 
actually got some data I mean
you've<00:06:30.220> been<00:06:30.400> in<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.580> wind<00:06:30.820> tunnel<00:06:30.880> if<00:06:31.150> you<00:06:31.210> got

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
you've been in a wind tunnel if you got

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.790 
you've been in a wind tunnel if you got
some<00:06:31.510> butter<00:06:31.720> on<00:06:31.840> this<00:06:32.050> or<00:06:32.260> as<00:06:32.350> it<00:06:32.530> sort<00:06:32.740> of

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
some butter on this or as it sort of

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.860 
some butter on this or as it sort of
been<00:06:33.010> just<00:06:33.340> through<00:06:33.700> his<00:06:33.820> design<00:06:34.180> so<00:06:34.420> far<00:06:34.630> yeah

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
been just through his design so far yeah

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.470 
been just through his design so far yeah
the<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.710> design<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.490> he<00:06:36.730> uses<00:06:37.060> CFD

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
the the design that he uses CFD

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.240 
the the design that he uses CFD
computational<00:06:38.290> fluid<00:06:38.380> dynamics<00:06:38.920> and<00:06:39.040> it's

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
computational fluid dynamics and it's

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.740 
computational fluid dynamics and it's
all<00:06:39.370> been<00:06:39.520> done<00:06:39.700> on<00:06:39.850> computer<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.480> he's<00:06:40.570> been

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
all been done on computer and he's been

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.030 
all been done on computer and he's been
able<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:41.020> pinch<00:06:41.230> because<00:06:41.410> he's<00:06:41.650> been<00:06:41.800> involved

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
able to pinch because he's been involved

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.800 
able to pinch because he's been involved
for<00:06:42.310> so<00:06:42.430> many<00:06:42.520> years<00:06:42.790> now<00:06:42.970> he's<00:06:43.360> been<00:06:43.390> able<00:06:43.660> to

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
for so many years now he's been able to

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.740 
for so many years now he's been able to
benchmark<00:06:44.110> his<00:06:44.470> other<00:06:44.650> designs<00:06:45.450> and<00:06:46.450> use<00:06:46.600> it

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
benchmark his other designs and use it

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.800 
benchmark his other designs and use it
against<00:06:47.050> this<00:06:47.170> one<00:06:47.640> in<00:06:48.640> with<00:06:49.090> this<00:06:49.240> car<00:06:49.480> in<00:06:49.750> the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
against this one in with this car in the

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.840 
against this one in with this car in the
right<00:06:49.960> hands<00:06:50.290> on<00:06:50.380> a<00:06:50.440> sequential<00:06:50.800> box<00:06:51.130> it<00:06:51.430> would

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
right hands on a sequential box it would

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.880 
right hands on a sequential box it would
be<00:06:51.910> very<00:06:52.180> competitive<00:06:52.570> in<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:53.380> open<00:06:53.680> class

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
be very competitive in the open class

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.820 
be very competitive in the open class
and<00:06:54.220> in<00:06:54.520> a<00:06:54.610> professional<00:06:55.060> driver<00:06:55.240> yeah<00:06:55.960> well
