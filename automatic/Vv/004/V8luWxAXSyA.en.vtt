better<00:00:48.510> body<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:50.600> she<00:00:51.600> has<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.260> then<00:00:55.260> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
better body than she has so and then if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
better body than she has so and then if
I<00:00:55.469> wanted<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.039> shorter<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.550> I've

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I wanted a little shorter because I've

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
I wanted a little shorter because I've
already<00:00:56.969> carted<00:00:57.510> through<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:57.989> come

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
already carted through it I can come

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
already carted through it I can come
back<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.969> 7<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.480> against<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
back with the 7 up against and then that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
back with the 7 up against and then that
just<00:01:01.469> gives<00:01:01.680> me<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.250> wiggle<00:01:02.460> room

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
just gives me a little more wiggle room

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.320 
just gives me a little more wiggle room
when<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> blend<00:01:04.549> by<00:01:05.549> using<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> 7

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
when I go to blend by using the 7

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.859 
when I go to blend by using the 7
instead<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> 10<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:11.689> here's<00:01:12.689> my

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
instead of the 10 here so here's my

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.340 
instead of the 10 here so here's my
point

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
point

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280 
point

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to go to approximately three two fingers

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.359 
to go to approximately three two fingers
above<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.119> three<00:01:30.270> three<00:01:30.890> three<00:01:31.890> three

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
above two two three three three three

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
above two two three three three three
two<00:01:32.939> two<00:01:33.090> three<00:01:33.119> fingers<00:01:33.780> above<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
two two three fingers above the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740 
two two three fingers above the
breastbone<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:35.280> she's<00:01:35.640> been<00:01:36.299> taking<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
breastbone now she's been taking a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
breastbone now she's been taking a
little<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:37.110> shorter<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
little bit shorter so we're going to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560 
little bit shorter so we're going to
move<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.310> line<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> should

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
move that line up about where it should

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.499 
move that line up about where it should
be<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> move<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be because if I move take it down to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
be because if I move take it down to
here<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> expose<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.250> you
