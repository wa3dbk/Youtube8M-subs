real<00:00:18.210> problems<00:00:18.480> doing<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
real problems doing this I'm going to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.200 
real problems doing this I'm going to
show<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.060> right

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
show you how to get it right

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
show you how to get it right
you<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.390> lighting<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> white<00:00:25.470> background<00:00:25.920> is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you know lighting a white background is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
you know lighting a white background is
very<00:00:26.940> easy<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.619> background<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
very easy really the background is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
very easy really the background is
already<00:00:29.820> white<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> expose<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
already white so if we expose it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.070 
already white so if we expose it
correctly<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.489> reproduce<00:00:32.850> white<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.629> we

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
correctly it will reproduce white if we

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.439 
correctly it will reproduce white if we
over<00:00:34.410> expose<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.070> fractionally<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.330> be

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
over expose it fractionally it will be

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.780 
over expose it fractionally it will be
even<00:00:36.570> better<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.130> take<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> meter

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
even better I'm going to take a meter

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.760 
even better I'm going to take a meter
reading<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.720> instead<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> using<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.470> saintly

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
reading but instead of using a saintly
