 my lg tv here has three usb connections 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.579
 I'm already using one for that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.520
 external hard drive for recording 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.980
 other usb ports just inside 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.640
 because I would like to see the things 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.800
 look at 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.309
 after the usb stick is inserted 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.019
 may you please press the input and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.890
 can then jump directly to the usb stick too 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.149
 to grab 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.739
 Here you can see the ones 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.890
 hard disk that is the red symbol 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.749
 for the recording and there it goes 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.480

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.380
 an overview smart scheer 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.229
 and that tells me about this device 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.120
 it has a drive and this one has three 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.710
 folder and then I can do it now 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.600
 I would like to mine 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.030
 vacation pictures look so in the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.220
 pictures and wow they are really 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.470
 really great to see first in the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.810
 small view and then I think 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.540
 man, of course, goes big too 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.590
 I have the picture in big down is still 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.510
 the strip because I can now even 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.970
 can go through times of my image 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.100
 call daughter and see the format 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.490
 filling now even on my lg 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.870
 tv is that easy 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.480
 but that's not all we push you 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.400
 go back to the keys yet 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.430
 once back to the folder view 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.380
 then open at the music folder and 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.260
 lo and behold I have folders for certain 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.380

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.140
 Cover with displayed and little times that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.400
 but that's what I want to listen to 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.400
 make a little volume on it 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.189
 I also have the cover of the CD with 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.599
 if I have a great information 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.220
 of course, then for a party 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.680

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.019
 class once to stop and then back 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.659
 into the menu and last but not least 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.519
 Of course, one of the most important things I want 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.829
 I also watch videos 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.200
 that means videos from my computer 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.019
 at photos music and videos a variety 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.599
 of formats so I added him now 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.319
 the videos for example, a video 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.590
 in full hd can show 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:57.989

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:07.769
 the little usb-stick is nice and small 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.319
 film but there is something easier 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:16.010
 and there is something more in her 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:18.560
 new lg tv and although the technology dlna 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.569
 behind it hides the possibility 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.239
 that your files your photos their 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.489
 music is no longer watching your videos 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.079
 Computer copied to the usb-stick and 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.690
 then take the usb stick in the 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.639
 Plug in the TV but the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.129

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.099
 once completely out of this view 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.979
 and look there next to a usb stick 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.970
 great thing is just the usb 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.979
 possibility that I stop there 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.810
