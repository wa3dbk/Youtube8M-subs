00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.060
 Hello everyone today I would like to tell 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.890
 here 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.700
 he like me captcha fish let's see what u 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.110
 I have been amazed here 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.520
 not all points of course with steamed fish 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:37.190
 reason when we have here 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:42.770
 I have a perch Yakunin 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:47.450
 peel the kitchen mitrich because it is very 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.540
 troublesome therefore cleaner only 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.580
 offal and leaving fish to smoke can be 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.520
 principle and service very good 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.520
 It turns out and look for a pike 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:12.690
 that we have a piece here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.830
 five kilogram pigs or 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 4 kg 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:32.450
 so hurt bypassing now we come to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 following procedure 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.030
 so taxes i put fish 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.909
 defrost think hours for three four 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 she will defrost with me and it will be possible 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.830
 move on to the next stage 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.409
 so the fish broke up better of course 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.619
 use fresh but since now 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 hunt 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.210
 no possibility use autumn 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.190
 stocks so little secret will reveal for 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.360
 defrozen fish to clean 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.829
 from mucus is necessary 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.480
 pour a small amount of fish 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:21.299
 salt let stand 10-15 minutes and then 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.329
 rinse with running water all the mucus come 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:29.900
 the fish will in principle be as fresh as that 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.900
 what do we need 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:47.100
 the cheapest most simple yet 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 Soviet Union packages we take fish and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:03:10.380
 salt pike just like a red fish 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.210
 cold for three or four tinka 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:37.660
 up leave this fish to stand salt 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.660
 3-4 hours and then the most interesting 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:49.540
 after we have salted the fish we have it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.070
 about 3-4 hours later 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.950
 we stack we pour out more precisely shaving 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.470
 here we have captiva chko such naman ali 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.420
 it is worth pouring on one chip 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.470
 it is desirable to use chips of course 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.710
 fruit trees 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.840
 I use apple and pear for example 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:14.990
 then we lay out the fish and put the oil lamp 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:18.220
 on the grill for about 15 minutes but 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.220
 whichever flame you have 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:36.780
 so checking the contents of the gorgeous pike 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:43.650
 left the class for how many minutes have you already 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:49.199
 exactly stands on so well that's what we have 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:54.530
 It turned out that it is still a whole pair of it fish 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:58.759
 our pike roasted very well 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:02.490
 how her glasses were fried 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:06.690
 so you can see from the perch in Lutsk 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.720
 and if we are here now a little bit then 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.690
 so here it is all this skin with a man 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.840
 removed together so if you often 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.120
 catch good bass don't bother 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.639
 clean them if you like smoked fish 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.400
 then smoke perch allowances 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.180
 I canâ€™t get such appetite 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.090
 Nenko very good narrowly just clean 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.190
 peeled off very easily and meat here 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.889
 little white clean sorry camera not 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.330
 conveys all those flavors that 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.949
 my kitchen is now full 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:45.500
 but the flavors are just gorgeous after that 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:47.820
 a couple so to speak on the repetition of the Soviets 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.400
 use of course better fresh fish 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.310
 that is, not frozen well, I have so what 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.740
 circumstances that fresh fish was not 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.870
 frostbitten and pretty much so 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:03.930
 means thoroughly wash the fish salt 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.949
 her three or four hours give not put 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.099
 be careful not to pour 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.900
 a lot of salt fall asleep well salt because 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.639
 that the fish for these three to four hours more 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.349
 than she can take will not take here then 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:21.599
 thoroughly rinses with running water 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:23.090
 salt 1 water in the hangar checks good 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.280
 bonfire 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:31.139
 pour your oil lamp shavings 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.470
 fruit trees i still use 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.310
 perennial pear or apple 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:41.590
 or both here put 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.150
 we close the fish we put it all on fire 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.830
 literally, depending on which 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:51.560
 you have a fire what temperature will be 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:54.950
 about 20 25 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.600
 minutes to make it on the Copts you can 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.910
 be even 15 get ready all 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.690
 depends on the size of the fish here I have 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.020
 today somewhere about 25 minutes stood and 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:08.870
 all take off and enjoy all the appetite and 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:14.480
 the main thing do not forget to wash the oil lamp 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:16.030
 try to prepare your own fish 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.160
