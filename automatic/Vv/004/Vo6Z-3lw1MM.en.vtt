00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.990
 the food sector is one of the fastest growing in Brazil the country has the highest 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.139
 commercial herd of the world according to ibg research, so the 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.719
 milk and dairy products has a great market potential despite the fact that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.950
 shortage of professionals trained in small dairy 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.009
 whole economy is the second major accumulated 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.269
 of State 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.419
 the dairy also 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.649
 developing in the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.460
 State dairy product, the professional 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.600
 wanted 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.110
 We also know how out of state these market demands are. 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.250
 area that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 and promises what is already 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.240
 said to be that day of 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.530
 many paid 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 in all state 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.450
 I and all states in which there is production 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.920
 of milk that 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.610
 job vacancies they can yes act with the country shirt 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 as the courses are new and there is a shortage of professionals in the market 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.330
 still exists mainly in the north and northeast is where this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.150
 professional 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.860
 does not exist 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.940
 the monza we are the only institution in the north east northeast 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.860
 which offers the technology course 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 besides interest in the area, this good perspective of market places is more 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060
 an incentive for future professionals 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.329
 the professional 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.280
 in the area 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.390
 it is highly valued river if there is the concept that there is a demand 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.690
 and he made this assessment I did not interest myself - he questions when it comes to 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.620
 perpetuate 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.190
 laboratory quality certification 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.360
 with the shock is a campaign without too expansive and left alone in me I think a lot 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.730
 on top and knowledge 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.670
 not that people 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 can come here in theory we also come with silver 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 the dairy technologist can act in several sectors as in the analysis of the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.740
 quality of milk and milk 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.780
 the development and improvement of dairy products in the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.410
 condemnation of production and can also teach 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.610
 the professional participates in the whole process from the moment the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.470
 development of the product until it is commercialized. 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.430
 can work in factories farms institutes laboratories or 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.520
 universities is regulated by the Federal Council of 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.330
 engineering architecture and agronomy the starting salary is around a thousand and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.649
 five hundred reais 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.399
 to act in the area needs to be graduated 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.379
 here the federal institute of alagoas is the only one that offers the technological course 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.369
 in dairy products to study, it is necessary to make a 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.979
 competition of about 12 candidates for a university entrance examination is 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.939
 every year with two tickets are 40 seats throughout the year 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.859
 there are about 80 students in six classes 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.900
 they have disciplines like biology chemistry, mathematical microbiology and 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.209
 technology 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.169
 the classes are theoretical and practical in laboratories in these students analyze 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.889
 quality of the milk in the laboratory where the analyzes are 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.870
 physical-chemical quality control of milk 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.009
 and ten dairy products and derivatives 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.729
 So we're doing it right now in the network. 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.759
 and quality control no receipt analysis of the reader 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.909
 during the course these students are trained to do all the 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:22.709
 reviews 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.310
 and quality control and anarchists who wore the rest of the team 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.579
 lack of derivative products 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.759
 but the benefits of this analysis 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.500
 the benefit is here 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 them an impression or in any research project that has a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.189
 milk quality viewing collection 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.180
 Cecilia who would actually be complying with the standards in force in force 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.109
 in the country 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.500
 the goal is this 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.809
 liquidity and ensure the peace of law 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.219
 every company has to have this professional to do this analysis 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.929
 is the correct one for the pt must have a qualified partner 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:58.319
 with this it is serious in the law that exempts of physical-chemical logics 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.569
 so that he can guarantee this quality is a qualified person who 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.649
 This is the most important 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:09.779
 the course has existed since 2006 and works on the campus of satuba 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:14.260
 the duration is three and a half years in the last period students should 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:20.370
 do pccr and internship the netherlands is finishing tcc and already interned it goes 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.479
 present the research at the food science and technology congress in 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.669
 Salvador the student is excited about the arrival in the job market is this 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.960
 that I wanted this is what I'm going to try life on the road I lived here forward 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.659
 the room 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.370
 work and learn more and more
