00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.660
 more for him 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.560
 that is a death by hanging not 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.030
 that's why, because of your comments 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
 which costs favorite death because the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580
