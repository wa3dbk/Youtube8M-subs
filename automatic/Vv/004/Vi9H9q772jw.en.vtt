00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.380 
sure you understand this is you will not
be<00:02:55.590> getting<00:02:55.740> any<00:02:56.040> gear<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.270> going

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390

from<00:02:57.630> 90<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.050> 100<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> only<00:02:59.040> thing<00:02:59.160> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
from 90 to 100 but the only thing you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.430 
from 90 to 100 but the only thing you
will<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.550> doing<00:02:59.820> is<00:03:00.150> killing<00:03:00.420> ads<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.350> you

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
will be doing is killing ads so you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.740 
will be doing is killing ads so you
won't<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.980> see<00:03:02.250> any<00:03:02.490> loot<00:03:02.820> drops<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.360> may

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
won't have see any loot drops so may

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
won't have see any loot drops so may
keep<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.110> mind<00:03:04.380> when<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.710> hit<00:03:04.890> 100<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:05.880> feel

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
keep in mind when you hit 100 you feel

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.240 
keep in mind when you hit 100 you feel
like<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.630> same<00:03:06.870> item<00:03:07.200> level<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.530> were<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.830> 90

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
like the same item level you were as 90

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.800 
like the same item level you were as 90
so<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> little<00:03:08.850> bit<00:03:09.090> bad<00:03:09.300> unless<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
so it is a little bit bad unless you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.450 
so it is a little bit bad unless you
have<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> money<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.380> buy<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.740> stuff<00:03:10.980> but

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
have the money to buy that stuff but

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.370 
have the money to buy that stuff but
with<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> Newton<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.450> jungle<00:03:12.900> guys<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.230> does

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
with the Newton and jungle guys it does

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.140 
with the Newton and jungle guys it does
make<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.740> lot<00:03:13.980> easier<00:03:14.040> there's<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.730> lot<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
make this a lot easier there's a lot of

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.540 
make this a lot easier there's a lot of
650<00:03:15.960> gear<00:03:16.200> there<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:17.010> pick<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.310> that's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
650 gear there you can pick up that's

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.970 
650 gear there you can pick up that's
the<00:03:17.700> base<00:03:17.940> gear<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.630> 675<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.560> think

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the base gear you can get 675 I think

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.700 
the base gear you can get 675 I think
you<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.310> 695<00:03:21.300> honestly<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.440> that's

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
you can get 695 honestly I think that's

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.190 
you can get 695 honestly I think that's
empowered<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.700> kind<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:24.000> like<00:03:24.060> time<00:03:24.840> style

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
empowered it's kind of like time style

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.380 
empowered it's kind of like time style
so<00:03:25.710> yeah<00:03:25.890> guys<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.550> definitely<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.240> way

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
so yeah guys this is definitely the way

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.450 
so yeah guys this is definitely the way
to<00:03:27.420> go<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.780> believe<00:03:28.350> because<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:29.010> Newton<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
to go I believe because the Newton and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.910 
to go I believe because the Newton and
jungle<00:03:29.910> there's<00:03:30.300> not<00:03:30.420> many<00:03:30.570> cons<00:03:30.990> obviously

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
jungle there's not many cons obviously

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.410 
jungle there's not many cons obviously
if<00:03:31.980> your<00:03:32.100> lines<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.520> got<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> run<00:03:32.880> really<00:03:33.210> far

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
if your lines you got to run really far

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.060 
if your lines you got to run really far
and<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.600> your<00:03:33.720> non<00:03:33.990> AoE<00:03:34.260> classes<00:03:34.770> might<00:03:34.920> be

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
and if your non AoE classes might be

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.430 
and if your non AoE classes might be
pretty<00:03:35.520> difficult<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.720> if<00:03:36.780> your<00:03:36.900> Navy<00:03:37.230> class

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
pretty difficult but if your Navy class

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.650 
pretty difficult but if your Navy class
guys<00:03:37.680> definitely<00:03:38.100> go<00:03:38.550> for<00:03:38.580> this<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
guys definitely go for this this is the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.320 
guys definitely go for this this is the
fastest<00:03:40.320> way<00:03:40.350> from<00:03:40.560> 90<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.070> 100<00:03:41.550> possible<00:03:42.030> you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
fastest way from 90 to 100 possible you

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.450 
fastest way from 90 to 100 possible you
can<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.720> honestly<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.710> when<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> do<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
can get honestly out when I do this I

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.070 
can get honestly out when I do this I
got<00:03:44.640> three<00:03:44.880> levels<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.390> little<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:45.870> under

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
got three levels and a little bit under

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.500 
got three levels and a little bit under
an<00:03:46.200> hour<00:03:46.380> which<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.880> Warlock<00:03:48.270> so

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
an hour which I was on the Warlock so

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.510 
an hour which I was on the Warlock so
obviously<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.140> little<00:03:49.380> bit<00:03:49.470> easier<00:03:49.860> but

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
obviously it's a little bit easier but

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.610 
obviously it's a little bit easier but
honestly<00:03:51.390> guys<00:03:51.540> anyone<00:03:52.020> can<00:03:52.200> do<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.440> I
