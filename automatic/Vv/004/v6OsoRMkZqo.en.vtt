00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 so welcome to a small family 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.080
 deck preview you get right today 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.880
 In short, I just want you to do that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.389
 offer deck for download 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.080
 and yes , I'm up to it right now 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.270
 space 3 of the apartment was fought round 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.400
 so last fourth in a cup 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.869
 unfortunately there were evans from prophecy and 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.550
 dragonball is currently ranked 13th 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:40.680
 Unfortunately, storm was my opponent in the game 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 Anyway, yes, what am I supposed to do? 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.059
 Great for the deck, many say 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.829
 know it a bit like this 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 toronto has mobilized similar version 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:01.590
 cards Cavalli twice debris three times 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.239
 and dandelion lion once that we 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.309
 can contact us here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 because we eat it here with rap 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.210
 not a good three now 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 different ones come or just 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 dandelion good combinations are too 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.090
 Debris dragon with dandelion lion 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.310
 that's just so easy 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.729
 The switch combination around the black 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 to get red kites 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.280
 I have to say this course I have one 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:43.049
 bit accepted cadaster if I'm in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.530
 of course, two bogeys 236 done yes, though 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.579
 I have to say the synchro goes 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 actually think about red jewels 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 I'll stop for a bit if I will 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:03.240
 do not worry about anything else or 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:05.159
 or dragon must be one-sided 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.700
 Personally , I like it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.519
 every case very well I have powers 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.769
 royally rob all empty age 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.840
 chains disappear would disappear 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.110
 I play against kite units and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.950
 requires getting rid of because if i am now 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.440
 times the upper right corner we see the search 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.330
 500 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.920
 currently I will also chain 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.530
 disappear against other drummers 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.769
 play because it would be less than exit 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.410
 as a receiver monster less attika that 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:48.489
 1000 the theme of the dragon is also included 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:54.060
 1000 ksk is also at 800 and effect 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.060
 because as well as zero 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.660
 That's why you can ever do this 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.569
 big brother from the new because of well 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.190
 turn off quite fast and that 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.209
 moves because of or even tackles 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.209
 just teach vanity 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:18.250
 I personally find that the whole I 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.989
 not bad i think that it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.019
 Good chances continue to be good 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.010
 continue to mess around a bit off 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.170
 especially for example in something like mst 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.190
 Teaching is certainly one of the many 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.190
 to change a bit 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:44.200
 but by the way totally first 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.360
 sorry that I'm trying hard me 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.900
 I really wanted to offer the deck 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.769
 but still I'm dead tired 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.049
 That's why I'm talking right now 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.650
 a bit slower and a bit 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.239
 quiet 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.049
 I hope you do not take that too much 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.120
 In any case, that is bad 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.760
 has been three times three times three times 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.359
 Measure up to three times redox twice 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.599
 The issue of Qatar is an overpayment 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:12.609
 mexico sk once-effect because once 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.639
 World Week together is a snap 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.560
 we can do kostroma dragon and environment 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.039
 use and throw off and cards 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.150
 pull 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.280
 Blessed are we twelve 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.710
 Sacrifice for me, what should happen 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.410
 I think his gold sarcophagus is in there 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.120
 is good we get two leaked that 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.120
 so visit the dragon the 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.909
 and at the same time get the 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.219
 So we cat over for example 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.619
 Deliver blaster through gold sarcophagus 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.069
 can we look for new blaster or 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:49.929
 Filmwelt Wache Zurich is the funeral 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.399
 he said as another consideration whether 

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:54.219
 she does not change foolishness 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.829
 Definitely for lions pay for or 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.089
 for a brother because of me just yet 

00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:01.179
 not in the game 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:05.349
 that is called such blaster cemetery tempus 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:07.029
 then also on the cemetery and me 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.919
 I already dandelion on the cemetery of 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:12.459
 pulling is obedient then I do not send 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.649
 no matter in the cemetery dragon canyon 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:24.729
 why not exactly the same principle 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:27.659
 about foolish i can just do that 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.969
 monster each kick to the cemetery 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:34.839
 or just give me a kiss sk on the hand 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:37.239
 get king wings have many 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.399
 rule-breakers overweight as little wing 

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:40.719
 because with some cards it is me 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.669
 actually it does not matter in the 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.289
 next round again draws on every 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.289
 case he has to pull it out of the 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:51.429
 kick of his deck is mixed because of that 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:54.479
 for me already ideal star dust 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:59.229
 works a lot better too 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.269
 the crushers and the like for nothing 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.619
 wing my choice and as a scapegoat 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:08.229
 serious warning unabridged other things like that 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:09.449
 That 's it it was for the deck I hope 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.639
 you will 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:15.749
 have a lot of fun with builds 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.459
 a bit at will 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.899
 I 'm looking forward to it in the esl 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.299
 to compete against me 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:24.279
 I will download the covers this time 

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:27.579

 a little bit to a bit 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.320
 a little bit quiet 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.530
