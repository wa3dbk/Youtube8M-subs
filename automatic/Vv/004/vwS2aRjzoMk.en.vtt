00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.630
 new in the description of the video in the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.630
 downstairs 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.809

 and we hope we can install 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.390
 ask what is the most effective we give 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.140
 if you know what program works and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 let's see yes 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.050
 and finish 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.510
 in our pc let's start we 're going to 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 all the programs and we give it to be here 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.940
 in the folder x live besseling we activate 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 we must make sure that the fried 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 been as well as I have it works 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 perfectly 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.140
 We are in position 31 415 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.789
 there is a way much more bag and open it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.940
 I do it because I have access to me 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.490
 move 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.259
 but 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.240
 [Music] 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.549
 7 of a TV depends on the company 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.910
 simply call the company and ask 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.520
 favors and you can open port 31 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.560
 415 that is you are going to use a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.230
 software that allows you to play games in 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.050
 line then 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.510
 they can open it with an ep protocol and 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.069
 it makes you better and friends 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.130
 and with that you do not trust yourself 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.940
 opening it but they do him the favor 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.940
 do not 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.260
 Port 31 415 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 not just a yacht 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.840
 my father 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.680
 and we give him record 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.970
 ah 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.970
 this there is marked 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.090
 port to 31 415 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 as I say the easiest if you 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.860
 They call directly to the company and has 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.900
 because they do it with pleasure 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 they do it without any inconvenience 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.819
 Port 31 415 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.209
 here we enter the brand number 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.209
 the euros 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.080
 let's look at 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.290
 noticing the various actions in several 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.290
 license plates 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.619
 [Music] 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.880
 to find it in the console then 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.920
 I would be insane 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.570
 we turn on the emotion place the fire 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.340
 inside then we press the button and 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.340
 we go down to where it says more 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.000
 there is 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the program 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.419
 [Music] 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.850
 already having the brand number 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.750
 then no 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.470
 0 0 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 but 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.310
 sorry 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.720
 mate 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.090
 but in the hand 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:50.870
 it is different we goleamos here in adding and he 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.870
 it will not go to the numbers sometimes 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.450
 we should take this chulito like that in the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.450
 same way as I have it 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.179
 and then we give him to be in him 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.190
 we hope the program 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.670
 arenas then well be by now a 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.900
 little people who can 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:30.190
 went to the connection programs with 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.009
 we are served 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.729
 should post hotels message 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.340
 then because it forces them to a 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.810
 population of lost 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.220
 this program connects directly 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.220
 from your pc 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.850
 then we give him there we enter the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.680
 sand of tÃ©lam we click to him that lay 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.620
 alone and then we give it down here where 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.550
 says genius and create and we enter the arenal 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.550
 here it is 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.660
 or if we want we do not create we're going to end 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.400
 where the sand of both in club we talked 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.800
 in the b 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.780
 and here we write 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.990
 and we even write how we want it to be 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.370
 I called 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.760
 let it be called the sand 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:29.500
 let's not say ours is a 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.500
 and let's read the number of users 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.940
 but between art and our life 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.199
 let's check and here is my arena 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.969
