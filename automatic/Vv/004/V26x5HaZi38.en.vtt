00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.660
 people are not so good that they are 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.639
 welcome here this new video and 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.980
 well then I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.750
 revolution with enough information 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.790
 important for those people in which 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.770
 Enjoy this title and it's that good 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.950
 December 10 is going to present the 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.950
 update number 1.0 3 for playstation 3 and 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.270
 the 1.0 2 for xbox 360 and well then to 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.219
 then the details are good 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.770
 about what this brings 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.140
 corrective patch do not get excited not 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.879
 brings corrective for the counterattack ok 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.309
 then let's start with the adjustments 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.660
 in the balance of the game and good the 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.970
 behavior of the characters of 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 support after unleashing the last 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.390
 youtube is going to adjust apparently some 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.329
 problem with behavior at the time 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.940
 so let's say you stop guessing what 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.100
 the animation probably not the consumption 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.079
 of the last jutsu and copp farm 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.210
 ultimate u2 is going to be adjusted I do not know if 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.570
 will consume more or less I hope more 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.909
 and good the behavior of some 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.680
 ninjutsu with fall effects at the time 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.780
 to use when provoking a 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.549
 ring out is going to be adjusted on 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.679
 behavior of the car brings when the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.930
 storm bar meter goes on 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.670
 maximum to zero is going to adjust 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 it is necessary to farm to activate the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.410
 support drive 2 fits here I do not know if 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.180
 they will get more or less OK 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.740
 time behavior of type of 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.330
 reinforcement when all the characters in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.310
 support are defeated with the meter 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.570
 Storm to the max fits this 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.130
 means the time that they will take in 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.660
 return the supports once they are 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.630
 defeated as long as your bar 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.369
 storm is at maximum effect 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.530
 of the bersa of the true awakening of 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.660
 boy is going to be adjusted the time in the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.880
 that the rival is unconscious for a 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.830
 knockout is going to adjust and obviously this 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.660
 nothing else is based on blows in what 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.570
 is the defense does not include neither the guard nor 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.610
 the counter ok the opponent will shoot 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.649
 if it is hit when a guard is made 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.910
 break and is unconscious if you apply 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.430
 in a guard break and you get to do a 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.280
 combo is going to get fired that should 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.619
 to do with the counter but good ok 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.869
 for the type of last use the effect of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.640
 the definitive combination between and noise 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.739
 and camargo was going to be adjusted apparently 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 they will add a little more damage ok 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.070
 the land combo or the combo is work 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.620
 of those that of the ultimate 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.720
 manikkalingam is going to be adjusted 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.209
 for the drive tape the behavior of the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.549
 adversary that is replaced in support 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.750
 that combined during that during the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.640
 attack unit that is I mean 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.220
 while you are attacking with the element 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.540
 of attack action and is replaced then 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.370
 now the enemy is going to change it 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.659
 that seems good to me I hope that what 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.610
 fix because if it is quite annoying 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.349
 with multiple characters the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.989
 behavior after replacing the 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.860
 combo towards the ground is going to adjust 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.470
 obviously apparently an error too 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.090
 similar in that aspect ok the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.099
 behavior of the characters of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.989
 puppets while activating the ultimate u2 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.120
 is going to be adjusted here if I do not have like 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.099
 that a lot of notion about what it will be and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.599
 correction of the modes a problem with 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.069
 the episode of mk naruto is going to be 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.920
 adjusted and behavior in the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.200
 obtaining from the orb of last am the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.970
 waking hero is going to adjust and they're going to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.730
 make adjustments in movement problems 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.599
 ok then good band these are the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.459
 patch notes 1.02 on xbox and 1.03 on 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.079
 playstation3 and well then obviously 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.579
 when the log is made that they are going to 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.290
 details and about 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.120
 changes that were really made in what 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.920
 which is the game not until then 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.109
 Well, I can not tell you much 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 and I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.629

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
 they fixed the counter 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.250
 but they are patching well 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.959
 we have hope we have hope of 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.280
