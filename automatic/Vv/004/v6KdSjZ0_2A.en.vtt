 no input 2 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.460
 yes he completely replaces the regime but 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 it may mean need

 also relatively small 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.530
 color quality will be 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.940
 enough for everyday tasks 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.110
