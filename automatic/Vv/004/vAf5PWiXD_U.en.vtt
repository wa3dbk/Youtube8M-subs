00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.170 
built like it so what that means is
those<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.040> RAM<00:01:56.310> all<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:56.970> there's<00:01:57.150> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
those a lot more RAM all right there's a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
those a lot more RAM all right there's a
lot<00:01:57.300> more<00:01:57.330> RAM<00:01:57.660> on<00:01:57.690> these<00:01:58.110> new<00:01:58.230> consoles<00:01:58.770> which

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
lot more RAM on these new consoles which

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.460 
lot more RAM on these new consoles which
means<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.940> know<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.480> faster<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.350> do

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
means you know it's faster it can do

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
means you know it's faster it can do
more<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.100> big<00:02:02.610> reason<00:02:02.850> why<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> PlayStation

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
more a big reason why the PlayStation

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.359 
more a big reason why the PlayStation
didn't<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.640> xbox<00:02:06.300> midnight<00:02:06.960> xbox<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.010> chat

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
didn't have xbox midnight xbox but chat

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.889 
didn't have xbox midnight xbox but chat
the<00:02:08.910> reason<00:02:09.119> why<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.240> PlayStation<00:02:09.720> didn't

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the reason why the PlayStation didn't

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.230 
the reason why the PlayStation didn't
have<00:02:09.990> chat<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.980> new<00:02:11.100> xbox<00:02:11.640> will

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
have chat is because the new xbox will

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.420 
have chat is because the new xbox will
not<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> old<00:02:12.690> xbox<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.590> old<00:02:13.740> xbox<00:02:14.040> had<00:02:14.400> more

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
not the old xbox the old xbox had more

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.600 
not the old xbox the old xbox had more
RAM<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.510> PlayStation<00:02:16.290> 3<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:17.310> why<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
RAM and PlayStation 3 that's why the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.670 
RAM and PlayStation 3 that's why the
playstation<00:02:18.300> 3<00:02:18.660> couldn't<00:02:18.990> have<00:02:19.080> chat<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
playstation 3 couldn't have chat and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.730 
playstation 3 couldn't have chat and
xbox<00:02:20.160> 360<00:02:20.730> did<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> same<00:02:22.020> ram<00:02:22.380> but

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
xbox 360 did they have the same ram but

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.920 
xbox 360 did they have the same ram but
the<00:02:22.890> PlayStation<00:02:23.640> did<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:24.120> split<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.750> rent

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the PlayStation did they split the rent

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.620 
the PlayStation did they split the rent
went<00:02:25.110> away<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.620> different<00:02:26.130> things<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.330> guess

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
went away two different things I guess

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.860 
went away two different things I guess
and<00:02:28.340> Xbox<00:02:29.340> kept<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> has<00:02:29.880> one<00:02:30.150> really<00:02:30.660> hard

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
and Xbox kept it has one really hard

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.090 
and Xbox kept it has one really hard
killer<00:02:31.140> drone<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:32.550> had<00:02:32.820> more<00:02:33.590> RAM<00:02:34.590> all

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
killer drone they had more RAM all

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.620 
killer drone they had more RAM all
together<00:02:35.430> they<00:02:35.970> splitting<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.780> into<00:02:37.459> so

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
together they splitting it up into so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.360 
together they splitting it up into so
what<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.780> did<00:02:39.989> was<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.070> was<00:02:41.130> more

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
what that did was you know it was more

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.460 
what that did was you know it was more
RAM<00:02:41.580> technically<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.690> uh<00:02:42.750> these<00:02:43.260> new

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
RAM technically but uh these new

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.040

question<00:03:14.070> depending<00:03:15.070> what<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.220> price<00:03:15.550> is

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
question depending what the price is

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.600 
question depending what the price is
because<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> PlayStation<00:03:16.660> 3<00:03:16.900> was<00:03:17.110> no<00:03:17.410> 600<00:03:18.130> so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
because the PlayStation 3 was no 600 so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.060 
because the PlayStation 3 was no 600 so
seven<00:03:19.300> hundred<00:03:19.540> dollars<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:20.200> was<00:03:20.320> pretty

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
seven hundred dollars that was pretty

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.970 
seven hundred dollars that was pretty
expensive<00:03:21.640> now<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.900> know<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> lot<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:23.920> guys
