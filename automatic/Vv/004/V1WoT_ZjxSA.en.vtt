00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780 

that<00:00:00.750> we<00:00:00.930> were<00:00:01.110> finishing<00:00:02.100> up<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.550> class<00:00:03.650> so<00:00:04.790> we

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
that we were finishing up in class so we

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.570 
that we were finishing up in class so we
had<00:00:05.910> just<00:00:06.120> talked<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.400> let's<00:00:08.400> go

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
had just talked about the right let's go

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:20.630 
had just talked about the right let's go
over<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:18.350> what<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.770> wavelength<00:00:20.039> in

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
over this what is the wavelength in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.630 
over this what is the wavelength in
nanometers<00:00:20.960> of<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.170> true<00:00:22.350> ultraviolet<00:00:23.220> light

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
nanometers of all true ultraviolet light

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
nanometers of all true ultraviolet light
in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> Balmer<00:00:24.390> series<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> Balmer

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
in the Balmer series so the Balmer

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.689 
in the Balmer series so the Balmer
series<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.820> n2<00:00:27.539> equals<00:00:28.080> 2<00:00:28.490> corresponding<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
series is n2 equals 2 corresponding to a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.350 
series is n2 equals 2 corresponding to a
value<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> n1<00:00:30.869> equals<00:00:31.740> 70<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.820> enter<00:00:33.180> your

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
value of n1 equals 70 so enter your

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
value of n1 equals 70 so enter your
answer<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> 3<00:00:34.140> signals<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.430> let's<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.820> ahead

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
answer to 3 signals so let's go ahead

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
answer to 3 signals so let's go ahead
and<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.320> problem<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:40.410> course<00:00:40.649> first

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and do this problem so of course first

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.660 
and do this problem so of course first
you<00:00:41.160> gotta<00:00:41.399> remember<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.420> Rydberg<00:00:42.870> equation

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
you gotta remember the Rydberg equation

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.959 
you gotta remember the Rydberg equation
so<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.149> worn<00:00:45.420> over<00:00:45.600> wavelength

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.340 

times

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:03.880 

and<00:00:53.739> 2<00:00:54.430> square<00:00:55.650> minus<00:00:56.650> 1<00:00:57.250> over<00:00:57.900> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.610 

you<00:01:04.400> also<00:01:04.550> know<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.030> Rydberg<00:01:05.510> constant<00:01:08.620> and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
you also know the Rydberg constant and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:25.679 
you also know the Rydberg constant and
what<00:01:09.950> they<00:01:10.100> give<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.520> they<00:01:11.390> give<00:01:11.600> you

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:37.730 

so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.910 

so<00:01:38.190> remember<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.820> per<00:01:39.120> meters<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.920> divided

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so remember that per meters is divided

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:56.030 
so remember that per meters is divided
by<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.310> meter<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:09.180 

upstate<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> meaner<00:01:57.120> down

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:23.070 

so<00:02:09.730> m2<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.350> dance

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.630 

so<00:02:23.590> everybody<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.070> able<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.760> there

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so everybody was able to get to there

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.050 
so everybody was able to get to there
and<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:27.970> let's<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:28.990> continue<00:02:29.170> along

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
and then let's just continue along

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:48.059 
and then let's just continue along
because<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.300> think<00:02:31.360> people<00:02:31.690> had<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.080> hard<00:02:32.200> time

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.479 

so<00:02:48.640> solve<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.420> portion<00:02:50.140> first<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.010> then

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
so solve this portion first and then

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.990 
so solve this portion first and then
multiply<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.150> by<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.480> portion

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.710 

so

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.170 

and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.260> multiplies<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.820> point

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and then multiplies have one point

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:25.800 
and then multiplies have one point
though

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.380 

okay<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.500> when<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.800> get<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.220> when<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.550> do<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:29.000> I

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
okay so when I get that when I do that I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.800 
okay so when I get that when I do that I
get<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.680> answer<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:33.640> 0.5

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.059 

times<00:03:39.440> 10<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.190> 1<00:03:40.610> 2<00:03:41.390> 3<00:03:41.840> 4<00:03:42.350> 5<00:03:42.800> 6<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.500> that's<00:03:45.650> 6

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
times 10 to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that's 6

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.449 
times 10 to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that's 6
and<00:03:46.850> notice<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.690> meters<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.319> still<00:03:48.590> down<00:03:48.800> here

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
and notice the meters is still down here

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:58.540 
and notice the meters is still down here
right<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.120> still

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.130 

so<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.900> per<00:04:00.350> meter<00:04:01.300> independent<00:04:02.300> this<00:04:02.570> right

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
so this per meter independent this right

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.910 
so this per meter independent this right
so<00:04:03.440> where<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:04.430> gives<00:04:05.180> us<00:04:05.470> one<00:04:06.470> over<00:04:06.830> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
so where this gives us one over the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.740 
so where this gives us one over the
wavelength<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:07.580> we<00:04:07.760> want<00:04:07.970> wavelength<00:04:08.540> so

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
wavelength so we want wavelength so

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.110 
wavelength so we want wavelength so
we're<00:04:08.900> going<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.230> take<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.430> flip<00:04:11.090> it

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
we're going to take this and flip it

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:19.330 
we're going to take this and flip it
over<00:04:16.150> take<00:04:17.150> one<00:04:17.450> meter<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.020> divided<00:04:18.530> by<00:04:18.709> two

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
over take one meter and divided by two

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.409 
over take one meter and divided by two
point<00:04:19.640> five<00:04:19.880> two<00:04:20.239> times<00:04:20.630> ten<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.170> the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.709 

and<00:04:27.539> so<00:04:27.960> wavelength<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.919> course<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:30.270> going<00:04:30.569> to

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
and so wavelength of course is going to

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:41.770 
and so wavelength of course is going to
be<00:04:31.249> one<00:04:32.249> meter<00:04:32.840> divided<00:04:33.840> by<00:04:34.939> 2.5<00:04:35.939> to

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.600 

when<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.930> do<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.320> just<00:04:42.380> take<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:43.100> divided<00:04:43.580> by

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
when I do that just take one divided by

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.390 
when I do that just take one divided by
second<00:04:44.210> hand

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.409 

3.97<00:04:52.099> to<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.220> negative<00:04:53.669> seven<00:04:54.530> meters<00:04:55.530> okay

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
3.97 to the negative seven meters okay

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.779 
3.97 to the negative seven meters okay
this<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:57.539> everybody<00:04:57.870> cool<00:04:58.110> there<00:04:58.379> but<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.490> says

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
this is everybody cool there but it says

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.890 
this is everybody cool there but it says
to<00:05:00.030> do<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.449> nanometers<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:02.569> in<00:05:03.569> order<00:05:03.719> to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
to do it in nanometers so in order to

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.899 
to do it in nanometers so in order to
convert<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:04.469> command<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:05.400> got<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.669> remember

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
convert this command we got to remember

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.520 
convert this command we got to remember
the<00:05:06.210> conversion<00:05:06.689> factor<00:05:09.169> gave<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.319> to<00:05:10.439> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
the conversion factor gave it to you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.880 
the conversion factor gave it to you
guys<00:05:10.680> earlier<00:05:12.439> times

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:24.920 

meters<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:17.580> one<00:05:17.940> animator

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930
