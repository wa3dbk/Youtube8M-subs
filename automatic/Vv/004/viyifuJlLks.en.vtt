today<00:00:29.580> are<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:29.970> some<00:00:30.770> examples<00:00:31.770> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
today are just some examples of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
today are just some examples of

or with gym equipment to mix it up a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280 
or with gym equipment to mix it up a
little<00:00:36.720> bit<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> first<00:00:39.390> exercise<00:00:39.720> I'm<00:00:40.140> going

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
little bit the first exercise I'm going

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.430 
little bit the first exercise I'm going
to<00:00:40.350> show<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> side<00:00:41.910> plank<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:43.260> might

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to show you is a side plank you might

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.840 
to show you is a side plank you might
recognize<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.489> yoga<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:46.020> pilates

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
recognize this from yoga or pilates

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.830 
recognize this from yoga or pilates
we're<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we're gonna do it with a little bit of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.010 
we're gonna do it with a little bit of
modification<00:00:49.170> using<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> roller<00:00:50.430> it

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
modification using the roller it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
modification using the roller it
increases<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.320> instability<00:00:53.190> factor<00:00:53.670> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
increases the instability factor so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
increases the instability factor so
there's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.570> work<00:00:54.780> involved<00:00:55.070> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
there's a little more work involved so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
there's a little more work involved so
I'm<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.309> start<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.879> knees<00:00:57.270> bent<00:00:58.010> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this position now just holding the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.260 
this position now just holding the
position<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.459> work<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.689> lower<00:01:10.679> and

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
raise up with the roller you can keep

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.330

your<00:01:16.679> shoulder<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.909> over<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> elbow

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
your shoulder right over the elbow

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.889 
your shoulder right over the elbow
without<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> roller<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.209> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.719> move

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
without the roller you do have to move

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.599 
without the roller you do have to move
up<00:01:22.109> and<00:01:22.319> down<00:01:22.439> over<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.859> elbow<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.189> bit

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
up and down over the elbow a little bit

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.999 
up and down over the elbow a little bit
so<00:01:24.569> you<00:01:24.630> only<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.319> few<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.829> each<00:01:25.979> side<00:01:28.009> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
so you only need a few on each side to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.599 
so you only need a few on each side to
make<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.459> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.670> harder<00:01:32.929> we<00:01:33.929> can<00:01:34.139> go<00:01:34.319> to

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
make it a little harder we can go to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.370 
make it a little harder we can go to
full<00:01:35.609> length<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.959> little<00:01:37.200> more

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
full length just a little more

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.859 
full length just a little more
resistance<00:01:38.039> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.090> elbow<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.749> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.859> hand

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.109 

okay<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:45.500> again<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:46.310> can<00:01:46.729> do<00:01:47.000> some<00:01:47.960> dips<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:49.119> can

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
okay so again I can do some dips you can

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.130 
okay so again I can do some dips you can
also<00:01:50.560> raise<00:01:51.560> one<00:01:51.890> arm<00:01:51.920> up<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.850> by<00:01:53.479> looking<00:01:53.929> up

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
also raise one arm up and by looking up

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.450 
also raise one arm up and by looking up
towards<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.619> ceiling

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
towards the ceiling

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.219 
towards the ceiling
losing<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> horizon<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.840> little<00:01:57.079> more

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
losing the horizon it's a little more

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.969 
losing the horizon it's a little more
challenging<00:01:57.859> to<00:01:57.920> balance<00:01:59.079> you<00:02:00.079> can<00:02:00.259> also<00:02:00.469> add

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
challenging to balance you can also add

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.919 
challenging to balance you can also add
a<00:02:01.549> leg<00:02:02.149> raise<00:02:03.310> if<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.549> do<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> leg<00:02:05.090> raise<00:02:05.360> with

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
a leg raise if you do the leg raise with

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.789 
a leg raise if you do the leg raise with
the<00:02:06.200> dip<00:02:06.469> that's<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.250> same<00:02:07.490> time<00:02:08.799> you're

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
the dip that's the same time you're

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.729 
the dip that's the same time you're
asking<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.369> trouble<00:02:14.319> alright<00:02:15.319> now<00:02:15.470> I'm<00:02:15.590> gonna

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
asking for trouble alright now I'm gonna

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.520 
asking for trouble alright now I'm gonna
show<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.250> couple<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:17.140> different<00:02:18.140> types<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
show you a couple of different types of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.220 
show you a couple of different types of
exercises<00:02:19.040> combining<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.150> arms<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.630> legs<00:02:20.870> or

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
exercises combining the arms and legs or

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.520 
exercises combining the arms and legs or
using<00:02:21.799> them<00:02:21.950> individually<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.319> use

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
using them individually and you can use

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.960 
using them individually and you can use
different<00:02:24.769> kinds<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.190> equipment<00:02:25.610> for<00:02:25.790> this

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
different kinds of equipment for this

different kinds of equipment for this
ideally<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.079> would<00:02:27.170> use<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.380> cable<00:02:27.829> crossover

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
ideally you would use a cable crossover

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.610 
ideally you would use a cable crossover
at<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:28.910> gym<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.420> don't<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.079> one<00:02:30.290> here<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.590> my

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
at your gym I don't have one here in my

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.280 
at your gym I don't have one here in my
little<00:02:30.860> clinic<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.579> I'm<00:02:31.970> making<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
little clinic so I'm making do with a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.170 
little clinic so I'm making do with a
pulley<00:02:33.500> machine<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.160> some<00:02:34.459> resistive<00:02:34.970> band

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
pulley machine and some resistive band

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.869 
pulley machine and some resistive band
you<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.840> also<00:02:36.079> just<00:02:36.530> use<00:02:36.620> resistive<00:02:37.250> bands<00:02:37.489> at

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
you can also just use resistive bands at

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.110 
you can also just use resistive bands at
home<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.590> buy<00:02:39.739> them<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.340> individual

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
home and you can buy them in individual

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.119 
home and you can buy them in individual
packets<00:02:41.540> online<00:02:42.049> or<00:02:42.440> go<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.769> your<00:02:42.950> physical

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
packets online or go to your physical

therapist and it would cost about $1 a
foot<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:47.239> them<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.660> cut<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> piece<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:49.010> I'm

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
foot for them to cut you a piece so I'm

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.819 
foot for them to cut you a piece so I'm
going<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.250> start<00:02:49.459> with<00:02:49.840> leg<00:02:50.840> exercises<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.769> I

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
going to start with leg exercises and I

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.789 
going to start with leg exercises and I
have<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.069> resistive<00:02:52.790> band<00:02:53.000> here<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.620> can

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
have a resistive band here and you can

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.050 
have a resistive band here and you can
have<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.100> attached<00:02:55.430> into<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:57.069> doorway<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.940> the

okay<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.240> reverse<00:03:20.450> as<00:03:20.990> well

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
okay I can do it in reverse as well

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
okay I can do it in reverse as well
again<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.780> same<00:03:23.990> stance<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:26.500> pushing

okay<00:03:34.300> now<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:35.800> gonna<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.250> some<00:03:36.550> things<00:03:37.180> with

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
okay now I'm gonna do some things with

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.890 
okay now I'm gonna do some things with
the<00:03:37.629> arms<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.500> can<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.950> two<00:03:39.400> or<00:03:39.730> one<00:03:40.120> arm<00:03:40.420> at<00:03:40.840> a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the arms you can do two or one arm at a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.250 
the arms you can do two or one arm at a
time

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
time

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.580 
time
I'm<00:03:41.950> gonna<00:03:42.159> use<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:42.670> arm<00:03:42.849> I'm<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.959> just

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
I'm gonna use one arm I'm going to just

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.830 
I'm gonna use one arm I'm going to just
raise<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.580> one<00:03:45.760> leg<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.299> have<00:03:46.510> attached

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
raise the one leg that I have attached

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.990 
raise the one leg that I have attached
to<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.170> band<00:03:47.379> just<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.920> kind<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.909> out

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
to the band just to kind of get it out

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.539 
to the band just to kind of get it out
of<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.239> way<00:03:49.390> I'm<00:03:50.049> going<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.470> be<00:03:50.590> working<00:03:51.220> my

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
of the way I'm going to be working my

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.699 
of the way I'm going to be working my
again<00:03:52.000> my<00:03:52.030> supporting<00:03:52.750> leg<00:03:52.810> balancing

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
again my supporting leg balancing

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.690 
again my supporting leg balancing
against<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:55.060> resistance<00:03:55.629> from<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.200> arm<00:03:59.700> okay

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
against the resistance from the arm okay

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.520 
against the resistance from the arm okay
now<00:04:00.879> I<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:01.209> use<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.989> two<00:04:02.230> together<00:04:04.409> so<00:04:05.409> this

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
now I can use the two together so this

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.839 
now I can use the two together so this
is<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.650> great<00:04:05.799> for<00:04:06.010> cross-country<00:04:06.340> skiing

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
is a great for cross-country skiing

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.559 
is a great for cross-country skiing
obviously<00:04:07.540> again<00:04:08.019> I'm<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.530> my<00:04:09.329> slightly<00:04:10.329> bent

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
obviously again I'm in my slightly bent

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.880 
obviously again I'm in my slightly bent
knee<00:04:11.230> position<00:04:12.239> stomach<00:04:13.239> tight<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:14.109> I<00:04:14.650> get

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
knee position stomach tight and I get

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.890 
knee position stomach tight and I get
back<00:04:15.040> with<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> Ironmen<00:04:15.849> board<00:04:16.209> with<00:04:16.419> leg<00:04:16.720> at

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
back with the Ironmen board with leg at

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.260 
back with the Ironmen board with leg at
the<00:04:16.930> same<00:04:17.079> time

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.900 

okay<00:04:24.810> now<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.199> reversed<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.580> I'm<00:04:26.699> going

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
okay now I just reversed it so I'm going

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.790 
okay now I just reversed it so I'm going
to<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.060> pulling<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.539> band<00:04:27.750> back<00:04:28.080> with<00:04:28.349> my<00:04:28.560> leg

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
to be pulling the band back with my leg

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.640 
to be pulling the band back with my leg
and<00:04:29.130> forward<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.509> arms<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.199> again<00:04:31.470> I'm

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and forward with the arms so again I'm

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:44.070 
and forward with the arms so again I'm
on<00:04:31.860> my<00:04:32.069> supporting<00:04:32.520> leg<00:04:32.580> pulled<00:04:33.449> in<00:04:33.690> here
