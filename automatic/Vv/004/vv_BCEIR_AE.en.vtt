00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a little bit out date now so I thought

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
a little bit out date now so I thought
I'd<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.689> back<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.200> say<00:01:28.500> about<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.890> stuff

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'd we go back and say about some stuff

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399 
I'd we go back and say about some stuff
so<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.170> mood

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
so I'm actually the really good mood

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
so I'm actually the really good mood
today<00:01:31.590> I've<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.090> sheer<00:01:33.600> hell<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.170> an

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
today I've just had a sheer hell in an

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.130 
today I've just had a sheer hell in an
exam<00:01:34.770> chemistry<00:01:35.729> exam<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.659> live<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
exam chemistry exam if you live in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.330 
exam chemistry exam if you live in the
UK<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.619> doing<00:01:37.770> a-levels<00:01:37.860> it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
UK and you're doing a-levels it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390 
UK and you're doing a-levels it's
chemistry<00:01:38.670> unit<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.439> if<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.979> makes<00:01:41.220> any

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
chemistry unit two if that makes any

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.810 
chemistry unit two if that makes any
sense<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> AQA<00:01:42.509> example<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.200> anyway

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
sense on the AQA example but anyway

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.740 
sense on the AQA example but anyway
basically<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> need<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.479> lasts

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
basically all I need to know it lasts

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.649 
basically all I need to know it lasts
almost<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.170> hours<00:01:46.530> 1<00:01:46.799> hour<00:01:46.829> 45<00:01:47.490> minutes<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
almost two hours 1 hour 45 minutes it is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.920 
almost two hours 1 hour 45 minutes it is
absolute<00:01:49.259> hell<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.360> opinion<00:01:51.450> worse

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
absolute hell it is in my opinion worse

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.080 
absolute hell it is in my opinion worse
than<00:01:52.200> maths<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.399> bad<00:01:53.640> itself

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
than maths which is pretty bad itself

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.109 
than maths which is pretty bad itself
and<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:55.350> very<00:01:55.530> level<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.909> bit

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and it's very level which is the bit

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
and it's very level which is the bit
