alright guys now you got that single

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.000 
alright guys now you got that single
crack<00:00:12.880> down<00:00:13.150> we're<00:00:14.140> gonna<00:00:14.350> go<00:00:14.620> over<00:00:14.830> how<00:00:14.980> to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
crack down we're gonna go over how to

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.490 
crack down we're gonna go over how to
build<00:00:15.280> a<00:00:15.340> cadence<00:00:15.610> I<00:00:15.849> declare<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:17.050> need<00:00:17.200> five

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
build a cadence I declare you need five

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.950 
build a cadence I declare you need five
good<00:00:18.010> quacks<00:00:18.310> so<00:00:19.090> if<00:00:19.360> you're<00:00:19.539> still<00:00:19.780> working

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
good quacks so if you're still working

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.920 
good quacks so if you're still working
on<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.830> know<00:00:20.860> one<00:00:21.220> two<00:00:21.460> three<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.690> really

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
on you know one two three you really

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.200 
on you know one two three you really
need<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.110> build<00:00:23.260> up<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.500> five<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.000> they<00:00:25.060> just

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
need to build up to five and they just

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:35.700 
need to build up to five and they just
need<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.449> be<00:00:25.570> spaced<00:00:25.900> out<00:00:26.140> even<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:35.350> able<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.589> do

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
need to be spaced out even be able to do

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.270 
need to be spaced out even be able to do
that<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.390> if<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.929> got<00:00:38.079> that<00:00:38.260> down<00:00:38.469> but<00:00:39.039> I<00:00:39.100> want

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.930 

I<00:00:49.870> want<00:00:50.679> you<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:50.859> practice<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.309> little<00:00:51.459> cadence

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
I want you to practice a little cadence

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.639 
I want you to practice a little cadence
of<00:00:52.059> three<00:00:52.329> because<00:00:52.870> what<00:00:53.049> that's<00:00:53.170> gonna<00:00:53.409> turn

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
of three because what that's gonna turn

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.360 
of three because what that's gonna turn
into<00:00:53.799> is<00:00:54.579> your<00:00:54.850> five<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.799> way<00:00:56.979> we<00:00:57.159> build

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
into is your five now the way we build

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.779 
into is your five now the way we build
the<00:00:57.459> cadence<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:59.079> don't<00:00:59.289> go<00:00:59.649> harder<00:01:00.639> to

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
the cadence is they don't go harder to

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.530 
the cadence is they don't go harder to
softer<00:01:01.389> or<00:01:01.679> I<00:01:02.679> run<00:01:03.249> the<00:01:03.369> call<00:01:03.549> her<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:04.150> softer

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
softer or I run the call her to softer

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.730 
softer or I run the call her to softer
on<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.720> bottom<00:01:04.989> that's<00:01:05.199> not<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> way<00:01:05.620> they

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
on the bottom that's not the way they

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.150 
on the bottom that's not the way they
work<00:01:06.300> it's<00:01:07.300> just<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.810> stepping<00:01:08.380> down<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.980> the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
work it's just a stepping down of the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.760 
work it's just a stepping down of the
length<00:01:09.370> of<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> notes<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.910> run<00:01:13.120> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.640 

notes<00:01:17.770> are<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.130> shorter<00:01:18.490> as<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.760> go<00:01:18.910> down

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
notes are just shorter as you go down

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.900 
notes are just shorter as you go down
you<00:01:20.650> don't<00:01:20.770> want<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.070> go<00:01:23.220> yes<00:01:24.220> another<00:01:24.430> cadence

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
you don't want to go yes another cadence

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.890 
you don't want to go yes another cadence
that's<00:01:25.720> throwing<00:01:26.050> different<00:01:26.200> ducks<00:01:26.530> out<00:01:26.740> so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's throwing different ducks out so

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's throwing different ducks out so
same<00:01:28.900> pressure<00:01:29.680> same<00:01:30.490> volume<00:01:30.790> all<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.210> way

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
same pressure same volume all the way

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:51.360 
same pressure same volume all the way
down<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:49.659> you're<00:01:50.620> starting<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:50.980> build<00:01:51.130> your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
down now you're starting to build your

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.149 
down now you're starting to build your
cadence<00:01:51.580> up<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.020> basically<00:01:53.290> your<00:01:53.650> first<00:01:53.830> note

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
cadence up so basically your first note

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.190 
cadence up so basically your first note
just<00:01:54.880> needs<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.210> be<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> lot<00:01:55.540> longer<00:01:55.720> than<00:01:55.960> your

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
just needs to be a lot longer than your

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.910 
just needs to be a lot longer than your
last<00:01:56.350> note<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.600> be<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> first<00:01:59.560> in<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.130> last

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
last note and be the first in the last

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:19.830 
last note and be the first in the last
same<00:02:02.920> volume<00:02:03.190> same<00:02:03.580> pressure<00:02:03.850> though

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.900 

so<00:02:20.840> we're<00:02:21.470> gonna<00:02:21.560> try<00:02:21.830> something<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.760> I'm

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
so we're gonna try something and I'm

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.510 
so we're gonna try something and I'm
gonna<00:02:23.030> run<00:02:23.270> through<00:02:23.480> these<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.080> and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
gonna run through these with you and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.680 
gonna run through these with you and
probably<00:02:25.520> gonna<00:02:25.760> feel<00:02:26.000> silly<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:26.570> you're

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
probably gonna feel silly but if you're

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.910 
probably gonna feel silly but if you're
doing<00:02:26.840> better<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.320> what<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.470> do<00:02:27.560> somebody

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
doing better this is what I do somebody

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.650 
doing better this is what I do somebody
if<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.430> shop<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.850> dunno<00:02:29.300> they<00:02:29.600> do

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
if they have to shop I dunno they do

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:49.540 
if they have to shop I dunno they do
another<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:39.500> run<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:49.160> your<00:02:49.340> cadence

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
another just run that's your cadence

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.400 
another just run that's your cadence
fellas<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.630> said<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:50.990> just<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.230> lot

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
fellas like I said it's just a lot

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.980 
fellas like I said it's just a lot
longer<00:02:51.560> note<00:02:52.030> than<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.210> EndNote<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
longer note than the EndNote but the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.430 
longer note than the EndNote but the
pressure<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> volume<00:02:54.740> stays<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.400> same
