00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.599
 hello how about youtube friends good at 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 this time is a new video tutorial 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 to show you how to update our 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.440
 bathroom is without the need to update 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 through itunes or anything good this is 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.060
 more than anything to fool the system of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 our ios 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
 that is, for a new version to appear 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.349
 recent will simply be false but 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.329
 will appear a newer version is a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.120
 very good trick that I discovered for 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.980
 it is investigating by google and good 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 we occupied having 28 well in this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 device and have Syria installed and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.050
 they simply install in the application 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.239
 ipad wi-fi whatever you want to call the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 they install already when long they have installed 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.110
 they just open it 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 sorry I'm going to show you have to go 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.910
 at the beginning of everything 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.720
 that would be nothing more than a slash bar 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.690
 well here they go where it says system 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.610
 is here and then they will rid and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.130
 good and the book let's go to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 with service core services as 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 as they understand it better and here they will go 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.189
 to the bottom where it exists in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 version to give tap and here they give cover in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.460
 text viewer and text invite 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 we can see that our are going to see and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.009
 edit we can see that our year is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.310
 good me ios 4.3.2 good here we're going to 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310
 check 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.780
 let me 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 we will check 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.050
 we are going to generate information 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 and well here we can see that indeed 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 me is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 4.3.2 here is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.420
 and good with this we will be able to install 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.690
 ios 5 applications for example 6 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.300
 if you decide to stop that year is that year 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.480
 it's ok well here we're going to try a 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.480
 application 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.239
 so they can see how I could not install it 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.080
 here we wait for me to load up and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.580
 simply without this trick we are going to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.580
 can install the applications 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.540
 well here we wait for you to take care 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.960
 I do not know why it was so good but 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.310
 here in charge is a translator 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.330
 see I'm going to give it install and it tells me that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.090
 it requires ios 5 ok 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.240
 well let's perform the trick of a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.240
 time 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.310
 here where telling our ios 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.480
 we are simply going to change it, we erase 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.510
 that 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.489
 and we put the year is that we want to have 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:30.560
 for example 5.1.1 ok now we are going in 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.890
 save and ready we give cover in ok and eye 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.140
 do not go to install the application right now 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.290
 just restart and after that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.900
 restart and adjustments are made so that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.090
 see and good friends here is over 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.579
 to restart already learned and not already 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.450
 I learned my good device again 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.450
 let's go to settings 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.480
 general information 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.500
 and we can see that we already have the version 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.740
 5.1 point 1 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.420
 well let's see if we can install 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.390
 the application 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.090
 that as you can see a while ago he did not let me 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.270
 install it let's see if I already uninstall 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.270
 the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.470
 here we wait for a moment to load 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.730
 I have no idea why it takes 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.630
 so much in loading but good simply 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.630
 let's hope 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.320
 at some point no longer of maybe 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.419
 God takes a long time to load good 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.419
 we wait 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.610
 and well have finished loading see 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.520
 the same application 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.520
 well let's install 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.019
 and see and let me install it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.199
 I just put my password 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.680
 and well here I let myself install it already 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.169
 was unloading and that has been all 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.300
