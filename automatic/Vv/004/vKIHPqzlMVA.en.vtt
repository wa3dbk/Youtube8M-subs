00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
turns it turns okay I mean it's pretty

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.780 
turns it turns okay I mean it's pretty
sluggish<00:01:15.490> but<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:18.140> kind<00:01:18.620> of<00:01:18.860> its<00:01:19.490> kind<00:01:19.640> of

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
sluggish but it's kind of its kind of

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.770 
sluggish but it's kind of its kind of
got<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:19.940> crispy<00:01:20.510> feel<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:22.420> yeah<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.660> pretty

got a crispy feel and yeah it's pretty
sluggish<00:01:24.230> so<00:01:24.680> as<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.940> probably<00:01:26.330> expect<00:01:26.690> but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
sluggish so as you probably expect but

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.500 
sluggish so as you probably expect but
this<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.630> super-tight<00:01:30.230> version<00:01:33.970> yeah<00:01:34.970> I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
this is a super-tight version yeah I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.870 
this is a super-tight version yeah I
just<00:01:36.290> leave<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.740> for<00:01:36.800> jiggler<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.700> got

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
just leave this for jiggler and it got

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.820 
just leave this for jiggler and it got
way<00:01:38.120> better<00:01:38.360> used<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.900> be<00:01:39.020> as<00:01:39.140> bad<00:01:39.380> as<00:01:39.440> my

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
way better used to be as bad as my

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.550 
way better used to be as bad as my
original<00:01:40.520> Rubik's<00:01:41.120> used<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.660> be<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.990> here<00:01:42.350> is

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
original Rubik's used to be in here is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.790 
original Rubik's used to be in here is
my<00:01:42.830> original<00:01:43.100> original<00:01:43.730> remix<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.620> old

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
my original original remix with the old

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.840 
my original original remix with the old
design<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:47.290> have<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.440> say<00:01:48.650> this<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.340> better<00:01:49.610> than

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
design I have to say this is better than

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.340 
design I have to say this is better than
this<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.560> think<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:52.760> my<00:01:52.940> opinion<00:01:53.360> because<00:01:53.900> mine

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
this I think in my opinion because mine

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.420 
this I think in my opinion because mine
is<00:01:54.560> modern<00:01:55.070> saloon<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.740> both<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.100> them<00:01:58.280> a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
is modern saloon but both of them a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.200 
is modern saloon but both of them a
little<00:01:58.580> bit<00:01:58.790> jiggly<00:01:59.000> but<00:01:59.570> this<00:02:00.410> one<00:02:00.650> is<00:02:00.800> just

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
little bit jiggly but this one is just

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
little bit jiggly but this one is just
better<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.750> my<00:02:02.930> opinion

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
better in my opinion

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.490 
better in my opinion
turns<00:02:05.710> better<00:02:08.490> but<00:02:09.490> yeah<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.260> one

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
turns better but yeah but this one

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.930 
turns better but yeah but this one
corner<00:02:11.950> cuts<00:02:12.190> better<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:15.220> actually<00:02:15.400> corner

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
corner cuts better it actually corner

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.990 
corner cuts better it actually corner
cuts<00:02:16.770> about<00:02:17.790> line<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.150> line<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:20.550> reverse<00:02:21.550> is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
cuts about line to line and reverse is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.880 
cuts about line to line and reverse is
like<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.480> third<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.080> piece<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.770> actually

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
like a third of a piece so it's actually

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like a third of a piece so it's actually
not<00:02:24.160> too<00:02:24.340> bad<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.000> department<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.700> does

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
not too bad in that department it does

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.360 
not too bad in that department it does
use<00:02:28.120> tiles<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> service<00:02:29.410> regular<00:02:29.890> stickers

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
use tiles and service regular stickers

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.130 
use tiles and service regular stickers

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and they do look pretty nice and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.229 
and they do look pretty nice and
obviously<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.860> it'll<00:02:33.250> stay<00:02:33.520> new<00:02:33.790> forever

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.520 
bumping the tripod sorry but yeah that's
pretty<00:02:45.010> much<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.400> say<00:02:45.519> about<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.530> it's

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
pretty much I have to say about it it's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.580 
pretty much I have to say about it it's
in<00:02:47.890> okay<00:02:48.310> tube<00:02:48.780> obviously<00:02:49.780> has<00:02:49.959> some<00:02:50.170> lock-up

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
in okay tube obviously has some lock-up

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.940 
in okay tube obviously has some lock-up
issues<00:02:50.980> yeah<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.150> doesn't<00:02:52.420> pop<00:02:52.950> within

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
issues yeah but it doesn't pop within

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.640 
issues yeah but it doesn't pop within
the<00:02:54.180> super<00:02:55.180> tight<00:02:55.360> function<00:02:55.780> any<00:02:56.019> anti-pot

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the super tight function any anti-pot

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.340 
the super tight function any anti-pot
mechanism<00:02:57.360> which<00:02:58.360> i<00:02:58.540> won't<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.900> showing<00:02:59.140> you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
mechanism which i won't be showing you

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.120 
mechanism which i won't be showing you
because<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.280> way<00:03:00.489> too<00:03:00.550> tight<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.269> but<00:03:02.130> I'm

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
because it's way too tight to but I'm

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.650 
because it's way too tight to but I'm
going<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> attempt<00:03:05.519> speed<00:03:06.519> solve<00:03:06.850> hopefully

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
going to attempt speed solve hopefully

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.210 
going to attempt speed solve hopefully
this<00:03:07.840> isn't<00:03:08.019> afraid<00:03:08.350> because<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:08.950> not

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
this isn't afraid because I'm not

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.160 
this isn't afraid because I'm not
looking<00:03:09.700> through<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.329> viewfinder<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:11.079> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
looking through the viewfinder for the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.740 
looking through the viewfinder for the
selection<00:03:11.970> looking<00:03:12.970> under<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.690> course

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
selection looking under it but of course

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.150 
selection looking under it but of course
my<00:03:14.200> little<00:03:14.560> head<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:15.040> still<00:03:16.530> gone<00:03:17.530> down<00:03:17.890> the

my little head is still gone down the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.039 
my little head is still gone down the
drain<00:03:18.370> even<00:03:18.970> though<00:03:19.150> I'm<00:03:19.209> looking<00:03:19.360> under<00:03:19.720> the

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
drain even though I'm looking under the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:28.650 
drain even though I'm looking under the
massager<00:03:20.470> but<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:26.220> learned<00:03:27.220> my<00:03:27.430> jeepers<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
massager but I learned my jeepers I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.750 
massager but I learned my jeepers I
don't<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:28.959> why<00:03:29.230> I'm<00:03:29.440> fascinated<00:03:29.860> about<00:03:30.400> it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
don't know why I'm fascinated about it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240 
don't know why I'm fascinated about it
some<00:03:31.600> reason<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.110> just<00:03:32.140> have<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> thing<00:03:32.860> against

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
some reason I just have a thing against

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.280 
some reason I just have a thing against
learning<00:03:33.700> my<00:03:33.820> jeepers<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:35.019> there

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
learning my jeepers I know there

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.289 
learning my jeepers I know there
shouldn't<00:03:35.620> be<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.950> hard<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.610> learn<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.030> I

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
shouldn't be that hard to learn but I

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.270 
shouldn't be that hard to learn but I
don't<00:03:37.720> even<00:03:37.810> know<00:03:38.079> what<00:03:38.260> what<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:38.829> what's
