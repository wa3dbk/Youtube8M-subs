00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.890
 Federal savings bank 2010 contest to streamline this text the issue 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.899
 three 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.739
 this is the proof you can meet with the cespe site 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.380
 nice contest with a tourniquet above 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.630
 What are you up to today? 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.779
 the question then presents 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.689
 a store where he made 10,000 reais 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.979
 with interest payments of 5% 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.319
 per month 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.110
 and death theme syrups 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.910
 of constant mutation, the question is what the sum 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.670
 of benefits paid 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's get into financial problem math 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 it's an issue then 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.080
 the adesa that of jouissance and debt 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.710
 kalou any benefit is what you have today after the action 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.830
 is given by 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.679
 interest but the motivation 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.659
 then with this action time has the just and the one who has the most emotion of power 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.659
 in the case of savio constant change both by pt 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.120
 divided by 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.610
 the amount of the periods to be paid 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 to this debt 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.230
 interest is always 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 the interest rate of on cheer at that moment 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 about lucas to use that was obtained given that it is the vp - the quality times 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 in another action was paid 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 and we also have that the sum but action 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.400
 it is the skin that is evident 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
 principal interest rate quoted nothing immediately 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.130
 the loot and with some luck 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.960
 the important aspect 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 in the afternoon if we consume assaltiva the pieces are declining 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 and interest 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 decline over time with the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.840
 let us turn to the question 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.410
 of the test 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.490
 exhaustion 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 initially we will calculate 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.180
 the cemtec debt 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.360
 after the installment ten thousand per quota 2 500 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.960
 in the sequence then we have in each month the debtor 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.870
 and for each time they calculate the then 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.510
 after hard 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.740
 the correspondence in the first month 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.960
 only debtors at 10 thousand reais 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.090
 and the judge then option had imposed interest rates 500 retort vision 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.479
 second month the solid reduced dead stock of the 7,500 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.979
 the deputy concentrates on 7 5 reais so we have here every month the calculation 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.960
 of interest and the sum total then we gave ten thousand shares which is the steam 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.299
 the summation 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.299
 was the interest for which also the 12 50 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.839
 the answer then in question letter b 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.919
 the 1150 picked up 10,000 of the mutation that the baby 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.819
 at 12.50 per share 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.539
 interest paid 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.449
 as we have seen then neither make a point of stressing what you get 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.469
 he knows what's here price is a requirement 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.729
 but why in part with the box that the usda 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.549
 I think that if you go in you the semasa that for your furniture releases 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.979
 No way to know this after the box contest 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.979
 and taking advantage to learn more and take consequences 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.349
 in this question still only problem in the contest 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.310
 Allen said that if they cover prices someday he prefers the facts why it is 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.689
 pays less interest 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.269
 and will have pieces of stalls 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.579
 but was to lend price peseiro 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.549
 everyone will have more games gave long time shot 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.529
 is to bring more starter as it happens to my cereal on serve price in that 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.209
