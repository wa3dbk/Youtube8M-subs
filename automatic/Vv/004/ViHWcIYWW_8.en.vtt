to emphasize it even more so when I kind
of<00:01:18.729> go<00:01:18.909> blushed<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.720> flushed<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.560> this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
of go blushed and flushed I go to this

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.289 
of go blushed and flushed I go to this
color<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.369> would<00:01:21.670> choose<00:01:21.880> something<00:01:22.270> a

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
color so I would choose something a

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.640 
color so I would choose something a
little<00:01:22.450> bit<00:01:22.540> lighter<00:01:22.689> maybe<00:01:23.020> like<00:01:23.260> this<00:01:23.439> one

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
little bit lighter maybe like this one

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.130 
little bit lighter maybe like this one
right<00:01:23.830> here<00:01:23.890> or<00:01:24.310> maybe<00:01:24.790> even<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.210> coral<00:01:25.720> or<00:01:25.900> just

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
right here or maybe even a coral or just

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.200 
right here or maybe even a coral or just
a<00:01:26.290> bronzer<00:01:26.920> something<00:01:27.549> that's<00:01:27.729> slightly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
a bronzer something that's slightly

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.609 
a bronzer something that's slightly
different<00:01:28.600> something<00:01:29.080> that's<00:01:29.380> kind<00:01:29.560> of

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
different something that's kind of

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.469 
different something that's kind of
almost<00:01:29.799> like<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.159> opposite<00:01:30.670> color<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.330> you're

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
almost like the opposite color so you're

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.120 
almost like the opposite color so you're
not<00:01:31.630> going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.960> emphasize<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.650> even<00:01:32.950> more

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
not going to emphasize it even more

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.590 
not going to emphasize it even more
you're<00:01:33.580> just<00:01:33.640> going<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:33.970> give<00:01:34.150> yourself<00:01:34.270> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
you're just going to give yourself a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600 
you're just going to give yourself a
little<00:01:34.780> bit<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.140> subtle<00:01:35.590> life<00:01:35.830> for<00:01:36.159> when<00:01:36.400> your

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
little bit of subtle life for when your

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.490 
little bit of subtle life for when your
skin<00:01:36.939> isn't<00:01:37.210> blushing<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.140> when<00:01:38.259> you're<00:01:38.380> not

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
skin isn't blushing and when you're not

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.990 
skin isn't blushing and when you're not
feeling<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> bit<00:01:39.100> embarrassed<00:01:39.549> or<00:01:39.729> when<00:01:39.880> your

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
feeling a bit embarrassed or when your

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.179 
feeling a bit embarrassed or when your
rosacea<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.689> covered<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.799> if<00:01:42.040> it

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
rosacea is covered and then if it

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.280 
rosacea is covered and then if it
happens<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.700> come<00:01:42.880> through<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.540> not<00:01:44.020> going

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
happens to come through it's not going

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.020 
happens to come through it's not going
to<00:01:44.409> be<00:01:44.530> emphasized<00:01:45.100> even<00:01:45.250> more<00:01:45.640> because<00:01:45.909> you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
to be emphasized even more because you

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.700 
to be emphasized even more because you
haven't<00:01:46.329> put<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.540> same<00:01:46.750> color<00:01:47.049> on<00:01:47.140> top<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.560> it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
haven't put the same color on top of it

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.560 
haven't put the same color on top of it
my<00:01:48.100> favorite<00:01:48.610> way<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.790> picking<00:01:49.060> out<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.420> right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
my favorite way of picking out the right

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.749 
my favorite way of picking out the right
blush<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.229> match<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.650> with<00:01:50.829> my<00:01:50.860> lipstick<00:01:51.520> so

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
blush is to match it with my lipstick so

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.090 
blush is to match it with my lipstick so
whatever<00:01:52.030> lip<00:01:52.270> color<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.689> lip<00:01:53.020> gloss<00:01:53.229> or<00:01:53.530> even

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
whatever lip color a lip gloss or even

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.920 
whatever lip color a lip gloss or even
I'm<00:01:54.189> just<00:01:54.369> going<00:01:54.579> for<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.759> sheer<00:01:55.060> lip<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.540> will

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
I'm just going for a sheer lip I will

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.569 
I'm just going for a sheer lip I will
match<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.170> with<00:01:56.619> my<00:01:56.799> cheeks<00:01:57.100> because<00:01:57.250> they

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
match that with my cheeks because they

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.039 
match that with my cheeks because they
always<00:01:57.970> work<00:01:58.119> really<00:01:58.390> really<00:01:58.720> well<00:01:58.869> together

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
always work really really well together

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.410 
always work really really well together
so<00:01:59.770> if<00:01:59.979> I'm<00:02:00.130> wearing<00:02:00.340> like<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.640> coral<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.240> lip

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
so if I'm wearing like a coral a lip

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
so if I'm wearing like a coral a lip
color<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.899> would<00:02:01.960> wear<00:02:02.229> carl's<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:02.860> my<00:02:02.979> cheeks

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
color I would wear carl's on my cheeks

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.520 
color I would wear carl's on my cheeks
like<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.670> did<00:02:03.850> today<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:04.600> I'm<00:02:04.899> wearing<00:02:05.079> pink<00:02:05.380> I

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I was seriously just trying to stay away

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.170 
I was seriously just trying to stay away
from<00:02:34.709> anything<00:02:35.220> too<00:02:35.519> much<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> cheeks

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
from anything too much on the cheeks

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.910 
from anything too much on the cheeks
when<00:02:36.420> you're<00:02:36.569> wearing<00:02:36.720> such<00:02:37.140> an<00:02:37.319> intense<00:02:37.650> lip

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so for those cases just stick to the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.330 
so for those cases just stick to the
bronzer<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> easiest<00:02:41.100> way<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
bronzer because it's the easiest way to
