00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 Hello UTB stuffing today I will 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.599
 make a car with articulated highways 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.040
 no i don't swear it's just that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.230
 google name sometime later 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.750
 that is first we need to take two 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 block for the base is in my case 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.330
 it will be such things like 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.150
 trolleys you can take them babu 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:32.300
 themselves but the main thing is that they be complete 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.370
 inside of such a person like that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 we take two of these things with them just 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.489
 will the house be made without them so 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 we put on one of them just such a piece of iron 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 somehow need to choose so that she 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.829
 was as smooth as possible and all that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.400
 principle can be a little bit different 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:12.560
 do the truth they will not be very good 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 move but they will work 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 that's how it should be here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 this side so here is essentially nothing 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.189
 that 's only left to do at 10 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.180
 put there or in front is the same 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 put but it is purely mine here because 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.439
 the fact that my trolleys are not quite 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.840
 even 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:41.310
 it turned out also the offset passed in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 side for that we just but on 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.500
 some 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 how many centimeters or meters are there and and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.790
 just move aside the time when 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 it is trapped by two of the same risks and 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.570
 Now they will be exactly and you can 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.899
 also move they do nothing they 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.400
 just make a smoother surface 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:10.940
 so here now we take welding 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.060
 and I didn't need to do it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.630
 just to be convenient, just output 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.580
 these are the two main carts 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.310
 everything can be removed now you can 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.980
 twist here so here i don't remember whether did 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.920
 I take it before this cart in 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.290
 team aquis centers and attach to this one 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.170
 all of us now she will have 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.560
 spinning so i still wanted to do it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 world for this highway 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:55.820
 take and all stop air take 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.990
 throw see these blocks to us 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.490
 need four pieces 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:06.100
 if the highway is 8 wheels and take the same 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.430
 very team father and put them 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:15.100
 somewhere well that's how i'm about to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.100
 were not in the middle and as much as possible below 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:25.310
 but have each of them do the same 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.730
 but the thing that they were just exactly here 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.730
 so here 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.630
 And the house on the grid is called a smart snap 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.980
 if anyone knows but this is for 13 harris 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.600
 fashion in my opinion which is not at all 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:46.800
 nothing so we all did now 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.880
 take them well 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.520
 Well, we freeze and put on them 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.320
 some block like this 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.320
 but that he also was in the middle and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.150
 it is necessary to put it a little higher because 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.770
 well, so that it was softer a little bit 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:15.050
 suspension he will do the same thing cleanly 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.050
 with all so 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.950
 here 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:29.840
 and here is the same then you will see 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:35.660
 why did it have to be done so now 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.480
 we have them welding the main structure immediately 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.680
 we increase their weight is not much but 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.300
 increasing let's say 20 will be enough 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.870
 for both so addon canopy there 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.720
 symbol 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.510
 shop if you need it so yourself 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.790
 because I have 13 in 10 garry's mod 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.480
 so now we only need to put on 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.250
 them just 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:08.000
 and the steering wheel do what for 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:13.790
 this we raise a little higher so 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.010
 first i want to put wheels for 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.940
 this is what we align with me a little bit 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.510
 will be different 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.220
 other than the need to be well, what can be 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.650
 make up for that i just 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.890
 take advantage of the science team barks turn on 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:34.730
 collision so the value itself is 82 and set by 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:38.930
 two wheels on one spring or what 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.440
 this is a balancer knife and put on two 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.040
 wheels 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.360
 so that four wheels per cart 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.840
 so in this way we turn them over 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.100
 one side and take the science team barks 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.530
 click on the wheel and then on the cart 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.210
 this way now I will not be calm 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:06.500
 go through this cart and not 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:11.240
 interfere and so need in my opinion yet 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:14.590
 a little weight will increase alek a little 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.590
 raise it to 50 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.370
 so that both have to increase 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.390
 but you can be somehow different 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.040
 do but 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:30.120
 well the chassis is not 50 to which other 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.440
 values all this thing started to go 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.200
 now we only need to do one 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.110
 thing leave the steering wheel and how in 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.060
 all my videos actual it will be 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:46.710
 that's it that's it that's the wheel 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:51.640
 you put braking and we will leave to 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.980
 rotating carts so essentially all 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.860
 ready well you can do everything yourself 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:01.900
 complement at its own discretion here I am here 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:08.280
 i'm doing just that my 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:11.470
 representation that is penned chassis with 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.290
 With this suspension, let's take it a little bit. 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:20.670
 check for those who are interested in the map 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:24.460
 called see i m corr construct 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:26.440
 here and so she overcomes us 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.140
 obstacles as you can see the suspension a little bit 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.000
 leans in the right direction . now 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:37.870
 let's see how it looks like you 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.870
 we see it first overwhelmed by one side 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.130
 well if one side rises then 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.970
 second country 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:48.250
 Well, how would it go down dependent 

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.170
 suspension is called well thank you all 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.100
 like to view likes subscribe 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.100
 and all bye
