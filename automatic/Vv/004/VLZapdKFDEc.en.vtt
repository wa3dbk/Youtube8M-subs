00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
see if there's any place where it's

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.969 
see if there's any place where it's
dripping<00:05:47.250> through<00:05:47.840> see<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.020> uh<00:05:49.200> rather

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
dripping through see it's uh rather

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.850 
dripping through see it's uh rather
windy<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:51.169> this<00:05:52.169> was<00:05:52.350> tighter<00:05:52.650> it

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
windy and it's this was tighter it

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.320 
windy and it's this was tighter it
wouldn't<00:05:53.130> move<00:05:53.250> around<00:05:53.490> as<00:05:53.729> much<00:05:53.910> but<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.180> is

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
wouldn't move around as much but it is

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.520 
wouldn't move around as much but it is
moving<00:05:54.840> around<00:05:55.050> quite<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.410> bit<00:05:56.810> but<00:06:00.320> don't<00:06:01.320> know

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
moving around quite a bit but don't know

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.480 
moving around quite a bit but don't know
if<00:06:01.710> that's<00:06:01.979> well<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:02.970> think<00:06:03.750> that's<00:06:03.930> really

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
if that's well I think that's really

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.580 
if that's well I think that's really
gripping<00:06:05.490> through<00:06:05.820> its<00:06:06.510> damp<00:06:06.840> underneath<00:06:07.380> you

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
gripping through its damp underneath you

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.840 
gripping through its damp underneath you

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
and it didn't get wet

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.370 
and it didn't get wet
there's<00:07:05.760> a<00:07:05.790> couple<00:07:05.970> spots<00:07:06.180> that<00:07:06.840> felt<00:07:07.230> a

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
there's a couple spots that felt a

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.130 
there's a couple spots that felt a
little<00:07:07.500> damp<00:07:07.920> but<00:07:08.250> my<00:07:08.400> bag<00:07:08.640> wasn't<00:07:09.060> wet<00:07:09.270> like

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
little damp but my bag wasn't wet like

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.920 
little damp but my bag wasn't wet like
inside<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:11.280> that's<00:07:11.730> it<00:07:12.120> was<00:07:12.270> out<00:07:12.450> there<00:07:12.690> for

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
inside and that's it was out there for

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.770 
inside and that's it was out there for
like<00:07:13.050> eight<00:07:13.290> hours<00:07:13.500> in<00:07:13.980> total<00:07:14.640> you<00:07:15.270> know<00:07:15.330> rain

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
like eight hours in total you know rain

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.980 
like eight hours in total you know rain
storm<00:07:16.490> so<00:07:17.490> I<00:07:17.760> think<00:07:18.090> this<00:07:18.390> year<00:07:18.600> would<00:07:18.720> work

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
storm so I think this year would work

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.310 
storm so I think this year would work
and<00:07:19.560> like<00:07:20.280> it<00:07:20.430> is<00:07:20.730> you<00:07:21.390> guys<00:07:21.630> know<00:07:21.930> if<00:07:22.110> you<00:07:22.170> see

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.320 
and like it is you guys know if you see
my<00:07:22.470> other<00:07:22.500> video<00:07:22.890> then<00:07:23.640> I<00:07:23.730> have<00:07:23.850> two<00:07:24.060> of<00:07:24.090> these

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330
