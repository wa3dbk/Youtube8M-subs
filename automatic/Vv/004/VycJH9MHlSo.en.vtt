00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.060
 it is possible to make a project that are respectful and at the same time the action 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.169
 viable economic 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.539
 when one is an entrepreneur when one has this ability 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.730
 I find that is 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.650
 quite right to put it to the service so 2 two of projects 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 respectful 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.989
 I know how to manage and no problem you want to make money I'm still 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.289
 I'm not wasting his time 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189
 by cons what I understood what you do not want to give you money 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.380
 for the bank 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.840
 here and so that costs 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.440
 e 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 layton started to move in my head 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.550
 and for some time after I met stone 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.150
 stone rabhi 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.170
 gh 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.730
 it's starting to make sense 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.200
 I want my story is also 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.650
 the story 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.550
 from there but finally 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.900
 who is born of a mother 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.780
 peasant and a father 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.090
 trade treaties 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.490
 when I met stone 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.570
 10 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.480
 what appeared to me 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.030
 is that this peasant side 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 I could relay it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 at his side entrepreneurs 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.620
 by setting up a project 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.630
 I will undertake 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 a respectable 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.410
 Elisabeth the team the company 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.360
 at that time so 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 your friends 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.980
 Clearly 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.130
 it is of course in this project it was not enough 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.340
 bertrand in e to highlight the apartheid father land 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.020
 it was also necessary to work 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.650
 about human relationship and about human respect through 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.860
 basically children 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 we actually build in us 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.729
 e will say the sector 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 left 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 of cooperation 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.900
 q who we 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.220
 you know who is not acquired who follows us 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.410
 so we do not have who is aligned 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.149
 m out of competition in front there is no problem that's what makes it cooked 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.090
 operation needed 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.079
 so allow to break 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.269
 p starting for example 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.749
 and so this is where the project of the halls 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.749
 we are here today with all that the breakthrough 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.189
 that's the whole project so a farm 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.699
 or as workers 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.499
 therefore in polyculture-breeding that is to say all life cycles 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.569
 are respectful 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.669
 we know 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.259
 gardening 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.099
 arboriculture 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.239
 we dug up an offer about twenty hectares 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.509
 where he grows cereals 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.140
 and alternating with herbs so it's done 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.849
 main point of view of the village 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.069
 we are going to feed a talk 35 'mobility goats quillan get us the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.860
 milk this milk has turned into cheese on the way we will produce 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.859
 whey rather than swinging in nature we will feed the pigs 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 and we have to feed ourselves 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.759
 vegetables 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.340
 fruits as harvested 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.300
 cheeses made by whey for its part pardons and therefore that 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.659
 meat procured by the pigs by the beasts talk 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.370
 the lambs will fail km and of course by the cereals 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.349
 which are turned into flour 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.209
 that's the food part so he will accompany the whole project and 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.779
 all the people who come here 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.420
 see this stay here 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 how to feed exclusively on what is produced on the spot 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.590
 so that m to the domain 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.639
 we warm up 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.760
 basically the sun a bit with the wood also m 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.329
 the solar panels 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.790
 we have a wind turbine that transforms so 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.780
 the wind in electricity ap 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.730
 which allows us to we are quite connected to the network but it is necessary 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.680
 close so 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.570
 of tame prized finally that is to say that when we have too much energy in the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.810
 network as not surprising the network we consume pretty much what we 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.249
 product 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.509
 and 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.589
 so we did lindemann took a special passion for the om 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.580
 so we have a water network 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.409
 % from two sources 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.280
 which allow us 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.569
 so in another kind of years that allows us 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.000
 so can a patent party our animals to water it 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.739
 % and the people who are here have also stolen 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.029
 from the community 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.949
 and that this bone for the collected and exciting system of 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.120
 phyto-purification 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.380
 and so we will have turkey 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.780
 all these beasts also get you the composites obviously and my iphone 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.099
 for the earth 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.369
 we also worked the kids to protour so recovery 

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.100
 feces 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.009
 the same 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.579
 and so it is that fasting he's urinating 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.159
 to separate 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.029
 and recover transformed feces to vermicomposting 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.800
 so with 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.460
 the last options 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.139
 halak who will turn his shot on goal 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.479
 all the buildings colas built you have one and we built them with the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.419
 mummy land with the device but in mannheim complaint with the wood that we have 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.090
 bought next with the stone puel 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.559
 so that all the buildings auto and eco-constructions 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.839
 situation so much room for these kruger products I cited 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.069
 there are very very few six innings to a hot shot of course 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.910
 what would create so it is important that all this 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.849
 animates our days 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.279
 and we will share it with people who come if a stay 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.270
 families 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.789
 whether it's individuals or groups 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.270
 and that this is big shots of the group of children under the 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.220
 classes discovered green classes 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.220
 therefore since the state is grateful for the national education 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:34.530
 I pass 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.530
 gold my money obviously so know it by my damascus work 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.650
 since that's what I have more accumulate before 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.120
 and also by the strong swell entrepreneurial character 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.120
 it's hard because we believe in it 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.689
 as always the same day today 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.349
 more than 1000 people who are 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.300
 the wall they are agreed today 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.249
 and who is testifying to me 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.479
 thank you 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.990
 I'm against myself 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.290
 his counterpart all the time all the money I put into this project 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.199
 all the time I spent
