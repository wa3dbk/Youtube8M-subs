00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello girls today I brought you this 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.420
 option of super super lips 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.099
 flashy with beatle and good I hope that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.460
 this local idea might like to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.460
 your 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 good girls I clarify this makeup 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.369
 you can use it for a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 party night simply the lips 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 so very bright and cough and with a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.580
 makeup not so charged in the eyes it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 is going to look spectacular so we're going to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 start first by passing an eyeliner 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.060
 this red circle and we are going to outline 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.060
 our lips 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 after delineating all our 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.400
 lips let's move on to place color and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 I am applying this of the long mark 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.560
 lasting is a matte gloss gloss and is a 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.560
 very intense red color 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.789
 to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.840
 now I will go to correct the areas of the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.630
 laterals always tends to happen that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.480
 we apply a labial angles and we are 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.420
 it happens a little bit so that's what it's used for 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.100
 the concealer and also to do that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.840
 our lips look very 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.840
 protruding and thick 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.749
 now girls I'm going to apply again 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.909
 a layer of gloss to improve the 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:44.240
 intensity of the color and also so that 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.399
 those areas that are super humid 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.520
 and then I would take this glitter that is 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.040
 red color also intense and I'll put it 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.960
 with this brochita allow for all my 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.960
 lips remember that I'm using 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.920
 a matte block and then in this part is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.259
 still wet does not dry completely and this 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.280
 it helps us when it's gone to 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.130
 dry off 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.900
 everything is going to dry also with lilita and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.690
 It will not help us because after 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.760
 in our party or in this meeting 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.760
 night we will not fall even a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.500
 glitter residue so it's very 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.890
 important to do it with this kind of 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 lip 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.870
 ah 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.130
 and that is how our lips are 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.990
 very bright illuminated reds highlight 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.990
 very much so you will love them 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.670
 This time I made 2 colors 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.159
 of lips one in red and another in rosita 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.989
 if you loved this idea 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.719
 you can do it with the color that you 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.430
 they like it and good to use a lot the 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.049
 imagination that you are really going to see 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.450
 very nice 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.540
 now let's take a delineator of the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.280
 Mark knicks is a pink and we're going to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 delineate our lengths again 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.239
 we will take again this Martin 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.180
 of the brand also long lasting is a 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.040
 rosita barbies and then very carefully 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.579
 let's go through all of our 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.579
 lips 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.190
 we do the same thing again a year ago 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.570
 while correcting with this corrector 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.730
 around the mouth so that 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.050
 our lips look super super 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.050
 beautiful and perfect 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.420
 and finally take this glitter of the 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.870
 vice mark is a rossi is very very 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.450
 cute and combines perfect with this gloss 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.670
 so we're going to put it back with 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.030
 very careful 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.030
 ah 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.980
