progression and I just played some

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.610

we're<00:00:50.090> just<00:00:50.210> applying<00:00:50.480> those<00:00:50.840> patterns<00:00:51.579> let's

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
we're just applying those patterns let's

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.970

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.530 
string and pinched for and pinch so
finger<00:02:41.560> notes<00:02:41.769> can<00:02:42.069> only<00:02:42.340> come<00:02:42.730> with<00:02:43.209> bass

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
finger notes can only come with bass

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.410 
finger notes can only come with bass
notes<00:02:43.840> or<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.920> between<00:02:45.129> bass<00:02:45.760> notes<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.299> they

notes or in between bass notes and they
never<00:02:46.599> come<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.099> never<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.430> more<00:02:48.730> than

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
never come and you never have more than

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.960 
never come and you never have more than
one<00:02:49.230> finger<00:02:50.230> note<00:02:50.409> in<00:02:50.680> between<00:02:50.739> bass<00:02:51.400> notes<00:02:51.730> in

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
one finger note in between bass notes in

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.530 
one finger note in between bass notes in
this<00:02:52.150> style<00:02:53.190> okay<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.819> really<00:02:55.030> quite

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
this style okay so it's really quite

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.809 
this style okay so it's really quite
simple<00:02:55.569> you've<00:02:56.319> either<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.400> between

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
simple you've either put one in between

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.510 
simple you've either put one in between
the<00:02:58.060> base<00:02:58.209> notes

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.260 

or<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.390> pinch<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> bass<00:03:04.200> note

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.050 

and<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.990> course<00:03:08.490> what<00:03:09.490> makes<00:03:09.670> these<00:03:09.790> pieces

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and of course what makes these pieces

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.550 
and of course what makes these pieces
are<00:03:10.300> interesting<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.990> they<00:03:11.110> almost<00:03:11.290> always

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
are interesting is they almost always

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.820 
are interesting is they almost always
have<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.830> combination<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.610> those<00:03:12.760> two<00:03:12.820> things

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
have a combination of those two things

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.500 
have a combination of those two things
so<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.010> way<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.160> get<00:03:15.400> started<00:03:15.730> with<00:03:16.210> that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
so the way to get started with that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.050 
so the way to get started with that
technique<00:03:16.990> is<00:03:17.400> first<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.520> all<00:03:18.550> get<00:03:18.730> familiar

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
technique is first of all get familiar

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.330 
technique is first of all get familiar
with<00:03:19.150> putting<00:03:19.480> notes<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.960> between<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:21.160> base

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
with putting notes in between the base

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.980 
with putting notes in between the base
notes<00:03:21.580> let's<00:03:21.940> use<00:03:22.120> think<00:03:22.390> let's<00:03:22.540> use<00:03:22.720> strings

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
notes let's use think let's use strings

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.650 
notes let's use think let's use strings
one<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.470> two

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.979 

I'm<00:03:27.170> simply<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.680> 6<00:03:28.250> 14<00:03:29.180> 26<00:03:29.840> 1<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:30.830> 2

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
I'm simply going 6 14 26 1 for 2

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.600 
I'm simply going 6 14 26 1 for 2
then<00:03:32.989> try<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.319> do<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.500> by<00:03:33.620> using<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.980> third

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
then try and do it by using the third

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:44.820 
then try and do it by using the third
string<00:03:34.910> as<00:03:35.060> well<00:03:35.230> 6<00:03:36.230> 14<00:03:37.190> 26<00:03:38.080> 34<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:40.420> again<00:03:42.430> 614

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
string as well 6 14 26 34 to again 614

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.000 
string as well 6 14 26 34 to again 614
2634<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:47.380> when<00:03:48.380> you're<00:03:48.500> beginning<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:48.860> feel

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
2634 to when you're beginning to feel

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.050 
2634 to when you're beginning to feel
comfortable<00:03:49.190> start<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.209> try<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.510> speed<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> up

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
comfortable start to try and speed it up

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.979 
comfortable start to try and speed it up
whoops<00:03:53.060> even<00:03:53.630> better<00:03:53.750> than<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.989> do

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.759 

now<00:04:00.989> try<00:04:01.319> adding<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.799> pinch<00:04:02.069> on<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.000> first<00:04:03.299> beat

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
now try adding a pinch on the first beat

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.759 
now try adding a pinch on the first beat
pinch<00:04:04.939> then<00:04:05.939> go<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> base<00:04:06.510> notes<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.650> then

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
pinch then go to the base notes and then

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.740 
pinch then go to the base notes and then
start<00:04:08.069> alternating<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.760> doesn't<00:04:09.329> matter<00:04:09.510> what

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
start alternating it doesn't matter what

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.270 
start alternating it doesn't matter what
this<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> important<00:04:10.709> thing<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:11.010> giving

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
this is the important thing I'm giving

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.800 
this is the important thing I'm giving
you<00:04:11.340> string<00:04:11.579> numbers<00:04:11.879> here<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.629> long<00:04:12.780> as

you string numbers here but as long as

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.119 
you string numbers here but as long as
you're<00:04:12.989> holding<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.349> court<00:04:13.590> down<00:04:13.799> correctly

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
you're holding the court down correctly

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.370 
you're holding the court down correctly
you<00:04:14.730> can<00:04:14.879> play<00:04:15.090> any<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.780> strings<00:04:16.079> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
you can play any of the strings and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.590 
you can play any of the strings and
they'll<00:04:16.829> sound<00:04:17.070> fine<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:18.239> let's<00:04:18.389> try<00:04:18.539> this

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
they'll sound fine but let's try this

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.580 
they'll sound fine but let's try this
one<00:04:18.900> pinch<00:04:19.560> six<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.370> any<00:04:20.759> note<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.590> any

of the three high strings then the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.690 
of the three high strings then the
fourth<00:04:25.740> string<00:04:26.009> and<00:04:26.280> an<00:04:26.490> in-between<00:04:27.030> note

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.430 

of<00:04:47.270> course<00:04:47.479> we'd<00:04:47.629> never<00:04:47.810> keep<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.110> pattern<00:04:48.410> like

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
of course we'd never keep a pattern like

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.589 
of course we'd never keep a pattern like
that<00:04:48.560> going<00:04:48.889> for<00:04:49.160> as<00:04:49.220> long<00:04:49.370> as<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.729> but<00:04:50.300> it's

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
that going for as long as that but it's

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:51.640 
that going for as long as that but it's
getting<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.990> used<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.530> different

getting you used to the different
techniques<00:04:52.550> after<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.330> while<00:04:53.449> you<00:04:53.720> begin<00:04:54.289> to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
techniques after a while you begin to

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.159 
techniques after a while you begin to
apply<00:04:54.949> any<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.699> base<00:04:55.940> notes<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.449> bet<00:04:56.870> any<00:04:57.080> of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
played in between the base notes as you

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.059 
played in between the base notes as you
feel<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:07.750> something<00:05:08.750> like<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.110> now<00:05:09.919> our

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
feel it something like that now our

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.950 
feel it something like that now our
ragtime<00:05:10.520> progression

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
ragtime progression

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.560

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
to four three pinch for 6 to 4 30 or

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.720 
to four three pinch for 6 to 4 30 or
even<00:05:37.080> 6142<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.800> doesn't<00:05:39.130> matter<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.550> see

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
even 6142 it doesn't matter you see

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.520 
even 6142 it doesn't matter you see
because<00:05:40.120> I'm<00:05:40.360> holding<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.690> court<00:05:40.930> down<00:05:41.170> any

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
because I'm holding the court down any

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.410 
because I'm holding the court down any
of<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.100> top<00:05:42.280> three<00:05:42.430> strings<00:05:42.760> will<00:05:42.940> sound<00:05:43.150> fine

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
of the top three strings will sound fine

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.170 
of the top three strings will sound fine
they're<00:05:43.690> all<00:05:43.780> in<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:43.990> cord<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:48.250> was<00:05:48.490> pinched

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
they're all in the cord that was pinched

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.680 
they're all in the cord that was pinched
for<00:05:50.010> six<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.550> four<00:05:52.120> three<00:05:54.330> what<00:05:55.330> I'll<00:05:55.420> do<00:05:55.540> then

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
for six to four three what I'll do then

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.540 
for six to four three what I'll do then
is<00:05:55.810> I'll<00:05:55.960> simply<00:05:56.260> play<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:56.860> pattern<00:05:57.220> as<00:05:57.370> I

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
is I'll simply play that pattern as I

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.380 
is I'll simply play that pattern as I
change<00:05:57.820> each<00:05:58.000> chord<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:58.600> after<00:05:58.720> Gene

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
change each chord so after Gene

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.540 
change each chord so after Gene
I<00:06:00.480> went<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.170> e7<00:06:01.590> however<00:06:02.070> you<00:06:02.190> like<00:06:02.220> to<00:06:02.460> play

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
I went to e7 however you like to play

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.590 
I went to e7 however you like to play
seven<00:06:04.400> same<00:06:05.400> pic<00:06:05.670> pattern<00:06:06.060> because<00:06:06.390> it's<00:06:06.540> a

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
seven same pic pattern because it's a

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.350 
seven same pic pattern because it's a
different<00:06:06.720> chord<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.320> sounds<00:06:07.620> different<00:06:07.710> a

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
different chord it sounds different a

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.780 
different chord it sounds different a
seven<00:06:09.360> same<00:06:09.900> pic<00:06:10.140> pattern<00:06:10.500> but<00:06:10.890> remember<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
seven same pic pattern but remember the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.030 
seven same pic pattern but remember the
bass<00:06:11.970> note<00:06:12.240> for<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.660> family<00:06:12.930> towards<00:06:13.410> 5th

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
bass note for a family towards 5th

bass note for a family towards 5th
string<00:06:14.660> oops<00:06:16.400> and<00:06:17.400> then<00:06:18.620> de7<00:06:19.620> root<00:06:20.460> note<00:06:20.610> is

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
string oops and then de7 root note is

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.330 
string oops and then de7 root note is
the<00:06:20.910> fourth<00:06:21.450> string<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.930> teakwood<00:06:22.340> often

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
the fourth string of a teakwood often

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.220 
the fourth string of a teakwood often
because<00:06:23.640> that<00:06:23.940> means<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.240> it<00:06:24.420> busts<00:06:24.660> our

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
because that means that it busts our

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.900 
because that means that it busts our
base<00:06:25.470> would<00:06:25.620> have<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.860> go<00:06:25.950> four<00:06:26.220> three<00:06:26.250> four

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
base would have to go four three four

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.300 
base would have to go four three four
three<00:06:26.970> so<00:06:27.510> it<00:06:27.630> bumps<00:06:27.900> into<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.200> fingers<00:06:28.650> so

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
three so it bumps into the fingers so

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.790 
three so it bumps into the fingers so
very<00:06:29.730> often<00:06:30.000> guitarists<00:06:30.750> hook<00:06:31.260> the<00:06:31.470> thumb

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
very often guitarists hook the thumb

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.280 
very often guitarists hook the thumb
over<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.460> top<00:06:32.730> of<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:32.970> neck<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.360> get<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.870> 2nd

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
over the top of the neck to get the 2nd

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.650 
over the top of the neck to get the 2nd
fret<00:06:34.530> of<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:35.040> sixth<00:06:35.490> string<00:06:35.550> now<00:06:36.270> we<00:06:36.330> can<00:06:36.570> at

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
fret of the sixth string now we can at

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.340 
fret of the sixth string now we can at
the<00:06:36.750> base<00:06:36.900> that<00:06:37.140> goes<00:06:37.260> 6-4<00:06:37.950> 6-4<00:06:39.110> so<00:06:40.110> we<00:06:40.230> can

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
the base that goes 6-4 6-4 so we can

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.970 
the base that goes 6-4 6-4 so we can
play<00:06:40.500> our<00:06:40.530> same<00:06:40.860> path<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.430> achieve

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
play our same path and that achieve

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:54.370 
play our same path and that achieve
let's<00:06:46.520> play<00:06:46.730> through<00:06:46.970> one<00:06:47.090> side

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.180 

g2<00:06:55.380> finishes<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:55.980> whole<00:06:56.130> chord<00:06:57.080> so<00:06:58.080> that<00:06:58.980> last

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
g2 finishes the whole chord so that last

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.590 
g2 finishes the whole chord so that last
one<00:06:59.370> is<00:06:59.400> a<00:06:59.730> slightly<00:07:00.000> more<00:07:00.240> complicated

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
one is a slightly more complicated

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.060 
one is a slightly more complicated
pattern<00:07:01.199> but<00:07:01.320> what<00:07:01.440> I<00:07:01.470> want<00:07:01.680> you<00:07:01.770> to<00:07:01.800> really

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
pattern but what I want you to really

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.890 
pattern but what I want you to really
take<00:07:02.340> away<00:07:02.610> is<00:07:02.820> the<00:07:02.970> idea<00:07:03.300> that<00:07:03.360> as<00:07:03.660> long<00:07:03.750> as

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
take away is the idea that as long as

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.189 
take away is the idea that as long as
you<00:07:03.990> set<00:07:04.199> up<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.410> standard<00:07:05.150> base<00:07:06.150> in<00:07:06.750> rhythm

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
you set up the standard base in rhythm

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.640 
you set up the standard base in rhythm
you<00:07:07.889> can<00:07:08.100> play<00:07:08.340> anything<00:07:09.139> with<00:07:10.139> your<00:07:10.260> fingers

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
you can play anything with your fingers

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.510 
you can play anything with your fingers
a<00:07:11.030> little<00:07:12.030> south<00:07:12.510> fine<00:07:13.010> so<00:07:14.010> let's<00:07:14.190> finish<00:07:14.340> with

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
a little south fine so let's finish with

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.070 
a little south fine so let's finish with
a<00:07:14.580> different<00:07:15.000> style<00:07:15.240> something<00:07:15.810> that's<00:07:15.930> not

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
a different style something that's not

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.900 
a different style something that's not
swinging<00:07:16.410> not<00:07:16.710> ragtime<00:07:17.220> e<00:07:17.370> we're<00:07:17.610> going<00:07:17.760> to<00:07:17.820> go

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
swinging not ragtime e we're going to go

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:26.399 
swinging not ragtime e we're going to go
from<00:07:18.090> G<00:07:18.330> to<00:07:18.840> C

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.409 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.429 

it<00:07:27.039> sounds<00:07:27.369> really<00:07:27.429> nice<00:07:28.169> and<00:07:29.169> what<00:07:29.289> I<00:07:29.319> want

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:30.969 
you to do is not to try and follow

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.409 
you to do is not to try and follow
exactly<00:07:31.209> what<00:07:31.599> I'm<00:07:31.719> thinking<00:07:32.080> here<00:07:33.269> but<00:07:34.269> just

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
and get the base rocking in a steady

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.419 
and get the base rocking in a steady
rhythm<00:07:40.629> and<00:07:40.929> pay<00:07:41.169> anything<00:07:41.649> with<00:07:42.279> your
