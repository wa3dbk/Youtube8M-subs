another<00:03:53.620> way<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.010> could<00:03:54.310> wear<00:03:54.579> this<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
another way you could wear this is of

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.890 
another way you could wear this is of
course<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:58.120> like<00:03:58.299> leggings<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.690> can

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
course just like leggings and you can

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.150 
course just like leggings and you can
put<00:04:02.200> them<00:04:02.760> under<00:04:03.780> solar<00:04:04.780> shorts<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.769> can<00:04:05.980> make

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
put them under solar shorts you can make

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.520 
put them under solar shorts you can make
them<00:04:06.370> high-waisted<00:04:07.209> or<00:04:07.479> low<00:04:07.690> waisted<00:04:08.229> it

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
them high-waisted or low waisted it

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.650 
them high-waisted or low waisted it
doesn't<00:04:09.370> matter<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.299> um

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
doesn't matter so um

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.199 
doesn't matter so um
yes<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:13.080> think<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:13.739> pretty<00:04:13.980> much<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.400> but

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
yes I think that's pretty much it but

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.210 
yes I think that's pretty much it but
another<00:04:15.720> way<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:17.160> take<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:19.010> roll<00:04:20.010> it

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
another way is to take this and roll it

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.570 
another way is to take this and roll it
up<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:21.930> your<00:04:22.260> ruling<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.460> you're

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
up so that your ruling so you're

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.140 
up so that your ruling so you're
twisting<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.180> ends<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.930> you're<00:04:25.229> rolling<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
twisting the ends and you're rolling the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.930 
twisting the ends and you're rolling the
the<00:04:27.150> butt<00:04:27.630> area<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.889> don't<00:04:29.400> know<00:04:29.460> how<00:04:29.639> else<00:04:29.669> to

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
the butt area I don't know how else to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.240 
the butt area I don't know how else to
say<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.630> then<00:04:31.350> you're<00:04:31.710> going<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.949> kind

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
