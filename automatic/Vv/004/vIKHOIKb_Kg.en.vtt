00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.059
 Hello my dear, thank you for 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.170
 78 subscribers and I have the same today 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.820
 a new video for you 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.710
 I have my husband on the weekend 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.259
 asked me a few headphones 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.849
 buy wirelessly because if mine 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.259
 own or other child on the sofa 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.790
 I do not want to sleep on it 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.619
 refrain from watching TV and watch TV 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.840
 Just wanted a few headphones 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.599
 buy let me say 20 30 euro 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.770
 because of me also 50 degrees what he 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.950
 brought has indeed it was in reasonable reiser 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.309
 Rs 170 I hope the packaging and 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.410
 thinks 199 euro is crazy as a total 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.929
 but I have to honestly say it has 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.359
 was worth more than worthwhile for this 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.230
 headphones get absolutely full from me 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.539
 score 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.249
 I already had some of thomson 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.629
 That is already a few years 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.690
 I also have some here 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.640
 taken and here by sennheiser there 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.120
 there was an action last week now 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.739
 in our video jakob that was eleven 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.539
 percent on everything and then he still has 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.640
 a good price so everything in 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:10.580
 all 170 euros this sennheiser rs 170 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.190
 Incidentally, there are already in Amazon 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.200
 from 160 euro that is really a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
 top prize it is a lot of money 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 but I do not have these anymore 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.030
 Deposed I have to say honestly on 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.160
 weekend 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.720
 we had a movie between them 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.350
 Welten or so I can too 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.000
 recommend 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.830
 then we borrowed over 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.340
 this running pace and there I have yesterday 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.310
 evening of course tried the same 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.850
 Sensational sound it is indeed first 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.010
 getting used to these headphones 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.460
 I'll shut you up this time 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.090
 on 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 So they have this jacket with 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.229
 imitation leather on the earcup so 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.390
 Lie very well on the ear 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.750
 rum and its course appears almost 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.880
 completely the whole external noise 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.930
 if you said something I have it 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 not understood 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 So that was really great there are 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.509
 this headphone virtually no noise 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 These headphones have surround 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.430
 film or music, it is 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.119
 you have to switch off and you have 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.770
 a few buttons 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.890
 I will do it all to you some 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.080
 Show as the only - what I contribute 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 found this headphones is the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.700
 key arrangement and I have the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.890
 Amazon reviews from the customers 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.569
 Read a bit and they see that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.120
 like me that is the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.950
 Button arrangement is on the right earphone 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.200
 so they are also named right 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.989
 and left and you have it relatively fast 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 out but the first 20 times I had to 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.769
 really take the headphones off to loud 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 or to be able to make it quiet 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.209
 because right between the loud and quiet 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.440
 button is the one and 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.510
 switch off so the ambient noise 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.480
 are almost completely hidden by 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.170
 the upholstery of the earcups in total 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.360
 is that really very good on the head 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.100
 adapted one can regulate the super with 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.150
 all the stuff you get out of there and 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.670
 can pull in 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.170
 it is not possible the earcups 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.120
 to turn it completely so that you like that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.340
 I can put on a dj too 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.970
 read in reviews but yes synonymous 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.709
 not be 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.900
 So I'm very happy if that 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.030
 normal on my head and it is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.859
 There is also a padding directly above 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.590
 I'll show you that again in the video film 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.260
 so that's just the only time 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.820
 Minus point is this key assignment 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.030
 on the right earphone 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.030
 there it is really 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.100
 so the loud and quiet button exactly 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.530
 above and below the on and off 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.240
 sste sits and there is also 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.040
 a tip from the internet you should 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.410
 put a small slide on the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.450
 and switch off then you feel it 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.030
 with the finger so immediately that it is one 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.489
 off and up is loud and down below 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.980
 is the soft key down below 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.140
 there are two more buttons and that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.920
 the mood for films and 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.140
 music is there and the bass button so you 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.920
 can also regulate that extra again 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.300
 it's all there so all settings 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.530
 can be directly on the headphones 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.680
 make volume pass to the rhombus 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.840
 and one and so comfortable it 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.269
 Literally, I have to say that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.069
 transmission quality does not fluctuate at all 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.620
 Of course that digitizes everything 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.660
 So yes, I'm not asking 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.850
 no technique freak or somehow no 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.340
 professional so it really is 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.750
 Top you can at this 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.940
 headphones from sennheiser four headphones 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.110
 operate with a sending unit so 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.540
 I think that's another one too 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.360
 huge plus point I'm totally 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.080
 convinced of the design of the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.010
 wearing comfort of the raumklang music 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.950
 sound experience 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.789
 I'm not listening to the classical 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.950
 the headphones 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.510
 but if you have movies , for example 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.400
 I do not go to the cinema that much 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.010
 I leave the films over loads of 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.320
 amazon, who comes here my video about it 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.850
 make who have a video about it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.380
 would you like to tell me? 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.539
 I am in the comments 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 there especially 1 and as I said there we had 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.620
 yesterday between the worlds and it was 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.350
 yes, such an adventure movie a bit 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.590
 futuristic and there was the ambient sound 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.660
 sensational 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.210
 you will not hear outside anymore 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.520
 a lot of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.350
 everything is hidden and I found 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.880
 my husband laughs me that way 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.720
 because I'm only with the whole time 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.940
 the headphones rumrennen reach 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.800
 I can say that is up to 30 40 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.789
 meter should work when the turn 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.680
 not too fat 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.020
 I have not tried yet 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.460
 no big distances here but there 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.979
 you can also with the amazon 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.830
 read customer reviews again 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.199
 and therefore there is this device 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.210
 actually until this key assignment 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.550
 but you felt with these little felt 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.979
 things can change quite fast there are 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.199
 There are no negative points I now 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.949
 find it all on the headphones 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.110
 regulate 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:53.919
 It is very comfortable looking fancy 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.630
 Price also fits and if you like that 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.310
