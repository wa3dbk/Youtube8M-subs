pretty cool wing mount that clamps onto
your<00:00:55.330> wing<00:00:55.480> strut<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.020> then<00:00:57.630> something<00:00:58.630> out

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
your wing strut and then something out

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.420 
your wing strut and then something out
there<00:00:59.020> hooks<00:00:59.350> on<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.070> can<00:01:00.250> like

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
there hooks on to that so you can like

there hooks on to that so you can like
Scott<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.360> do<00:01:01.510> forward<00:01:01.960> back<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
Scott you do forward back at the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.770 
Scott you do forward back at the
airplane<00:01:02.770> like<00:01:02.980> out<00:01:03.160> there<00:01:03.340> looking<00:01:03.670> at<00:01:03.820> her

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
airplane like out there looking at her

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.600 
airplane like out there looking at her
backwards<00:01:05.020> or<00:01:05.350> down<00:01:05.500> or<00:01:05.710> whatever<00:01:05.800> pretty

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
backwards or down or whatever pretty

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:18.210 
backwards or down or whatever pretty
cool<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.720> technically<00:01:16.800> needed<00:01:17.800> some<00:01:17.979> kind<00:01:18.160> of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
cool so technically needed some kind of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.719 
cool so technically needed some kind of
a<00:01:18.280> safety<00:01:18.520> cable<00:01:18.850> on<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.240> or<00:01:19.360> something<00:01:20.729> then

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
a safety cable on it or something then

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.130 
a safety cable on it or something then
if<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.970> falls<00:01:22.210> off<00:01:22.420> its<00:01:22.630> gonna<00:01:22.780> head<00:01:22.960> on<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
if it falls off its gonna head on the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
if it falls off its gonna head on the
Caleb<00:01:23.470> gonna<00:01:23.650> beat<00:01:23.830> your<00:01:24.009> airplane<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.369> death

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.140 

that's<00:01:28.270> interesting

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that's interesting

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.370 
that's interesting
plus<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.330> don't<00:01:31.420> get<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> audio<00:01:31.960> if<00:01:32.110> it's<00:01:32.259> out

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
plus you don't get the audio if it's out

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:48.960 
plus you don't get the audio if it's out
there<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:34.619> run<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.650> really<00:01:35.950> long<00:01:36.130> cord<00:01:47.880> look<00:01:48.880> at

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
there to run a really long cord look at

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.130 
there to run a really long cord look at
that<00:01:49.120> right<00:01:49.270> there<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.540> looks<00:01:49.690> like<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.840> runway

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
that right there it looks like a runway

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
that right there it looks like a runway
I've<00:01:50.950> never<00:01:51.159> noticed<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.550> before
