00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.220
 without warning the pictures attacked 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.460
 a train driver suddenly scenes one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.230
 seemed solid 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.480
 Almost every locomotive driver has in his 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.690
 Career career suicide or 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.860
 accident running track the pictures he wants on 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.300
 Dearest never see again 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.849
 if they are lucky then they land 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 Patients here vital clinic bad malente 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.710
 the only clinic nationwide 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.470
 targeted by post traumatized locomotive drivers 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.050
 The courses have been booked for years 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.610
 but only a fraction of the affected 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.010
 ever goes into the hands of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.720
 professionals turn the threshold into one 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.129
 Psychosomatic clinic is to go 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.859
 Of course, much higher than in one 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.109
 normal cheeky rehabilitation clinic sounds like that 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.350
 we are a normal reha clinic with 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.929
 this special subject area the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.600
 Atmosphere smells like it swells 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.800
 right at the beginning of the week 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 stay it goes to the thing 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.980
 The head defends itself with all understanding 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.950
 against the accident 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 sometimes he even denies it like hell 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.580
 a blind with the view now piece 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.590
 made free on the happening 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.899
 This is new in the treatment of difficult 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.420
 traumatized behind this little 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.490
 room notes up to eight train drivers 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.840
 She often recognizes complaints she is here 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.649
 that you are not with your illness 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 are alone 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.119
 many are suffering so much 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.619
 that changes in theirs 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.420
 Job stops working 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.000
 a transfer within one 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 Business often means 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.110
 financial deterioration that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.329
 privacy immensely strained two 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 therapists accompany the group the 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.670
 diploma psychologist ludger berghaus and 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.659
 andreas brick the task of 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.450
 Patients in this dream 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.390
 confrontation is before her 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.490
 inner eye once again exactly that 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.829
 to present an event and also with 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.329
 everything you felt at that time what 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.490
 they have seen what they have heard 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.320
 that they also smelled or tasted 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.820
 to have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.640
 and that naturally leads to the fact that the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.120
 tension is very high and the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.780
 Patients stick to it 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.400
 Memories give the possibilities 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.390
 no longer so strong in her 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.920
 to be present 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.230
 this picture has a locomotive guide in the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.630
 accompanying art therapy painted sail 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.430
 In the storm he called it riot in 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.780
 oneself 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.910
 Talk about the accident only 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
 here in four eyes instead of many 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.900
 Patients initially try to get up 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.239
 others kneel and others kneel 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.069
 need to excite things in the excitement 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.069
 hold hand and knead doll 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.390
 the image or the idea is that ours 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.130
 brain our memory is so structured 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.160
 like a wardrobe where it is 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.470
 There are different compartments and drawers 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.010
 where the memories are sorted 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.450
 become 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.910
 And if we have something of the memory 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.780
 we can do that 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.810
 access 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.850
 now it is like that at one 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.460
 traumatic event far too many 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.340
 memories too many impressions on 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.400
 pour in the affected and that he 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.500
 in principle all the impressions somehow 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.540
 tried in the wardrobe 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.200
 to get in and thus all tremendous 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.510
 for have the door to push around so on 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.080
 somehow capable of action in everyday life too 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.810
 stay 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.790
 in other countries it tells 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.250
 clinic management is suicidal 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.710
 to be socially rejected would be suicide 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.960
 make the sun is not do it yourself 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.650
 others with hot tears are there 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.710
 clearly 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.510
 Malente has a balance sheet we have there 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.160
 We do not have any official numbers yet 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.360
 a science evolution man 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.710
 Do not do it but a little longer 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.710
 back must also 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.210
 experience reports others that the 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.640
 cure or better odds to 80 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.200
 percent are a certain procedure 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.850
 in the therapy is chosen that is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.710
 so one directly from a fair to with 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.600
 accident trauma or accident 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.910
 traumata is done that there really 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.420
 improvement of 80 degrees percent 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.420
 are expected 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.049
 50 percent of the treated get the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.980
 head so free that you have a train again 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.980
 can control
