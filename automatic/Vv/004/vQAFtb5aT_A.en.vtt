we<00:01:08.040> multiply<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.840> number<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.009> two

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
we multiply this number that is two

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
we multiply this number that is two
three<00:01:11.460> four<00:01:11.670> by<00:01:12.240> 42<00:01:12.899> in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.289> faster<00:01:13.830> way<00:01:15.049> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
three four by 42 in a faster way the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
three four by 42 in a faster way the
general<00:01:16.409> method<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> multiplication<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.700> know

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
general method of multiplication we know

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
general method of multiplication we know
how<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.149> we<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> 234<00:01:20.190> into<00:01:21.030> 42<00:01:21.509> we

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
how do we do it that is 234 into 42 we

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.210 
how do we do it that is 234 into 42 we
multiply<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.649> one<00:01:22.830> length<00:01:23.009> by<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.950> again

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
multiply in one length by two we again

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.840 
multiply in one length by two we again
multiply<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.909> four<00:01:27.149> we<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.750> another<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
multiply by four we get another one and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
multiply by four we get another one and
when<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.970> add<00:01:30.119> these<00:01:30.330> numbers<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
when we add these numbers we get the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.570 
when we add these numbers we get the
third<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.789> answer<00:01:33.179> figure<00:01:34.580> now

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
third one which is my answer figure now

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.520 
third one which is my answer figure now
the<00:01:35.640> same<00:01:35.909> answer<00:01:36.330> figure<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.810> should<00:01:36.899> get<00:01:37.350> in

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the same answer figure I should get in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.130 
the same answer figure I should get in
one<00:01:37.830> length<00:01:38.270> how<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.140> this

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
one length how do we do it look at this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
one length how do we do it look at this
unit<00:01:43.140> isn't<00:01:43.640> it's<00:01:44.780> too<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> multiply<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
unit isn't it's too so multiply it to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.930 
unit isn't it's too so multiply it to
the<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.929> first<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.709> this<00:01:50.580> number

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
the very first is it off this number

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:03.430 
the very first is it off this number
that<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> 4<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.799> 4<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.369> 4<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.770> 8<00:01:57.440> next<00:01:58.940> 2<00:02:00.950> into<00:02:01.970> 3

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
that is 4 so 4 into 4 is 8 next 2 into 3

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.270 
that is 4 so 4 into 4 is 8 next 2 into 3
plus<00:02:04.440> 4<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:05.729> 4<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> 2<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:09.270> 3<00:02:09.509> plus<00:02:10.280> 4

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
plus 4 into 4 and if it 2 into 3 plus 4

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.040 
plus 4 into 4 and if it 2 into 3 plus 4
into<00:02:11.580> 4<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.470> 2<00:02:13.709> into<00:02:14.069> 3<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.000> 6<00:02:15.269> plus<00:02:15.709> 4<00:02:16.709> into<00:02:16.920> 4<00:02:17.250> 16

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
into 4 so 2 into 3 is 6 plus 4 into 4 16

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.470 
into 4 so 2 into 3 is 6 plus 4 into 4 16
6<00:02:19.050> plus<00:02:19.379> 16<00:02:19.830> 22<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.030> 22<00:02:21.540> carry<00:02:21.870> 2<00:02:22.459> next<00:02:23.510> 2<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.250> 4

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
6 plus 16 22 so 22 carry 2 next 2 to 4

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.460 
6 plus 16 22 so 22 carry 2 next 2 to 4
