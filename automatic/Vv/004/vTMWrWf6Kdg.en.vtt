00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:21.490 

I<00:03:19.329> chose<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.510> Orange<00:03:20.780> County<00:03:20.840> drums<00:03:21.349> and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
I chose the Orange County drums and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.800 
I chose the Orange County drums and
percussion<00:03:21.590> because<00:03:22.220> their<00:03:22.790> drum<00:03:23.030> set<00:03:23.360> has

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
percussion because their drum set has

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.610 
percussion because their drum set has
the<00:03:23.989> biggest<00:03:24.290> sound<00:03:24.709> from<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.459> drum<00:03:25.790> set<00:03:26.060> and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the biggest sound from a drum set and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.390 
the biggest sound from a drum set and
that<00:03:27.620> I've<00:03:27.799> heard<00:03:28.870> live<00:03:29.870> wise<00:03:30.200> i<00:03:30.620> get<00:03:31.129> really

this<00:04:04.280> ever<00:04:04.609> been<00:04:04.849> made<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.180> that's<00:04:05.359> what<00:04:05.510> I

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
this ever been made and that's what I

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.170 
this ever been made and that's what I
