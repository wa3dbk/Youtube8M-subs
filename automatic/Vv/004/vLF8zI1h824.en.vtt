Freddie but unfortunately that was ruled
out<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.049> believe<00:01:04.430> when<00:01:05.430> clapping<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:06.000> making

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
out I believe when clapping was making

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
out I believe when clapping was making
stamps<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.619> said<00:01:07.680> he's<00:01:08.189> actually

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
stamps but like I said he's actually

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
stamps but like I said he's actually
pretty<00:01:08.970> famous<00:01:09.450> around<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.780> island<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.290> there

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pretty famous around the island as there

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.580 
pretty famous around the island as there
was<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.100> believe<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.330> least<00:01:12.450> three<00:01:13.170> different

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
was I believe at least three different

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.880 
was I believe at least three different
newspaper<00:01:14.220> articles<00:01:14.640> written<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> him<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
newspaper articles written on him and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
newspaper articles written on him and
one<00:01:16.890> being<00:01:17.159> Antarctic<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
one being Antarctic and I think one of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
one being Antarctic and I think one of
them<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> secrets<00:01:19.580> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> newspaper

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
them was in the secrets in the newspaper

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
cool I'm gonna do it in a slow motion as
I<00:01:39.630> talk<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.200> again<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.009> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I talk over this again it was really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
I talk over this again it was really
quick<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> did<00:01:42.360> notice<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.500> clock

that's below him actually moved which
I'm<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.159> surprised<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.579> because

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
I'm pretty surprised about because

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.170 
I'm pretty surprised about because
normally<00:01:48.299> any<00:01:48.540> saw<00:01:49.049> any<00:01:49.470> sort<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.149> thing<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
normally any saw any sort of thing that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
normally any saw any sort of thing that
small<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.170> club<00:01:52.409> penguin<00:01:52.439> wouldn't<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
small in club penguin wouldn't be

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.639 
small in club penguin wouldn't be
animated<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:55.049> pretty<00:01:55.200> cool<00:01:55.409> cuz<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
animated but that's pretty cool cuz I
