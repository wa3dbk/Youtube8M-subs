00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.010
 hello very good everyone here we are a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.460
 day more and good today we bring the new 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.200
 karma skin along with his recital and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.550
 good is already in the pp available the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 truth is that we were trying on 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.150
 me for a while and it's pretty good the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 character and nothing else explain their 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.510
 skills its a little passive that have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.820
 changed and how can a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.680
 little bit in other aspects and maybe 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.619
 explains his abilities also 2 for his 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 passive the karma passive changes 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.430
 completely to what happens that poke 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 two mantras as I had before has one 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.690
 but as you go doing basic attacks 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.729
 the enemy to the enemy champion or your 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.489
 damaged styles will recover the 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.839
 cool where the r nx seconds we have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.639
 been seeing that not only in the same 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.769
 second that you recover at the beginning of 

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:45.059
 the level 1 game that at the highest level is 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.999
 say that grouping from a second 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.370
 because to skill attack and half 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:53.069
 of the same time for each attack 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 basic until we come from moments are 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.329
 joel 14 to 22 seconds we do not know until 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.469
 when will we reach level 18 but has 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.999
 It looks like this is climbing with 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 the levels that at a certain level scale a 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.040
 little bit and well that is the passive we are going to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.860
 move to the cv 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.990
 what he does is loose rollÃ¡n and dale 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.620
 release a little ball 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 throw and give and cage de luxe up to a 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.890
 point until there is an enemy and when 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.570
 enemy is helping is passive that makes 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.990
 magical damage to Indians who are 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 around 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 then empowered with the mantra makes 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.650
 different things each bile we have 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.930
 we promote in relation to things 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.920
 different to be enhanced much then 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 the normal cv does things like that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 and put a yesteryear in relatively 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.570
 small but now quite a lot of damage is that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 I have little and mix a lot and with 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.630
 mantra what will you do apart clear 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.820
 that the enemies that affect you are going to 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.159
 put slow with the command makes them a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 more powerful wave that will do more damage to poke 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.479
 to one is the greatest and after 15 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.330
 seconds will be a bit like the ball of 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.619
 luxe will explode and it will hurt you not to be told 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.880
 is in that in that area 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.330
 we have found the mantra and only 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.330
 we throw to me 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 does that damage and once they pass 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.890
 seconds ago again the damage we are going to 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.180
 move to double or calm after calm 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.990
 it's a bit like the one I had before 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.870
 that pulls the link this happens 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.490
 change to speed the allies and of 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.110
 Slow down the enemies what they do is 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.020
 that you throw it to an enemy champion 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.230
 is going to do magic damage during what 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.930
 and pollutes last time you will 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.470
 put a broken that last stream morgan to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 a little bit fake and once what is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.209
 finish the two seconds you have of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.800
 link will anchor you to the ground 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.440
 we have a little behind me that I know 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.320
 we put and if the link is not broken what 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.530
 ground anchor and with the mantra does more 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
 damage and it is healing you apart 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.640
 let's do it is to me he hit us 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.069
 little so that it took away a little bit of 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.569
 lifetime 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.310
 and now let's pull the same 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.680
 propose mantra this means 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.109
 we throw ourselves the mantra we throw 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.489
 the w and we're going to cure the 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.040
 truth to the paid doing harm and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 also surrounds let's now with the e of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.109
 karma inspire that of karma is a little 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.000
 it seemed like the one that had the only one is a 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.680
 mix with the bond that I had before is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.049
 say you put an aluminum shield on them 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.659
 ally or a champion to gain speed 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.299
 movement for a few seconds and it's going to 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.819
 just have a shield cap on damage which 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.870
 is the difference with respect to 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.849
 earlier than you are if you use it with the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.349
 mantra apart when he has safe 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.349
 after the shield is going to explode will do 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.299
 hurt the enemies around and there 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.000
 allied champions who are close 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.290
 of the objective of the shield knows the champion 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.659
 of the structure the minimum is the shield 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.549
 they are going to give half this shield this to 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.019
 steve there they go well very well and it's going to be 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.699
 pretty good work then well let's go 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.180
 to throw the normal shield we see here that 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:46.079
 it increases my speed 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.689
 and a relatively large shield too 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.609
 gives us more shields and we have the mantra and 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.140
 here we see a pose near sam and not 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.130
 let's follow the mantra we have the game 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.470
 it explodes and now pretty hurt the truth 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.850
 let's explain since the r we have already 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.870
 seen what it is that is the enhancer 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.980
 skills 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.210
 let's apply we've been seeing a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.040
 little bit what it gives up with each 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.390
 level that you target to the skill each of 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.760
 the corners then let's see by 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.700
 example the q q each level that you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.080
 auction will go up the skill damage as 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 in all corners it will be reduced 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.520
 cool down will increase the percentage 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.860
 of slow that you get and we have something 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.620
 this manna like all the drought that is the 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.960
 that we're going to spend something double the w 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.980
 will increase each time you level the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.080
 hurt 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.060
 of increasing the amount of time that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.890
 the rival is surrounded 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.870
 this is how the soil that is going to 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.560
 reduce the cool down and I have the mental 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.640
 mana and with the increase 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.010
 the speed is that it gives you the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.390
 speed of movement that gives you the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.670
 shield that will have you also increases those 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.100
 levels and mana is increased this 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.020
 it means that it will come very well 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.550
 because fuck 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.050
 let's put out a shield 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.930
 pretty billet and is still looking 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 move that to your laughter or to the one that goes to 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.800
 start it anise very well and finally 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.870
 every time we add the r we have seen 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.180
 of the tea increases enormously 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.390
 powers are going up a lot be a point 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.730
 to the air look at the go to level 17 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.530
 is very good because it will increase the 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.780
 damage pots much power raisins 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.110
 to have for example 75 would have the level 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.000
 from the cv to 125 that is 50 more damage 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.430
 They will go very well when you and check out 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.380
 empowered and nothing because this is karma 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.420
 this new bed scale will surely make 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.400
 a like to dismiss the old the 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.640
 truth is that it was not bad character to me 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.930
 I like it a lot and nothing, so tell us 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.330
 that we have also migrated from riscal 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.530
 I put here the idea of new lay 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.790
 I encourage you as you give me there is very good vibes 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.440
 there are many people and such that we 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.570
 you can with the colors and with something like 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.060
 this is so in communes we also do 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.770
 some roll events will make ambrosio such 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.050
 and nothing but that to tell you that I hope that 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.300
 like in a quite interesting calm 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.280
 and then I'll do a live of the old and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.680
 as soon as the new officer leaves for 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.330
 power to play the annul is with 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.460
 the new one that looks very good on 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.660
 all mid and good people are still around 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.620
 tito the bow facebook and no more in 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.620
 mcdonald see you later
