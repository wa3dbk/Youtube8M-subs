like 7th in the district overall and so

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.520 
like 7th in the district overall and so
when<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> came<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.690> I'm<00:00:12.780> very<00:00:12.960> explicit

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
when I came in and I'm very explicit

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.690 
when I came in and I'm very explicit
with<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> kids<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> people<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.549> low

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
with the kids that people have low

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
with the kids that people have low
expectations<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> guys<00:00:16.020> oftentimes

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
expectations for you guys oftentimes

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.870 
expectations for you guys oftentimes
they<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.039> low<00:00:17.160> expectations<00:00:17.430> for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
they have low expectations for

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.189 
they have low expectations for
themselves<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.810> high<00:00:18.930> expectations

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
themselves but I have high expectations

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.490 
themselves but I have high expectations
and<00:00:19.939> not<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.720> well<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> improve

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and not just to do well and to improve

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
and not just to do well and to improve
but<00:00:22.769> eventually<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.279> want<00:00:23.730> our<00:00:23.820> school<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> be

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
but eventually I want our school to be

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.820 
but eventually I want our school to be
the<00:00:24.359> marquee<00:00:24.689> school<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.439> never<00:00:25.470> talked<00:00:25.800> about

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the marquee school we never talked about

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.099 
the marquee school we never talked about
350<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> pass<00:00:26.970> right<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> Casa<00:00:27.689> doesn't

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
350 a pass right on the Casa doesn't

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
350 a pass right on the Casa doesn't
mean<00:00:28.230> anything<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:28.710> ultimately<00:00:29.429> we're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
mean anything because ultimately we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
mean anything because ultimately we're
measured<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.240> how<00:00:30.570> much<00:00:30.840> kids<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
measured on how much kids we have that

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
measured on how much kids we have that
proficiency<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.489> don't<00:00:32.880> even<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.180> they

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
proficiency I don't even think they

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.340 
proficiency I don't even think they
could<00:00:33.450> tell<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.899> ask<00:00:33.930> them<00:00:34.140> what's<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
could tell you if you ask them what's a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040 
could tell you if you ask them what's a
pass<00:00:34.530> rate<00:00:34.800> 380<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.840> what

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pass rate 380 which is good that's what

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
pass rate 380 which is good that's what
we<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:38.219> students<00:00:38.700> are

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
we want them to know these students are

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
we want them to know these students are
so<00:00:39.140> intelligent<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.739> they<00:00:41.219> didn't<00:00:41.520> know

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so intelligent and they they didn't know

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.610
