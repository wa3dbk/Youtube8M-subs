legacies<00:01:40.380> aside<00:01:40.710> t-bo's<00:01:41.130> media<00:01:41.549> attention<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
legacies aside t-bo's media attention is

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
legacies aside t-bo's media attention is
made<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> hot<00:01:43.200> commodity<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.860> for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
made in kind of a hot commodity so for

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.039 
made in kind of a hot commodity so for
the<00:01:44.130> short<00:01:44.399> term<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.780> sell

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the short term I think that will sell

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
the short term I think that will sell
and<00:01:46.310> obviously<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:47.579> never<00:01:47.700> gonna<00:01:47.909> see

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and obviously we're never gonna see

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
and obviously we're never gonna see
these<00:01:48.299> two<00:01:48.450> face<00:01:48.689> off<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.259> that's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
these two face off but I think that's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
these two face off but I think that's
what<00:01:49.829> makes<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.250> harder<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> into

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
what makes it harder to put this into

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
what makes it harder to put this into
perspective<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.110> 1<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> 100<00:01:52.950> scale<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
perspective it's a 1 to 100 scale here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
perspective it's a 1 to 100 scale here
so<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> weight<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> numbers<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> heavy

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so the weight of the numbers is heavy

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
so the weight of the numbers is heavy
and<00:01:55.320> unfortunately<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.340> part<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and unfortunately I think part of the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
and unfortunately I think part of the
discussion<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.600> how<00:01:58.049> heavy<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.860> or

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
discussion here is how heavy that is or

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
discussion here is how heavy that is or
is<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> actual<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.479> when<00:02:01.350> that's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is not in the actual game when that's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
is not in the actual game when that's
being<00:02:01.860> played<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.430> first<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> foremost<00:02:03.600> Tim

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
being played so first and foremost Tim

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.100 
being played so first and foremost Tim
Tebow<00:02:04.619> 15<00:02:05.219> faster<00:02:05.729> than<00:02:05.880> Montana<00:02:06.270> Montana<00:02:06.750> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
Tebow 15 faster than Montana Montana is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
Tebow 15 faster than Montana Montana is
actually<00:02:07.409> 76<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> higher<00:02:08.580> than<00:02:08.610> average

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
actually 76 which is higher than average

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
actually 76 which is higher than average
for<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.300> quarterback<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.259> understand<00:02:10.950> what

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
for a quarterback so I understand what

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.730 
for a quarterback so I understand what
they're<00:02:11.220> getting

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
they're getting

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.800 
they're getting
there<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.340> strength<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.090> guess<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.660> where

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
there but the strength I guess is where

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.560 
there but the strength I guess is where
we<00:02:13.930> sharp<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.440> some<00:02:14.650> issues<00:02:15.150> 93<00:02:16.150> seems

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
we sharp to see some issues 93 seems

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.830 
we sharp to see some issues 93 seems
extremely<00:02:16.990> high<00:02:17.200> for<00:02:17.260> Tebow<00:02:18.270> 53<00:02:19.270> kind<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
extremely high for Tebow 53 kind of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.690 
extremely high for Tebow 53 kind of
seems<00:02:20.020> very<00:02:20.230> low<00:02:20.530> for<00:02:20.740> Montana<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.430> hard

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
seems very low for Montana and it's hard

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.250 
seems very low for Montana and it's hard
for<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.970> quarterback<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.480> show<00:02:22.840> his<00:02:22.990> strength

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
for a quarterback to show his strength

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
for a quarterback to show his strength
you<00:02:23.980> know<00:02:24.070> keep<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.430> mind<00:02:24.610> throwing<00:02:24.940> power<00:02:25.210> is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
you know keep in mind throwing power is

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.660 
you know keep in mind throwing power is
a<00:02:25.510> separate<00:02:25.900> attribute<00:02:26.320> here<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:26.980> guess<00:02:27.310> you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
a separate attribute here so I guess you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.580 
a separate attribute here so I guess you
know<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.030> may<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.720> give<00:02:28.900> Tebow<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.470> edge

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
know you may have to give Tebow the edge

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.260 
know you may have to give Tebow the edge
simply<00:02:29.950> because<00:02:30.220> he<00:02:30.370> exposed<00:02:30.820> himself<00:02:31.030> to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
simply because he exposed himself to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.300 
simply because he exposed himself to
more<00:02:31.480> hits<00:02:31.750> than<00:02:31.990> Montana<00:02:32.530> did<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:32.950> you're

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
more hits than Montana did but you're

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.560 
more hits than Montana did but you're
already<00:02:33.550> starting<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.210> some<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
already starting to see some of the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690 
already starting to see some of the
selectiveness<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.410> flaws<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.400> hinder

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
selectiveness and the flaws that hinder

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.880 
selectiveness and the flaws that hinder
this<00:02:36.820> process<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.600> I'll<00:02:38.050> spare<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> some<00:02:38.620> of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
this process and I'll spare you some of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.230 
this process and I'll spare you some of
these<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.430> look<00:02:39.850> at<00:02:39.970> them<00:02:40.060> for

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
these and you can look at them for

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.610 
these and you can look at them for
yourself<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.140> things<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.500> really

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
yourself but the things that really

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
yourself but the things that really
stood<00:02:41.920> out<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.220> me<00:02:42.250> Tim<00:02:42.610> Tebow<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.180> higher

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
stood out to me Tim Tebow to higher

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.260 
stood out to me Tim Tebow to higher
awareness<00:02:43.990> than<00:02:44.170> Joe<00:02:44.290> Montana<00:02:44.650> had<00:02:45.520> nine<00:02:45.910> more

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
awareness than Joe Montana had nine more

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.270 
awareness than Joe Montana had nine more
throwing<00:02:46.780> power<00:02:46.930> which<00:02:47.560> really<00:02:47.920> only<00:02:48.100> meant

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
throwing power which really only meant

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.490 
throwing power which really only meant
that<00:02:48.400> Tebow<00:02:48.760> hit<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> cap<00:02:49.240> at<00:02:49.450> 99<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:49.960> warded

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
that Tebow hit the cap at 99 and warded

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.080 
that Tebow hit the cap at 99 and warded
the<00:02:50.620> cap<00:02:50.800> at<00:02:50.980> 100<00:02:51.400> however<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> want<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:51.970> play

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
the cap at 100 however you want to play

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.970 
the cap at 100 however you want to play
that<00:02:52.300> card<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.290> same<00:02:53.500> breath<00:02:53.740> let's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
that card but in the same breath let's

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.570 
that card but in the same breath let's
also<00:02:54.160> understand<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.970> Montana<00:02:55.750> was<00:02:56.530> 95<00:02:57.310> or

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
also understand that Montana was 95 or

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580 
also understand that Montana was 95 or
higher<00:02:57.820> overall<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.660> accuracies<00:02:59.200> across

higher overall that accuracies across

higher overall that accuracies across
the<00:02:59.860> board<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.580> Tebow<00:03:01.030> trailed<00:03:01.360> by<00:03:01.540> 11<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.320> all

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the board in Tebow trailed by 11 in all

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.410 
the board in Tebow trailed by 11 in all
the<00:03:02.680> deep<00:03:02.920> accuracy<00:03:03.550> where<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:03.760> gave<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.150> five

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the deep accuracy where he gave up five

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.090 
the deep accuracy where he gave up five
and<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.750> shows<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.020> small<00:03:05.560> windows<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and this shows the small windows that

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.560 
and this shows the small windows that

is<00:03:13.720> critical<00:03:14.380> for<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.920> quarterback<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> be

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
is critical for a quarterback to be

successful<00:03:16.240> in<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.390> NFL<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.750> think<00:03:16.840> shows<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
successful in the NFL I think shows the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.530 
successful in the NFL I think shows the
larger<00:03:17.770> issue<00:03:17.950> maybe<00:03:18.700> even<00:03:19.000> more<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.510> fact

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
larger issue maybe even more so the fact

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.780 
larger issue maybe even more so the fact
that<00:03:19.810> Tebow<00:03:20.260> was<00:03:20.740> more<00:03:20.980> than<00:03:21.130> likely<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.490> better

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
that Tebow was more than likely a better

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.760 
that Tebow was more than likely a better
pure<00:03:22.120> athlete<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.230> not<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> better

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
pure athlete but not a better

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.100 
pure athlete but not a better
quarterback<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.760> we<00:03:25.180> see<00:03:25.360> here<00:03:25.540> man<00:03:25.750> really

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
quarterback and we see here man really

quarterback and we see here man really
struggles<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.830> quantify<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.580> with<00:03:27.760> all

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910

struggles to quantify that with all
these<00:03:28.030> numbers<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.600> think<00:03:28.630> that's<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.140> core

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
these numbers I think that's the core

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.040 
these numbers I think that's the core
problem<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.460> you<00:03:30.790> know<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.510> can<00:03:31.690> run<00:03:31.840> through

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
problem so you know you can run through

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.840 
problem so you know you can run through
the<00:03:32.230> other<00:03:32.350> stats<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.830> you'd<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.670> can

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
the other stats if you'd like you can

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.490 
the other stats if you'd like you can
pick<00:03:34.030> apart<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.450> play-action<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.290> end<00:03:35.410> of
