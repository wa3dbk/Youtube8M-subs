00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.620
 act of being beaten by the mis 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.559
 I tried to die again and again 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.709
 result with desire to throw the footprint 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 through the window until the eggs to see 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:18.060
 that is not able to kill a miser me 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the very severe intrepid jump I am 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 as priÃ­sta and it is the immunity to the temple 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.009
 of time I bring this video to you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 teach you how to get up to 21 years 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.929
 in intrepid assault mode or also 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.390
 known as cruel is more than super 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.250
 smash bros for wii u and so get 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.250
 the challenges in this way 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 for this we will use our hero 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 preferred link once the assault begins 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.059
 we go to one of the sides to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 have more controlled our ours already 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.470
 that in this way they can only attack us 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 from the side while if we 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.750
 we are in the center we will be prey of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 a very interesting vessel for 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.400
 defeating the link we have with my 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.190
 two ways of doing it one by taking the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 with the hook and throwing them into space and 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.020
 another with no link recovery 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.750
 I think this is the safest way 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 to get this but it's the best way 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.460
 that I found when we got into one of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.649
 the edges we will have to grab our 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 enemies keeping the trigger with the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.479
 that we use the barrier and pressing the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 button a in this way we will win to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.060
 our adversaries with much more 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 security when using the shield 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.640
 then we just jump in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.619
 back this this does not always have to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 go well and sometimes our 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.790
 adversaries come back but you have to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.190
 insist and have a lot of patience 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.480
 the other way is as I said with the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.850
 Inc recovery 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.620
 once the same ones have been thrown out 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.260
 we can take advantage of this to press 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.080
 above you see more on the edge but also 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.790
 we do it in the right way 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.680
 we will finish with our mixed 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.830
 for this we do the recovery 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.420
 pressing up + b we move a little bit 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.880
 the stick towards the direction where 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.070
 we want to send our adversaries and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 At the same time, we try to return to the field of 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.150
 battle by moving the stick towards him 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.880
 is the battlefield this way 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.450
 it may be more complicated but it is very 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.100
 very effective combining these two ways 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.300
 in the end we will achieve a whopping 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.140
 amount of 21 that you 21 chaos in the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.180
 intrepid assault and well cedars what 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.980
 record taste in this mode leave it to me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 the comments we see in the average 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.709
 from here in the temple of time that the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.709
 trifuerza accompany you
