the first two conditioners i have i'm
going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.219> these<00:00:44.340> together<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:45.480> these

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
going to do these together because these

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.799 
going to do these together because these
are<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> brew<00:00:46.559> conditioners<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> these

basically are called broom because the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically are called broom because the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
first ingredient is beer and the one is
hydrating<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.690> smoothing<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> an

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
hydrating one is smoothing this is an

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.970 
hydrating one is smoothing this is an
IPA<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> barley<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> hops<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.530> don't

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
IPA and this is barley and hops I don't

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
IPA and this is barley and hops I don't
see<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> difference<00:00:59.399> between<00:01:00.000> any<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> room

yeah last one I have the Indian hemp and
tomorrow<00:05:43.100> I<00:05:43.370> think<00:05:43.729> that's<00:05:44.030> how<00:05:44.150> you

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
tomorrow I think that's how you

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.760 
tomorrow I think that's how you
pronounce<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:44.540> growth<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.260> strengthened

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
pronounce that growth and strengthened

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.010 
pronounce that growth and strengthened
treatment<00:05:46.310> now<00:05:46.460> this<00:05:47.449> is<00:05:47.600> like<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.750> really

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
treatment now this is like a really

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.620 
treatment now this is like a really
thick<00:05:48.590> masses<00:05:49.520> would<00:05:49.729> be<00:05:49.940> protein

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
thick masses would be protein

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.170 
thick masses would be protein
conditioner<00:05:51.560> on<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.100> that's<00:05:52.520> pretty<00:05:52.760> much<00:05:52.880> to

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
conditioner on and that's pretty much to

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.460 
conditioner on and that's pretty much to
me<00:05:53.300> this<00:05:53.419> pretty<00:05:53.660> much<00:05:53.780> what<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.020> is<00:05:54.139> I<00:05:54.290> did

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470
