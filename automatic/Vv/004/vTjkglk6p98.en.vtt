00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
basically Happy Feet 2 is pretty much

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.190 
basically Happy Feet 2 is pretty much
the<00:03:01.049> most<00:03:01.530> simplistic<00:03:01.890> version<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:03.200> Happy

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the most simplistic version of Happy

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.289 
the most simplistic version of Happy
Feet<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:04.769> possibly<00:03:04.920> could<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.579> this

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
Feet that there possibly could be this

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.869 
Feet that there possibly could be this
game<00:03:06.510> would<00:03:06.750> only<00:03:06.959> appeal<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.620> very<00:03:08.519> young

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
game would only appeal to very young

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.110 
game would only appeal to very young
children<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.870> probably<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.980> adults<00:03:11.280> it's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
children and probably not to adults it's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.569 
children and probably not to adults it's
not<00:03:12.420> say<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.140> adults<00:03:13.859> couldn't<00:03:14.099> play<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
not say that adults couldn't play it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.130 
not say that adults couldn't play it
it's<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.450> doesn't<00:03:15.480> offer<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it's just that it doesn't offer the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.800 
it's just that it doesn't offer the
challenge<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.250> difficulty<00:03:17.849> therein<00:03:18.599> to
