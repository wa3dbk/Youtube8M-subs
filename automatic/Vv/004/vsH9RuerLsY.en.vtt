00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
guide is greater demons by the title

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.550 
guide is greater demons by the title
obviously<00:00:16.640> but<00:00:17.210> greater<00:00:17.779> demons<00:00:18.140> are<00:00:18.230> kind<00:00:18.410> of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
obviously but greater demons are kind of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.980 
obviously but greater demons are kind of
unique<00:00:19.220> in<00:00:19.550> my<00:00:19.670> eyes<00:00:19.880> because<00:00:20.240> you<00:00:20.869> pretty

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
unique in my eyes because you pretty

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.560 
unique in my eyes because you pretty
much<00:00:21.140> for<00:00:21.410> hit<00:00:21.560> them<00:00:21.710> so<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.420> don't<00:00:23.420> really

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
much for hit them so I don't really

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.509 
much for hit them so I don't really
think<00:00:23.660> there's<00:00:24.019> pretty<00:00:24.470> much<00:00:24.529> any<00:00:24.980> reason<00:00:25.490> to

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
think there's pretty much any reason to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.329 
think there's pretty much any reason to
use<00:00:25.669> abilities<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.539> these<00:00:26.810> guys<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.410> what<00:00:28.220> i'm

adrenaline<00:00:35.690> bar<00:00:35.870> is<00:00:36.020> filled<00:00:36.320> I'm<00:00:36.680> using<00:00:37.100> the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
adrenaline bar is filled I'm using the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.670 
adrenaline bar is filled I'm using the
ultimate<00:00:38.570> ability<00:00:38.780> called<00:00:39.350> momentum

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
ultimate ability called momentum

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.670 
ultimate ability called momentum
momentum<00:00:40.550> pretty<00:00:41.149> much<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.660> if<00:00:41.989> you're<00:00:42.410> AF

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you don't really need any kind of cell

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.310 
you don't really need any kind of cell
splitting<00:01:25.100> at<00:01:25.220> all<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:26.390> main<00:01:26.540> reason<00:01:26.930> why<00:01:27.080> I'm

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
splitting at all the main reason why I'm

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.780 
splitting at all the main reason why I'm
actually<00:01:27.500> ranging<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.310> because<00:01:28.610> they're

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
actually ranging is because they're

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.610 
actually ranging is because they're
actually<00:01:29.240> week<00:01:29.390> two<00:01:29.540> bolts<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.230> price<00:01:30.410> of

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
actually week two bolts and the price of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.320 
actually week two bolts and the price of
bolts<00:01:30.920> right<00:01:31.040> now<00:01:31.190> are<00:01:31.400> pretty<00:01:32.210> much

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
bolts right now are pretty much

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.090 
bolts right now are pretty much
skyrocketing<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.110> think<00:01:33.350> that<00:01:33.500> royal<00:01:33.710> bolts

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
skyrocketing I think that royal bolts

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.180 
skyrocketing I think that royal bolts
are<00:01:34.330> about<00:01:35.330> 300<00:01:35.690> h<00:01:36.050> possibly<00:01:36.650> more<00:01:36.830> when<00:01:37.160> I

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
are about 300 h possibly more when I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.400 
are about 300 h possibly more when I
tried<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.490> buy<00:01:37.760> them<00:01:38.020> they<00:01:39.020> weren't<00:01:39.230> buying

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
tried to buy them they weren't buying

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.800 
tried to buy them they weren't buying
it's<00:01:39.860> kind<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.130> funny<00:01:40.370> though<00:01:40.460> how<00:01:40.820> something

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's kind of funny though how something

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.980 
it's kind of funny though how something
that's<00:01:41.990> like<00:01:42.080> 25<00:01:42.350> gph<00:01:43.010> and<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:43.340> 300<00:01:43.880> gph<00:01:44.270> how

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that's like 25 gph and now 300 gph how

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.140
