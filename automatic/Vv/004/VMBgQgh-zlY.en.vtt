00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.899
 eclairs today we have a review on 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.099
 wonderful fighter of the fifth level 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.740
 messerschmitt bf-109 e 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.290
 Emil this plane loved enough 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.230
 many players are likely to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 come from the fact that it is enough 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 balanced and its characteristics 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 very nice let's consider them 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.430
 in detail so let's go durability 200 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 units not so much for the fifth 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.439
 level firepower represented 15 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.289
 millimeter cannon 4 machine guns 792 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.480
 which is 120 one fire unit 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 power speed is one of the best at 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.700
 it is exactly on a par with the altitude 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.879
 sets the tone of the game on this plane 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.010
 equals 517 units maneuverability 292 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.660
 units from which it is enough for us to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.430
 dock heavy fighters and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 some light fighters but by this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.039
 you shouldn't get carried away 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 altitude nineteen fifty 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.719
 meters what is one of the best 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 level indicators for 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 small-caliber machine guns set 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.140
 armor piercing incendiary tapes and for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 guns install armor piercing also 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 we install 120 octane gasoline i 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.799
 necessarily restart the engine 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.890
 Often knocks out the last slot you can 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540
 put what you want from modules a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 advice first thing to pump 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 engines further motor armament it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.650
 millimeter cannon feeder which 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
 very well with the wings of them 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 small - caliber machine guns 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.430
 This is the setup I advise arms 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.380
 on this wing fighter 20 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 graph paper you will have open if 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 you pumped Focke Woolf there is no 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.009
 you can pump them too 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.860
 case on other planes 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.420
 mom no, too, will not be superfluous of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.119
 equipment I advise you to put a sight 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 varnish coating and hard plating on 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.420
 this we all have with a hangar and let's 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 let's go fight and so the fight goes on the map 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.490
 arctic team setups mostly consist 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 from saucers and for myself I singled out 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 priority is first regular airplanes 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 who are the branch so how exactly 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.250
 they are particularly dangerous for 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 Messerschmitt 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 first thing we need to gain altitude 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.160
 probably even a little higher than ours 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 optimal since there is a heavy 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.840
 fighter and in general there is someone 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.160
 getting to the height of horseflies is enough 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.070
 not bad with under the afterburner 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.900
 climbs on their ceilings we need 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.000
 gain altitude as high as possible and 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.320
 look out for the first convenient target 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.570
 in the hangar I forgot to say about 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.700
 perks and therefore we will discuss it here 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.280
 Be sure to first pump the review 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.500
 gave the motor expert further a sniper and another 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.700
 with one hand you can take veterans further 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 already at your discretion 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.470
 priority was the choice of varnish 3 so 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.320
 he is one of the most dangerous 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 opponents in this situation, I sit down 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.130
 him on the tail and deciding not 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.540
 let him in any case for 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.260
 except that I myself 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.930
 somebody sat on the tail worth understanding 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.660
 that Messerschmitt is still a boom buzzer 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 and the plane that plays from the aisles but 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.570
 in this situation, exactly this behavior 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.940
 that is, the maneuver belt flag was 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.390
 correct it was he who allowed me 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.390
 to win 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.560
 the correct setup weapon allowed me 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480
 screw the log and pick it up 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.980
 and our next goal will be gadflies 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.520
 who chase our heavy 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.520
 fighter 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.740
 with the remaining enemies finished and now 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.200
 in our priority spitfire attack aircraft and 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.270
 they let them go for him in no case 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.990
 considering that the enemy has an advantage 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.990
 fighters 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.670
 on messerschmitts always watch carefully 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.620
 for using the passage engine 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.450
 cools grandfather minute absence 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.450
 afterburner can play a cruel joke with you 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.169
 the situation is so that opponents 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.419
 attacks from behind 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.919
 We are trying to kill the first who climbed into our 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.919
 a bunch and go somewhere up 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.620
 so you gave 2 turns and now gone 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.410
 up as you see us helped take off and 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.410
 the Japanese were with that i'm and we turn to 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.320
 him vertically and destroy further on 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.449
 speeds go ahead and do 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.160
 smeared barrel to panam harder 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.400
 have been hit since our ally 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.650
 is behind the opponents he will help 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.070
 us remove some fighter from 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.070
 tail 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.139
 switching targets check that 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.630
 fighters turn away from us this 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.370
 moment can be turned on them and 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.370
 enter any target 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.600
 this fight is not perfect 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.520
 indicator in the game on the misery 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.800
 in any case if you were told that 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.840
 the plane plays from the height of the aisles it is not 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.540
 Means every battle the plane must play 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.340
 just watch out for the game situation 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.180
 think over tactics here 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.180
 allow you to win 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.689
 it remains for the small destroy the pipe 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.699
 century and i will summarize messerschmitt 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.069
 did not like the car very well 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.409
 suitable for fan so bend i 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.110
 I advise everyone not to greedy word 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.879
 leave her in the hangar which i did on 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.530
 I had this all with you and queer 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.259
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.189
 be sure to comment on this video and 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.189
 good luck to you
