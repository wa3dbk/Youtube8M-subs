as<00:00:16.700> I<00:00:16.940> promised<00:00:17.390> before<00:00:17.420> in<00:00:18.050> one<00:00:18.530> of<00:00:18.680> my

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
as I promised before in one of my

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.670 
as I promised before in one of my
previous<00:00:19.310> video<00:00:19.700> that<00:00:20.500> I<00:00:21.500> will<00:00:22.460> do<00:00:22.730> an<00:00:22.910> update

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
previous video that I will do an update

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.220 
previous video that I will do an update
on<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.890> housing<00:00:25.340> of<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.730> new<00:00:26.210> generators<00:00:27.050> I

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
on the housing of the new generators I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.060 
on the housing of the new generators I
was<00:00:27.470> building<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.330> designing<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.570> building

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
was building and designing and building

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.360 
was building and designing and building
so<00:00:31.070> here's<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.460> video<00:00:31.610> about<00:00:32.270> one<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.660> them

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
so here's the video about one of them

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.790 
so here's the video about one of them
it's<00:00:34.600> almost<00:00:35.600> done<00:00:35.840> as<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.350> can<00:00:36.380> see<00:00:37.480> it's<00:00:38.480> a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
it's almost done as you can see it's a

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.680 
it's almost done as you can see it's a
MDF<00:00:39.800> housing<00:00:42.100> this<00:00:43.100> design<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:44.059> basically<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
MDF housing this design is basically the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.189 
MDF housing this design is basically the
same<00:00:44.870> as<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.200> one<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.910> yeah<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.840> design

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
same as that one it's yeah just a design

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.450 
same as that one it's yeah just a design
of<00:00:48.350> mine<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:50.929> I'm<00:00:51.140> using<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.559> because<00:00:51.890> I<00:00:52.129> like

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
of mine and I'm using it because I like

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.299 
of mine and I'm using it because I like
it<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:54.370> here<00:00:55.370> I'm<00:00:55.879> using<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.800> one<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.920> my<00:00:58.010> long

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
it and here I'm using a one of my long

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.259 
it and here I'm using a one of my long
shafts<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:59.000> have<00:00:59.210> as<00:00:59.859> you<00:01:00.859> can<00:01:01.010> see<00:01:01.249> I<00:01:01.550> have<00:01:02.030> on

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
shafts I have as you can see I have on

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.710 
shafts I have as you can see I have on
it<00:01:02.449> now<00:01:02.949> by<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.010> way<00:01:04.220> these<00:01:04.640> two<00:01:04.699> rotors<00:01:05.449> here

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
it now by the way these two rotors here

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.710 
it now by the way these two rotors here
and<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.980> basically<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.430> five<00:01:07.670> flywheel<00:01:08.480> in

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
and this is basically a five flywheel in

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.260 
and this is basically a five flywheel in
the<00:01:08.810> middle<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.580> setup<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:11.090> give

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the middle this is just a setup to give

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.530 
the middle this is just a setup to give
you<00:01:11.390> an<00:01:11.450> idea<00:01:12.490> what<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:13.790> do<00:01:13.970> with<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:14.270> shot

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
you an idea what I can do with this shot

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.980 
you an idea what I can do with this shot
of<00:01:14.570> am<00:01:15.050> i<00:01:15.260> could<00:01:15.860> put<00:01:16.040> water<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.820> two<00:01:17.480> rotors

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
of am i could put water on it two rotors

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.770 
of am i could put water on it two rotors
three<00:01:18.920> rotors<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.640> know<00:01:19.939> won't<00:01:20.390> roll<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
three rotors you know won't roll the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.450 
three rotors you know won't roll the
flywheel<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:21.740> on<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:25.040> those<00:01:25.189> of<00:01:25.250> you

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
flywheel and so on so for those of you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.450 
flywheel and so on so for those of you
asking<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.180> know<00:01:26.240> why<00:01:26.540> should<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:27.439> would<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.189> put

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
asking you know why should I would I put

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.630 
asking you know why should I would I put
the<00:01:28.579> flywheel<00:01:29.030> over<00:01:29.329> here<00:01:29.799> well<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:31.130> tested<00:01:31.579> it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the flywheel over here well I tested it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.139 
the flywheel over here well I tested it
before<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.420> if<00:01:33.020> our<00:01:33.350> only<00:01:33.560> generator<00:01:34.219> like

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
before and if our only generator like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.830 
before and if our only generator like
this<00:01:35.390> with<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.409> fly<00:01:36.710> over<00:01:37.100> here<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.729> makes<00:01:38.659> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
this with a fly over here it makes a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.920 
this with a fly over here it makes a
drive<00:01:39.079> side<00:01:39.350> more<00:01:39.770> efficient<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:40.969> I'm<00:01:41.780> not

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
drive side more efficient so I'm not

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.130 
drive side more efficient so I'm not
complaining<00:01:42.350> about<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:43.549> using<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:47.140> yeah

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
complaining about it just using it yeah

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.219 
complaining about it just using it yeah
there's<00:01:48.979> not<00:01:49.100> much<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.430> say<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:50.990> pretty

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
there's not much to say it's a pretty

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:02.160 
there's not much to say it's a pretty
pretty<00:01:51.950> heavy<00:01:52.340> wooden<00:01:53.119> setup

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.920 

all<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.280> sides<00:02:03.549> are<00:02:03.790> all<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.090> same<00:02:04.330> nice

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
all the sides are all the same nice

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.150 
all the sides are all the same nice
balance<00:02:05.439> everywhere<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.590> course<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.069> I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
balance everywhere and of course if I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.510 
balance everywhere and of course if I
gave<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.520> little<00:02:12.640> spin<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:14.370> pulled<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
gave it a little spin I pulled it a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.290 
gave it a little spin I pulled it a
little<00:02:15.849> bit<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
little bit like this as you can see it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.240 
little bit like this as you can see it
is<00:02:20.110> spinning<00:02:20.410> fairly<00:02:21.130> smoothly<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:24.100> would

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
is spinning fairly smoothly and it would

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.820 
is spinning fairly smoothly and it would
spin<00:02:24.520> for<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> pretty<00:02:25.030> long<00:02:25.180> time<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> that's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
spin for a pretty long time so that's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.300 
spin for a pretty long time so that's
always<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.160> good<00:02:27.400> thing<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.620> buildings<00:02:30.100> are<00:02:30.280> in

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
always a good thing the buildings are in

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.820 
always a good thing the buildings are in
there<00:02:30.670> somewhere

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there somewhere

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.540 
there somewhere
now<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.220> high<00:02:33.459> efficient<00:02:34.060> bearing<00:02:35.550> twelve

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
now it's a high efficient bearing twelve

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.710 
now it's a high efficient bearing twelve
poor<00:02:36.819> rotor<00:02:37.680> let<00:02:38.680> me<00:02:38.739> stop<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
poor rotor let me stop it

sonofa rotor rectangular magnets this
one<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.480> perfectly<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> same<00:02:47.470> as<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:47.920> one

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
one is perfectly the same as this one

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.860 
one is perfectly the same as this one
both<00:02:48.549> are<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.850> same<00:02:48.880> like<00:02:49.420> twins

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
both are the same like twins

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.020 
both are the same like twins
I<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.940> now<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> said<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.790> setup

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
I have now like I said it's just a setup

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.160 
I have now like I said it's just a setup
to<00:02:55.360> give<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.660> an<00:02:55.720> idea<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.840> idea<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to give you an idea so now the idea is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.590 
to give you an idea so now the idea is
to<00:02:59.350> put<00:02:59.530> to<00:03:00.190> test<00:03:00.400> some<00:03:00.640> curls<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.420> like

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
to put to test some curls in it like

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.340 
to put to test some curls in it like
this<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:04.120> North<00:03:04.299> Pole<00:03:04.510> South<00:03:04.810> Pole<00:03:04.870> or

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
this and with North Pole South Pole or

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.270 
this and with North Pole South Pole or
sulfur<00:03:05.830> sulfur<00:03:06.160> or<00:03:10.320> put<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.500> in<00:03:11.680> such<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> way

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
sulfur sulfur or put it in such a way

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.199 
sulfur sulfur or put it in such a way
that<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.390> can<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.019> these<00:03:14.260> two<00:03:14.470> rotors<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> 24

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
that I can use these two rotors as a 24

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.949 
that I can use these two rotors as a 24
power<00:03:16.390> loader<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:17.370> hope<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.959> understand

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
power loader I hope you can understand

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.310 
power loader I hope you can understand
that

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
that

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.830 
that
so<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:21.459> would<00:03:21.579> be<00:03:21.640> total<00:03:22.180> pull<00:03:22.329> on<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.600> side

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
so what would be total pull on this side

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.509 
so what would be total pull on this side
this<00:03:23.079> side<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:23.680> alternating<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.799> next

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
this side but alternating so this next

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.520 
this side but alternating so this next
over<00:03:27.730> here<00:03:27.760> should<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.079> middle<00:03:29.380> of

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
over here should be in the middle of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.120 
over here should be in the middle of
these<00:03:29.709> two<00:03:30.690> yeah<00:03:31.690> anything<00:03:32.049> think<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:32.950> get

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
these two yeah anything think you get

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.319 
these two yeah anything think you get
the<00:03:33.220> idea<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:35.220> also<00:03:36.220> test<00:03:36.430> these<00:03:36.579> coils<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
the idea and also test these coils and

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.780 
the idea and also test these coils and
of<00:03:37.900> course<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.320> gap<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.680> much<00:03:39.070> bigger<00:03:39.370> but

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
of course the gap is not much bigger but

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.970 
of course the gap is not much bigger but
that<00:03:39.910> doesn't<00:03:40.239> matter<00:03:40.329> because<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.859> can

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that doesn't matter because as you can

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.150 
that doesn't matter because as you can
see<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.190> have<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> lot<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.670> spacer<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.359> there<00:03:43.390> I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
see I have a lot of spacer in there I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.430 
see I have a lot of spacer in there I
feel<00:03:45.160> also<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.819> lot<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.150> those<00:03:46.299> pacer<00:03:46.600> which<00:03:47.260> I

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
feel also a lot of those pacer which I

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.250 
feel also a lot of those pacer which I
made<00:03:47.819> all<00:03:49.680> aluminum<00:03:50.680> spacers<00:03:52.079> also<00:03:53.079> these

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
made all aluminum spacers also these

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.660 
made all aluminum spacers also these
types<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:55.269> both<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.450> these<00:03:55.750> types<00:03:56.670> all

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
types I have both of these types all

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.509 
types I have both of these types all
kinds<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> spacers<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:59.799> there<00:03:59.859> there's

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
kinds of the spacers in there there's

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.400 
kinds of the spacers in there there's
something<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.090> little<00:04:01.569> bit<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> gold<00:04:01.989> but

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
something like a little bit of gold but

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.309 
something like a little bit of gold but
it's<00:04:02.590> not<00:04:02.709> gold<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.160> just<00:04:03.370> grass<00:04:04.769> space<00:04:05.769> also

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
it's not gold it's just grass space also

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.920 
it's not gold it's just grass space also
so<00:04:08.319> for<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> coil<00:04:08.859> as<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.549> will<00:04:10.209> adjust<00:04:10.599> the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
so for a coil as this I will adjust the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.830 
so for a coil as this I will adjust the
gap<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.530> maybe<00:04:12.489> also<00:04:12.760> remove<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.629> flywheel

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
gap and maybe also remove the flywheel

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.180 
gap and maybe also remove the flywheel
depends

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
depends

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.220 
depends
