00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.440
 hello, we send greetings to all 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.970
 who see us in different countries of 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 Spanish language 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.240
 why 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.700
 but we send greetings to all 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.150
 who see us who speak Spanish today 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:26.950
 We decided to make a video to show you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.140
 the new world shark 2012 good I want 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.340
 start this video telling them that this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.830
 is for me the best table because it is very 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.220
 versatile can serve for downhill 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.610
 freeride slide and what they want 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.270
 it's practically good for puig but a 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.720
 little because as you can see this more like this 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.060
 that is a little more tired but like 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.870
 it is very useful now because it is good for 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.420
 downhill has a bit of with kate w what 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.360
 that makes your feet firm and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.180
 so do not move 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.950
 have good stability at the same time 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 that she sees herself and China for 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 slide is good because the way it has 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 it's rocker although it has these that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.229
 they call the pears that are the ones that do 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 that when one does the slide the foot does not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 it slips so you get more 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.410
 stability and because your skin does not slip 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.619
 so easily also has several 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.540
 options to accommodate strokes like this 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.940
 that if you prefer them a little more together 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.150
 or if you want your feet to go over 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.890
 the whole trunk behind the trump equal 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.200
 you can do it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.510
 if you put your trick like here you can 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 see a little later 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.830
 you can use up a bit of it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 to hatred or something else 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.220
 interesting is that the table was cut 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.290
 with a cnc lathe for wood and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.730
 they could do these that are called uy 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.310
 two eggs so 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.970
 you have no problem when doing 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.280
 a 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.220
 maybe a very close turn or a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 slide because then the tires then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.160
 do not hit him with the board what he does not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.790
 it produces you huelva already from a brief 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.850

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.550
