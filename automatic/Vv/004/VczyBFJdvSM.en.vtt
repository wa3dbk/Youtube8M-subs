 professional adult 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 it's a bit of a second chance for 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 young dropouts since these 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 have dropped school and they have like a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 second chance to continue their 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.450
 studies and to graduate a diploma I 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.820
 always wanted to be an educator 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.620
 specialized does that by seeing my 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.450
 boy grows up at the same time they go 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.380
 start school soon I thought 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 why not it's like the time of 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 answer for the same and return to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.730
 school than to finish my second da for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 appreciate also I have no event 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.590
 like a cup city hall is this important 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 since they rightly emphasize their 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.290
 perseverance them here are working to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 the year with this theme and it's 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.330
 individualized personal education that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.050
 deserves to be 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.300
 stressed like that ccc it's hard to do 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.840
 a return to school just for a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.830
 young dropout it's important to say 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.830
 congratulate them 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940
 that's what this is the first time 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.000
 I was a little shocked because 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.680
 that in the background every day a team 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 encourages an argument is listed in soup 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.510
 the efforts that I'm doing my homework that 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.270
 for a day and that sleeps formula 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.740
 he calls mono it's in front of everyone 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.410
 it's to show kind that I have 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.080
 makes up efforts but that and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.400
 have noticed mine since this is the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.880
 director in addition what gave me my 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.890
 hammer 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.230
 he was proud to give me merit to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.600
 samoa as data people a little more what 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.390
 kind of trust and have the taste of 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.390
 more continued north monchy denmark a 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.490
 surely they actually do it to encourage 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.000
 young people the green and the white associated 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.190
 together in unison to help party 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.310
 to emphasize perseverance then 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.720
 finally motivated the fast 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.490
 I think it's important to emphasize 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.260
 school perseverance because it gives 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.490
 the will to continue to the world that's their 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.770
 shows that in the background they come 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.240
 more for nothing because there is someone 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.620
 who is who who see their efforts 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.140
 it really is the end of all that is 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.830
 as much the young person who decides to pursue 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.340
 his studies 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.560
 the parent in a family environment who 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.960
 encourages young people to persevere in 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.900
 every day it's also the taught 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.210
 the teacher who mentor the student and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.250
 which ultimately makes the studies more 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.400
 interesting is ultimately 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.020
 the employer who will hire these 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.150
 fucking resources there are slaughtered this 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.140
 work we want the whole population 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.480
 encourages our young madelinots to 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.050
 continue their education and landed a 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.570
 diploma 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.570
