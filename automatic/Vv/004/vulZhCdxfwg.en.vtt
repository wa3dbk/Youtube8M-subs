really good ability for this deck
individually<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.649> starter<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:38.059> then<00:00:38.449> the

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
individually so starter and then the

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:48.610 
individually so starter and then the
trigger<00:00:38.899> lineups<00:00:39.379> i<00:00:39.590> bowl<00:00:46.059> yes<00:00:47.059> hatreds<00:00:47.870> uh<00:00:48.140> I

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
trigger lineups i bowl yes hatreds uh I

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.580 
trigger lineups i bowl yes hatreds uh I
was<00:00:49.399> going<00:00:49.670> with<00:00:49.789> 12<00:00:50.120> crits<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:50.719> it<00:00:50.989> seems<00:00:51.289> it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
was going with 12 crits but it seems it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.819 
was going with 12 crits but it seems it
needs<00:00:51.829> some<00:00:52.219> draw<00:00:52.460> power<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.000> i<00:00:53.059> added<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.829> four

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
needs some draw power so i added in four

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.279 
needs some draw power so i added in four
drawers<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:55.940> i<00:00:55.969> can<00:00:56.210> get<00:00:56.359> hands<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.140> of

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
drawers so i can get hands and then of

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.189 
drawers so i can get hands and then of
course<00:00:57.320> for<00:00:57.980> heroes<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.660> that's<00:00:59.839> pretty

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
course for heroes so that's pretty

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.370 
course for heroes so that's pretty
standard<00:01:00.559> i<00:01:00.949> guess<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:02.140> 844<00:01:03.790> then<00:01:05.380> another

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
standard i guess it's a 844 then another

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.830 
standard i guess it's a 844 then another
few<00:01:06.920> zeros<00:01:07.400> i<00:01:07.550> have<00:01:07.760> i<00:01:08.480> added<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.830> chappys

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
few zeros i have i added in to chappys

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080 
few zeros i have i added in to chappys
chappies<00:01:11.840> or<00:01:12.190> actually<00:01:13.190> really<00:01:13.520> create<00:01:13.880> into

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
chappies or actually really create into

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.810 
chappies or actually really create into
that<00:01:14.270> because<00:01:14.510> i<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.530> use<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.710> mask<00:01:15.980> guard<00:01:16.280> plus

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
that because i can use a mask guard plus

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.490 
that because i can use a mask guard plus
i<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.300> get<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.450> card<00:01:17.750> i<00:01:17.840> want<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.260> drop<00:01:18.470> zone

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
i can get a card i want in the drop zone

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.110 
i can get a card i want in the drop zone
