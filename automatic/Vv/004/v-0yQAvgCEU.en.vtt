came<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> idea<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.720> using<00:02:23.960> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
came up with the idea of using a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.740 
came up with the idea of using a
character<00:02:24.590> I'd<00:02:24.710> used<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.100> previous<00:02:25.400> video

character I'd used in a previous video
to<00:02:26.750> see<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.260> people<00:02:27.590> thought<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.100> was

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
to see if people thought that it was

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.620 
to see if people thought that it was
real<00:02:28.430> or<00:02:28.610> not<00:02:28.640> even<00:02:29.030> though<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.210> was<00:02:29.360> quite

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630
