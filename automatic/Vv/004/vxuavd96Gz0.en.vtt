00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.950
 in may 2014 my book is finally over 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.920
 the attitude of technical edge many 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.809
 toads it him wonders determines the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.730
 one or the other why do I have that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:24.600
 made that already gives up so many 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:26.400
 the market because I'm over all with this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.599
 I just found both books 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.320
 Of course, but also like the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.020
 natural attitude newcomer and give that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 this book again because I have myself 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.469
 started 18 years ago even if it was 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.239
 Turtles at that time were many 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.190
 years later I'm up 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.050
 vegetable risen and so I 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.489
 my attitude changed over and over 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 and had to drive again and again 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 this should be the giveaway what 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.559
 I need everything why do I need one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 heat lamp can turtles 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 actually fast should grow so 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 I had a lot of typical questions 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.610
 then and now Serbian 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 then do not speak to contacts 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 I got the newcomers exactly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.630
 asked the question as I did then 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.150
 always has it and I want that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 in the most understandable 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 in terms of holders explain what 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.159
 you need it above why you need it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.220
 why not petting them between them 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.439
 Need kindred though the only one 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.729
 're after why can forward to you 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.560
 renounce winter restraint 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.020
 why do not you eat tomatoes or 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.250
 they should not ask quite classical 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 then there is the topic of species protection 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 the turtles are reporting and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.869
 Duty of proof that means they have to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.300
 have the yellow certificates 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.070
 and at the appropriate authority the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.530
 responsible for the respective state 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 is to be reported so that the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.780
 can assign ships under the papers 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.180
 Must be regularly on such paper 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 photographs and this paper is in 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.780
 this profession at 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.790
 then I have one in the very back 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.470
 address list with the whole belong to it 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.790
 you know which one is actually heard 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 responsible to whom do I have to turn 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.170
 I have you to the question if 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.540
 turtles actually for children 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.080
 are suitable or not on the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.410
 I have long explained this topic 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.180
 old when i have my reasons in the meantime 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.750
 I am the mother of two children and myself 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.120
 therefore know the differences of children 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 to send 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.260
 and I try as much as possible 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.660
 understandably not express that way 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.550
 this typical schwafel therefore the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.630
 second son occurs but the whole 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.090
 normal actually uses so as 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.680
 many pictures are in there when many say 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.900
 so can not more than 1000 words 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.650
 Of course you can do it with his attitude 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.300
 implement pictures to see yes where can 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:33.870
 of course you get that good right 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:36.780
 to offer a place to look forward to online trade 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.290
 Of course , I should get something for you 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.790
 not be happy like about you and 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.790
 then react accordingly 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.489
 I'm happy when I'm up there 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.489
 the attitude can bring closer 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.390
 that was forever
