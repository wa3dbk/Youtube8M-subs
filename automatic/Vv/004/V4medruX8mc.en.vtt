00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
literally tells you every single thing
you<00:01:41.909> need<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> player<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you need to know about that player on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
you need to know about that player on
the<00:01:43.259> market<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> moment<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.759> really

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the market at the moment and it's really

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.600 
the market at the moment and it's really
really<00:01:45.270> good<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> moment<00:01:46.159> but<00:01:47.159> i'd

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
really good at the moment but i'd

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.219 
really good at the moment but i'd
recommend<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.420> keep<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.750> trying<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
recommend just keep on trying because a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
recommend just keep on trying because a
lot<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> people<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.770> buying<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.460> bidding<00:01:50.700> next

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lot of people are buying or bidding next

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
lot of people are buying or bidding next
to<00:01:51.149> their<00:01:51.299> by<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> player<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> make

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to their by now of the player and make

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.440 
to their by now of the player and make
sure<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.030> console

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
sure you actually on the right console

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
sure you actually on the right console
because<00:01:54.540> sometimes<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> accidentally

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
because sometimes you can accidentally

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
because sometimes you can accidentally
be<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> wrong<00:01:56.850> console<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> loss

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
be on the wrong console and make a loss

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
be on the wrong console and make a loss
so<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.369> i<00:01:59.399> found<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.850> when<00:01:59.909> i<00:02:00.030> first

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
so that is what i found out when i first

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
so that is what i found out when i first
started<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.750> method<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.979> Gibbs

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
started in this method but if this Gibbs

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
started in this method but if this Gibbs
if<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.850> went<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.119> check<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> skips<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> would

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
if we went and check the skips it would

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
if we went and check the skips it would
take<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.439> too<00:02:04.469> long<00:02:04.649> doing<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.939> if

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
take way too long doing this because if

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
take way too long doing this because if
I<00:02:06.450> by<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> time<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.899> probably<00:02:07.259> type<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.489> of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I by the time I probably type in all of

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.390 
I by the time I probably type in all of
this<00:02:09.060> he<00:02:09.330> would<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.750> expired<00:02:10.259> by<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.590> but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
this he would have expired by now but

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100 
this he would have expired by now but
the<00:02:11.610> easy<00:02:11.879> thing<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.840> have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the easy thing with this is you can have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.470 
the easy thing with this is you can have
the<00:02:13.140> players<00:02:13.350> still<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.920> tab<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.450> can

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the players still on a tab and you can

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
the players still on a tab and you can
just<00:02:15.870> keep<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.320> there<00:02:16.500> plus<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.580> takes<00:02:17.610> two

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
just keep it there plus it takes two

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.700 
just keep it there plus it takes two
seconds<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.540> literally<00:02:19.080> write<00:02:19.230> their<00:02:19.380> name<00:02:19.530> in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
seconds to literally write their name in

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040 
seconds to literally write their name in
and<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.610> automatically<00:02:21.420> comes<00:02:21.630> up<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:21.960> their

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and it automatically comes up with their

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.600 
and it automatically comes up with their
cheapest<00:02:22.440> by<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.490> really

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
cheapest by now so that's really really

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.400 
cheapest by now so that's really really
good<00:02:23.670> that's<00:02:24.390> literally<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> trading<00:02:25.260> tip

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
good that's literally the trading tip
