00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 what to do if you flew 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:21.689
 boot area and not loading 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:24.539
 windows turn on the computer means this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.960
 a way not only exists and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.410
 several ways but for me he is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410
 convenient 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.660
 now 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:52.300
 here we see that loading windows is not 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.739
 going on I have an operating 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.089
 windows 8 system 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:11.610
 and he will be here as if windows xp is not 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:21.840
 well, let's start recovering 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 the procedure is very simple any beginner 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.569
 we need to boot from the flash drive now 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.840
 load any pension system 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.030
 So 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:26.799
 go to our flash drive and there is a folder 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.799
 I like, and carpets 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:39.750
 I myself created here the file will be sects and where 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.209
 This file is in any distribution 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 windows vista minus seven minus 8 into folders 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.280
 boot 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.079
 here you just copy it well there even 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.510
 not necessarily copy really 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.609
 but I did as I like again. 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.049
 I repeat 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:06.419
 here are 2 batch files 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:10.840
 means one to restore windows 7 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:12.730
 the version is well there, that is, windows vista 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 windows 7 windows 8 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.680
 no matter what bitness here 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:26.620
 the expert is there 2000 on the expert 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.689
 2003 server here we go further means you I 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.060
 I know that I have an operating system there 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.419
 windows 8 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.229
 it means that you do not need to run this file 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:44.129
 us inside the file inside the file we have 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.129
 just registered key 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:53.170
 then mt 60 and specify the drive c 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.110
 optionally specify drive c 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.580
 that is, we have a logical disk 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.310
 Here is the boot area with us 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.220
 located on a physical disk you can 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.560
 specify any logical drive 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.670
 physical disk let's say that is 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.610
 let's say you have 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.460
 physical disk of the hotel on you not section c 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:26.480
 holes you can specify here and c and d 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:31.060
 ete doesn't matter about xp all either 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:36.710
 just the key is n 352 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.120
 but all run the boot file 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.120
 the area has recovered 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.259
 here we see that -8 we are loading 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.699
 I want to add more about the file 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:36.650
 boots 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:40.340
 here are the sects where if you are going to him 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:46.520
 run in 32-bit environment then you need 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:49.219
 the file is also from windows and 32-bit then 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.490
 there is if you take the distribution 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:55.939
 windows 7 let's say x64 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.330
 and this file will try there somewhere 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.250
 your ultimate 32-bit operating systems 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:09.250
 run it then naturally we donâ€™t 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:09.250
 will start and restore it 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:18.250
 Naturally any bit that is 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:26.089
 here we have booted windows 8 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:29.199
 now show them the windows 8 64 cauldrons 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.199
 that is, look 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:47.360
 windows 8 64 bit well that's all 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.030
 Thank you all for your attention.
