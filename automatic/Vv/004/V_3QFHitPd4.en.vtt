00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.639
 hi it's chavin we end up 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.619
 today for a new video of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.359
 side of the leanback quads then we 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.949
 were gone to hunt trolls and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.480
 Oh surprise what is found in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.980
 the bloomberg forest basically 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 cats do then you are definitely 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 already asked the question of amakna side 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.560
 also when we see a disappointment that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.000
 are on the mountain base of the gracques 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 time is near the village 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 of amakna it is the apparitions of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.670
 monsters are related to invasions 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 ordered by chefs 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 so today in vibert boxes 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 which we will go to look at a little bit 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 what happens on the side of cats do 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 and their leader actually so believed the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.989
 scrap cat who is so the chief of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.700
 business that invades the woods and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.050
 we're fine just the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.059
 fight so you see it's a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 monster that is pretty solid since 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.500
 go to him but the point of life he has 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 a lot of action points and he has all 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 the aided spells will be so in fact it's 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.519
 a super g who is going to be able to have 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.920
 invisibility make invisibility to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.570
 his allies and especially who's going to have a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 deadly attack that will do pretty bad 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.930
 and so we find it in the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 wood we will fight him 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.820
 jennifer of Ysaline arc and myself you 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.350
 see it is accompanied by 3rd taste and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 so I'm going to show you a little bit 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 in combat what it gives this super this 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.380
 super gives up knowing that this is neither 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 an arch-monster but a dungeon ace 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 really it's a monster without freedom 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.579
 nice no and we'll have to fight him 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.140
 to be able to release free the fingers 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.880
 so all these parts you see a the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.960
 first breakthrough start dreaming a 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 invisible master a friend to him and then 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.020
 helped him he'll go get put 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.450
 discreetly next to someone and him 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.799
 throw a good deadly attack that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.930
 hurts a lot and there they were for 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.280
 to say that they may be but that's fine 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.259
 still very bad so the strategy 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 what we will adopt in this fight is 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 obviously to clear the menus first 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.719
 since it is always more obvious 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.280
 fight a monster a little solid 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.459
 when there is more to dress 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.620
 and so it's gone I'll do when 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.410
 even a little cut in this fight 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.090
 since in real time I already took a 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.510
 a quarter of an hour to beat this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.400
 group 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 so as I speak to videos 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 troubles you know I'm going I'm going 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.459
 do a little trick I'll just leave you 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.860
 already watch the start of the fight 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.290
 you see craftswomen too she has 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.200
 felt his invisibility could for 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 to be quiet and we will continue 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.830
 to do damage 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.930
 all three on the jewels that are 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 that are visible then that one there is 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.730
 quickly finished but still have to find 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 whoever is a vest and finish the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.410
 third so suddenly as I the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.260
 say it's still a little good then 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.050
 to get back to it raw in itself 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.880
 a tram that is pretty balÃ¨ze like that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.069
 of this crime a cat do but that's 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.989
 still a tram in his game mode 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.110
 and you're going to do it badly enough 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.310
 looked at this project but hey I 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.870
 am I going to take a nice attack 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.060
 deadly and lilac are right now 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.980
 here he is 16 will pay so he does when 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.400
 even very very badly on it we will do 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 the cup 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.070
 and then we will go back to the increased hunting 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.260
 but then we got to get him 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.790
 on the corner of the map does it all 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.530
 simply omitted traps 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.209
 which will enable us to identify 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.970
 an idea based on the pitfalls they 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.760
 do not count throat and corner but 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.860
 others no but anyway you 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.510
 go see it's almost effectively 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.400
 obviously there is a small fail a pseudo 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.070
 you know I'm still doing a lot of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.690
 fail in the fighting but hey there by 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.070
 example I expose myself to a superb 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.239
 attack the fed then it's kas who goes 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.980
 happen to me but yet I will be 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.670
 technically bring it so it was 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.410
 not it was not the best placement 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.270
 but hey it's okay I 'll go pussy 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.470
 so everything is fine and first of all that test 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.560
 so we see very well where lived what 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.620
 allows gdf rd damage even when the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.780
 runner either be invisible rabeni there 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.280
 as I told you at the very beginning 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.989
 a lot of life points so it's this 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.630
 which explains that the fight is enough 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.930
 long to say they go to us his side 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.410
 will continue to trap for good 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.360
 identify where the floods are in gold 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.320
 So I found it was still 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.010
 yesterday that good rather rather not bad so 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.479
 it helps to visualize where he is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.979
 except that as you can imagine, we're going 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.380
 lose it at some point since 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.870
 does not have the opportunity place and no longer 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.700
 50 trap one turn so suddenly we have a 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.139
 moment and well we do not see anymore we see 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.139
 where he went but we do not see where 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.300
 it is it's run so to try to 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.870
 note the area on which he will be able to 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.620
 to hide from my side I'm going badly stuck 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.120
 in fact you have already tried to do 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.000
 some damage and then I'm stuck 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.250
 with a tree to prevent isabelle the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.419
 little hole to make sure they pass 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.460
 on the other side it will always make you 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.950
 used rpm and it's suddenly online and 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.660
 will do the area and I see hiding 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.520
 so where he has a little pain when you 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.200
 fall on a trap but it does not matter 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.539
 he still holds and that at least 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.550
 the advantage that the hollow gold we know 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.640
 know where he's going to go through 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.340
 the south is so a number of pm that he 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.660
 will not be too far from 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.160
 we can see with a bit of 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.580
 chance to continue to be able to make him 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.850
 damage 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.740
 obviously a good villa tones 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.780
 hot all the traps but then for 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.940
 to know exactly what to think 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.729
 go there at all while launching my descent 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.990
 or at random and by moving 15 by 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.140
 box to try to find it 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.180
 so stop there his researches 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.220
 so for those who have already fought the 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.560
 pki in his dungeon they are used to 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.450
 hit it blindly like that we'll have 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.620
 did not there long ago pki 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.350
 it was painful enough 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.900
 it's always difficult to go to 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.669
 riddle to find the monster but 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.060
 good it's part of the charm to play 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.210
 so 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.040
 so here we will continue to look for it 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.639
 there is art that will try to 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.130
 get closer to her by doing doing 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.540
 on the 110m hurdles is called tonight but 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:10.600
 finally this one aged impossible to the 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.740
 find and after we went a little 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.280
 lucky to know 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.590
 here you bet 15 markaz and hop 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.400
 in this place we can not it is so 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.010
 to win he's legitimate and to type him 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.360
 so I 'm fine I'm fine under the 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.800
 hand of the stones me I will indicate 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.870
 to water for all can better finished 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.430
 knowing that there he does not stay 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.630
 great thing the everest is about 300 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.330
 points of life and so we'll get to 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.039
 shareholders a priori to the next finally 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.990
 in this round there that changes are going 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.240
 get to the end so it's going to be three years 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.680
 rather easy so here it was well 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:50.590
 there to make up for those names she has 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.300
 arrived on the form and had some 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.510
 deadly Senate attacks in the dishes 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.660
 which are spread on my invoque april 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.760
 is filmed 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.380
 the week these deadly attacks to 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.930
 sugar had to a small payet for 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.960
 define 301 points become it's over 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.750
 we fought so records you see 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.700
 good xp side it does not pay however 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.920
 masses but that's still it 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.570
 taken on the drops it's going to be mostly 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.390
 that she drop us who are going to be 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.910
 interesting we 'll have after the rest is going 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:28.410
 are deceiving themselves expensive do it so it's not 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.790
 because not so great that's the same 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.070
 time if we do that it's not yours for 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.080
 xp or no time to deceive no 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.880
 more but really be able to release the 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.070
 breitling berck knowing that like you 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.230
 see there remains the shafer that remains 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.360
 present on the maps but years but 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.880
 when they will be fought and defeated 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.740
 well, it will allow them to pop 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.300
 usual population of the woods to know 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:53.640
 vary the trolls and the dead on this
