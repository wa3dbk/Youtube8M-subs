00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the fact that the Slavs were drunkards is a myth 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.830
 it is scientifically proven 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.059
 for example the words vodka appeared quite 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 Recently vodka called herbal infusions 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.670
 on the water and they were taken as healing 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.510
 drinks on what we call tea then 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.750
 word time tea was called broth 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.619
 but when came 1 merchants to sell 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.710
 Alcohol on Russia they long thought and as 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.110
 name hard liquor and someone 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.059
 God knows who came to mind is probably 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.969
 some fields were the first to arrive 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.950
 trader from Poland, I think that they were not 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 indigenous Poles and they told from u 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 Slavs are such a modern language 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.469
 brand words in the boat are healing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.930
 the drinks 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 let 's call here to him at home that healing and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.440
 so when the Slavs began to drink this one 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 new boat 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.930
 they became suckers utter and so 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.040
 many myths remain 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 invented by the Slavs and this is one of the first 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.710
 our family is very destructive to us 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.530
 towards enemies but the bell tower in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.320
