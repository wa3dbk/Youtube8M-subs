00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
dummy up to 100 yards so again it uses

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.219 
dummy up to 100 yards so again it uses
22<00:01:52.729> caliber<00:01:52.999> blanks<00:01:53.450> use<00:01:53.749> the<00:01:53.840> ones<00:01:54.020> they

the<00:05:25.370> angle<00:05:25.460> lowered<00:05:26.030> angle<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.690> launcher<00:05:27.020> a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the angle lowered angle the launcher a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.930 
the angle lowered angle the launcher a
little<00:05:27.290> bit<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.590> went<00:05:27.740> about<00:05:27.860> 85<00:05:28.370> but<00:05:28.730> I

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
little bit and it went about 85 but I

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.760 
little bit and it went about 85 but I
can<00:05:29.300> definitely<00:05:29.390> see<00:05:29.660> if<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.320> don't<00:05:30.440> have<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
can definitely see if you don't have the

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.980 
can definitely see if you don't have the
wind<00:05:30.980> today<00:05:31.600> conditions<00:05:32.600> all<00:05:32.750> right<00:05:32.870> you

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
wind today conditions all right you

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.560 
wind today conditions all right you
could<00:05:33.110> you<00:05:33.410> could<00:05:33.560> probably<00:05:33.770> get<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:35.300> dummies

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
could you could probably get the dummies

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.760 
could you could probably get the dummies
out<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.810> 100<00:05:36.110> yards<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.530> may<00:05:36.620> be<00:05:36.650> wondering

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
out to 100 yards so you may be wondering

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.070 
out to 100 yards so you may be wondering
why<00:05:37.190> is<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:37.970> an<00:05:38.210> advantage<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.690> shooting

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
why is that an advantage to shooting

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.420 
why is that an advantage to shooting
that<00:05:39.290> far<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:39.710> what<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.950> can<00:05:40.070> do<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.250> change

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
that far but what you can do is change

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.220 
that far but what you can do is change
your<00:05:40.550> situations<00:05:41.180> up<00:05:41.390> if<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.780> need<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:41.960> shoot

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
your situations up if you need to shoot

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.530 
your situations up if you need to shoot
maybe<00:05:42.530> from<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:43.490> know<00:05:43.580> across<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.150> lake<00:05:44.330> or

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
maybe from you know across the lake or

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.030 
maybe from you know across the lake or
Creek<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.990> have<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.170> dummy<00:05:45.440> coming<00:05:45.710> at<00:05:45.830> you

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
Creek and have the dummy coming at you

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.680 
Creek and have the dummy coming at you
can<00:05:46.160> change<00:05:46.400> different<00:05:46.510> scenario<00:05:47.510> so

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
can change different scenario so

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.780 
can change different scenario so
depending<00:05:48.050> on<00:05:48.170> your<00:05:48.320> load<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.560> dummy<00:05:48.950> size<00:05:49.220> it

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
depending on your load and dummy size it

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.480 
depending on your load and dummy size it
will<00:05:49.940> change<00:05:50.270> how<00:05:50.720> far<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.530> dummy<00:05:51.770> goes<00:05:54.490> now

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
will change how far the dummy goes now

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.340 
will change how far the dummy goes now

so overall the mud hut blind pretty
blind<00:06:25.160> very<00:06:26.000> easy<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.360> set<00:06:26.570> up<00:06:26.600> just<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.260> little

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
blind very easy to set up just a little

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.930 
blind very easy to set up just a little
bit<00:06:27.800> higher<00:06:27.920> profile<00:06:28.370> so<00:06:28.640> maybe<00:06:28.880> just

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
bit higher profile so maybe just

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.780 
bit higher profile so maybe just
something<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.300> consider<00:06:29.390> when
