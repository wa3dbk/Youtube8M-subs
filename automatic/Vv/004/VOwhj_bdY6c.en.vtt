here's<00:00:01.170> another<00:00:01.410> quick<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.070> that<00:00:02.820> will

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
here's another quick video that will

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.740 
here's another quick video that will
provide<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.549> another<00:00:05.549> problem<00:00:06.000> you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
provide you with another problem you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.339 
provide you with another problem you
will<00:00:06.899> face<00:00:07.230> as<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.069> consumer<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:08.990> is<00:00:09.990> what

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
will face as a consumer and that is what

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.640 
will face as a consumer and that is what
does<00:00:10.620> bad<00:00:10.980> cement<00:00:11.700> actually<00:00:12.389> look<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.750> well

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
does bad cement actually look like well

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
does bad cement actually look like well
it<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.070> start<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.549> clump<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.360> won't<00:00:15.540> be<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
it will start to clump up it won't be a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.040 
it will start to clump up it won't be a
powder<00:00:16.850> anymore<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.210> will<00:00:18.359> actually<00:00:18.750> start

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
powder anymore you will actually start

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
powder anymore you will actually start
to<00:00:19.199> see<00:00:19.230> large<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.400> looks<00:00:20.609> appears<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to see large what looks appears to be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.029 
to see large what looks appears to be
rocks<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> these<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:22.830> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
rocks you know some of these things are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.670 
rocks you know some of these things are
difficult<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> break<00:00:24.050> depending<00:00:25.050> upon<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
difficult to break depending upon the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580 
difficult to break depending upon the
cement<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.490> mean<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.449> course<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> hard<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
cement I mean of course this is hard to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.910 
cement I mean of course this is hard to
find<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:30.390> hard<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> notice<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.710> you're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
find it's hard to notice when you're

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
find it's hard to notice when you're
purchasing<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> product<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.809> know

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
purchasing the product you know

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.910 
purchasing the product you know
sometimes<00:00:34.320> you're<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.649> able<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
sometimes you're going to be able to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
sometimes you're going to be able to
feel<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> bag<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.940> feel<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
feel the bag and feel some of the you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
feel the bag and feel some of the you
know<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.680> hard<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.879> most<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.270> time

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
know it's hard or not but most of time

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
know it's hard or not but most of time
it's<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.899> hard<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.280> figure<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.460> because

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it's gonna be hard to figure out because

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.680 
it's gonna be hard to figure out because
it's<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.329> densely<00:00:43.050> packed<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.129> begin<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.760> but

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's so densely packed to begin with but

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's so densely packed to begin with but
the<00:00:46.410> cements<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:47.070> need<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> powder<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the cements gonna need to be a powder a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.130 
the cements gonna need to be a powder a
powder<00:00:49.020> form<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.270> any<00:00:51.510> clumps

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
powder form it will not have any clumps

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
powder form it will not have any clumps
in<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> say<00:00:53.910> clumps<00:00:54.449> even<00:00:54.750> what

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
in it and when I say clumps even what

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
in it and when I say clumps even what
you're<00:00:55.110> looking<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:56.120> isn't<00:00:57.120> good<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you're looking at here isn't good it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.849 
you're looking at here isn't good it's
got<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.680> smooth<00:00:59.160> powder<00:00:59.520> or<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
got to be a smooth powder or it would be

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.320 
got to be a smooth powder or it would be
the<00:01:02.430> consistency<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> flour<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:05.040> example<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the consistency of flour for example you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
the consistency of flour for example you
know<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.590> something<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
know it would look something like that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.440 
know it would look something like that
wouldn't<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.600> any<00:01:09.869> lumps<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:11.189> any<00:01:11.970> anything

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
wouldn't have any lumps any any anything

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
wouldn't have any lumps any any anything
that<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.990> larger<00:01:13.409> than<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> pebble<00:01:14.159> let's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that would be larger than a pebble let's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.870 
that would be larger than a pebble let's
just<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.950> maybe<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.159> quarter<00:01:17.460> inch<00:01:17.700> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
just say maybe a quarter inch in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 
just say maybe a quarter inch in
diameter<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:19.140> create<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
diameter that that could create a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
diameter that that could create a
problem<00:01:20.180> now<00:01:21.180> here's<00:01:21.509> what<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> will<00:01:21.960> look

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
problem now here's what it will look

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.289 
problem now here's what it will look
like<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> wheelbarrow<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:24.000> you're

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
like in the wheelbarrow which you're

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
like in the wheelbarrow which you're
probably<00:01:24.509> thinking<00:01:24.750> hey<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.200> looks<00:01:25.530> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably thinking hey it just looks like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
probably thinking hey it just looks like
another<00:01:26.009> rock<00:01:26.400> well<00:01:26.939> realistically<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:28.049> could

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
another rock well realistically it could

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.300 
another rock well realistically it could
be<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> mix<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> mixed<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
be this is actually a mix that I mixed I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
be this is actually a mix that I mixed I
didn't<00:01:32.579> take<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> cement<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.869> don't

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
didn't take this cement back I don't

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.130 
didn't take this cement back I don't
think<00:01:34.350> I've<00:01:34.500> ever<00:01:34.530> taken<00:01:35.009> any<00:01:35.340> cement<00:01:35.759> back

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
think I've ever taken any cement back

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
think I've ever taken any cement back
I've<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.350> mixed<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.640> most<00:01:38.880> people

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I've just mixed it in like most people

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
I've just mixed it in like most people
do<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.780> imagine<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.850> doing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
do I would imagine but if you're doing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.429 
do I would imagine but if you're doing
something<00:01:42.649> structural<00:01:43.850> then<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
something structural then you know like

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
something structural then you know like
a<00:01:46.470> concrete<00:01:46.890> footing<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.759> something<00:01:48.180> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
a concrete footing or something like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.069 
a concrete footing or something like
that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
that
then<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.799> might<00:01:50.009> want<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.369> think<00:01:50.549> twice<00:01:50.670> about

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
then you might want to think twice about

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.139 
then you might want to think twice about
it<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.509> some<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.840> information<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it get some more information on how this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.109 
it get some more information on how this
is<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.689> affect<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.740> finished<00:01:56.280> product

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is going to affect the finished product

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
is going to affect the finished product
I<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:57.840> mixing<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.710> concrete<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I was actually mixing this concrete to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.810 
I was actually mixing this concrete to
fill<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.420> containers<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.579> going

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
fill in two containers that I was going

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690 
fill in two containers that I was going
to<00:02:02.909> use<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> support<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.170> an<00:02:04.649> aluminum<00:02:05.159> awning

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to use to support a an aluminum awning

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
to use to support a an aluminum awning
so<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> wasn't<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.350> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so as it was it wasn't really going to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.419 
so as it was it wasn't really going to
be<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> big<00:02:07.829> deal

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
be a big deal

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.330 
be a big deal
but<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.470> main<00:02:10.619> again<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> main

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
but you know the main again the main

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.440 
but you know the main again the main
point<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> video

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
point of the video

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.000 
point of the video
to<00:02:12.720> provide<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.410> structural

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to provide you with structural

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.000 
to provide you with structural
information<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.879> just<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> provide<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.690> with

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
information is just to provide you with

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.830 
information is just to provide you with
what<00:02:17.010> bad<00:02:17.250> cement<00:02:17.730> looks<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.599> gets

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
what bad cement looks like and it gets

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.530 
what bad cement looks like and it gets
this<00:02:19.050> way<00:02:19.319> as<00:02:19.590> moisture<00:02:20.010> absorbs<00:02:20.760> into<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
this way as moisture absorbs into the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.690 
this way as moisture absorbs into the
bag<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.200> more<00:02:22.379> moisture<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.980> absorbs<00:02:23.430> into

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
bag the more moisture that absorbs into

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.900 
bag the more moisture that absorbs into
these<00:02:24.470> water-resistant<00:02:25.470> not<00:02:25.980> waterproof

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
these water-resistant not waterproof

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660 
these water-resistant not waterproof
bags<00:02:27.620> eventually<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:28.800> will<00:02:28.950> start<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> lump

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
bags eventually they will start to lump

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.440 
bags eventually they will start to lump
up<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.330> older<00:02:31.140> cement<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:32.130> moist<00:02:32.550> areas<00:02:33.180> will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
up so older cement in moist areas will

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
up so older cement in moist areas will
be<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.870> susceptible<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.680> having<00:02:35.330> running

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
be more susceptible to having running

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.539 
be more susceptible to having running
into<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.810> type<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.290> problem<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> really

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
into this type of a problem and I really

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.220 
into this type of a problem and I really
don't<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:39.269> how<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.380> affects<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> entire<00:02:42.569> mix

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
don't know how it affects the entire mix

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.860 
don't know how it affects the entire mix
if<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.709> weakens<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.280> considerably<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.750> it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
if it weakens it considerably or if it's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.930 
if it weakens it considerably or if it's
just<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:47.060> small<00:02:48.290> small<00:02:49.290> amount<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.370> let's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
just a small small amount you know let's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.500 
just a small small amount you know let's
just<00:02:51.120> say<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:52.610> 2,500<00:02:53.610> psi<00:02:53.819> mix

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
just say that you have a 2,500 psi mix

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870 
just say that you have a 2,500 psi mix
and<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.959> only<00:02:55.110> reduces<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:56.010> down<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.549> or

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and it only reduces it down to or

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.080 
and it only reduces it down to or
reduces<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> 2,400<00:02:59.160> pound<00:02:59.549> mix

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
reduces it down to a 2,400 pound mix

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.210 
reduces it down to a 2,400 pound mix
then<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.110> might<00:03:01.319> not<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.829> big<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
then that might not be that big of a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.600 
then that might not be that big of a
problem<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.950> obviously<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.190> wouldn't<00:03:05.519> be

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
problem but obviously this wouldn't be

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.640 
problem but obviously this wouldn't be
something<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.299> get<00:03:06.510> at<00:03:06.810> if<00:03:07.500> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
something you would get at if you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.850 
something you would get at if you
ordered<00:03:08.040> ready<00:03:08.310> mix<00:03:08.640> concrete<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.860> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
ordered ready mix concrete and I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.559 
ordered ready mix concrete and I
shouldn't<00:03:11.220> even<00:03:11.400> say<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.540> have

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
shouldn't even say that because I have

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.809 
shouldn't even say that because I have
ordered<00:03:13.170> I've<00:03:13.620> been<00:03:13.769> surprised<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.579> time<00:03:14.790> I

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
ordered I've been surprised one time I

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.940 
ordered I've been surprised one time I
ordered<00:03:15.299> ready<00:03:15.540> mix<00:03:15.810> concrete<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.560> had<00:03:16.739> a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
ordered ready mix concrete and had a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.550 
ordered ready mix concrete and had a
ball<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.700> size<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.269> volleyball<00:03:18.560> come

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
ball the size of a volleyball come

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.349 
ball the size of a volleyball come
rolling<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:22.079> chute<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.400> so

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
rolling out of the chute there so

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.569 
rolling out of the chute there so
obviously<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:28.500> ready<00:03:28.859> mix<00:03:29.130> places

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
obviously they do in ready mix places

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.849 
obviously they do in ready mix places
they<00:03:29.730> do<00:03:29.790> recycle<00:03:30.389> older<00:03:30.930> concrete<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.799> you

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
they do recycle older concrete so you

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.970 
they do recycle older concrete so you
could<00:03:32.130> end<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:33.180> problem<00:03:33.600> there<00:03:34.049> so

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
could end up with a problem there so

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.259 
could end up with a problem there so
anyway<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.519> throw<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.299> out<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:38.060> if<00:03:39.060> you

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
anyway just throw that out there if you

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.000 
anyway just throw that out there if you
liked<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> video<00:03:39.930> feel<00:03:39.959> free<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.500> hit<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.769> old
