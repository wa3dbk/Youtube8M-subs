of<00:00:37.260> background<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.980> model<00:00:38.219> before<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.489> go

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of background on this model before we go

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.020 
of background on this model before we go
into<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> actual<00:00:38.969> detail<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> animal<00:00:39.840> now

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
when this model was first and better

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.720 
when this model was first and better
think<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> 2008<00:00:44.550> people<00:00:45.329> went<00:00:45.989> nuts<00:00:46.730> or

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
this was the first time that Papo did a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.619 
this was the first time that Papo did a
dinosaur<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.129> wasn't<00:00:53.550> based<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.120> an<00:00:54.270> animal

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
known as soar Fagin axe which is also

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.319 
known as soar Fagin axe which is also
now<00:02:03.119> soared<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:04.110> much<00:02:04.320> larger<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:06.149> it's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
now soared but much larger but it's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
these are bony arms as I call them but

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.940 
these are bony arms as I call them but
one<00:04:07.890> good<00:04:08.069> thing<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:09.329> large<00:04:09.799> nor<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
one good thing is that the large nor the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.940 
one good thing is that the large nor the
first<00:04:11.160> claw<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.819> actually<00:04:12.209> enlarged

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
first claw here is actually enlarged

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.620 
first claw here is actually enlarged
which<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.280> actually<00:04:14.700> based<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.239> actual

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
which is actually based on actual

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.020 
which is actually based on actual
allosaurus<00:04:16.200> evidence<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.889> know<00:04:17.609> isn't<00:04:17.820> that

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
allosaurus evidence I know isn't that

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.879 
allosaurus evidence I know isn't that
great<00:04:18.180> there<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.539> popper<00:04:18.750> first<00:04:19.680> put

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
great there that popper first put

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.680 
great there that popper first put
accuracy<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.669> their<00:04:20.820> models<00:04:21.090> by<00:04:21.299> doing<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.630> on

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
accuracy on their models by doing it on

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.960 
accuracy on their models by doing it on
an<00:04:21.750> Allosaurus<00:04:22.080> but<00:04:22.349> yes<00:04:22.550> see<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.789> big

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
an Allosaurus but yes see that the big

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.450 
an Allosaurus but yes see that the big
cool<00:04:24.180> air<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.450> enlarged<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.680> feet<00:04:25.919> also

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
cool air is enlarged and the feet also

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.780 
cool air is enlarged and the feet also

put on this book my plant dinosaur book

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.970 
put on this book my plant dinosaur book
as<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.370> see<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:33.030> spinosaurus<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.690> it

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
as you can see the spinosaurus on it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.320 
as you can see the spinosaurus on it
we've<00:04:34.980> got<00:04:35.160> more<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:35.730> crocodile

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
we've got more of this like crocodile

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.960 
we've got more of this like crocodile
skin<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.900> goes<00:04:37.050> all<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.230> way<00:04:37.290> down<00:04:37.850> let's<00:04:38.850> go

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
skin that goes all the way down let's go

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.740 
skin that goes all the way down let's go
all<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.120> way<00:04:39.240> down<00:04:39.660> these<00:04:40.080> enlarged<00:04:40.680> spikes

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
all the way down these enlarged spikes

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.560 
all the way down these enlarged spikes
from<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> head<00:04:43.110> back<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.640> tail<00:04:45.000> they<00:04:45.420> go

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
from the head back and the tail they go

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.810 
from the head back and the tail they go
all<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.750> way<00:04:45.810> down<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.200> tail<00:04:46.670> curves

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
all the way down to the tail curves

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.780 
all the way down to the tail curves
there's<00:04:48.630> no<00:04:48.870> cloaca<00:04:49.440> opening<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.460> really

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
there's no cloaca opening but I really

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.700 
there's no cloaca opening but I really
do<00:04:50.910> like<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.240> color<00:04:51.570> scheme<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.230> love<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
do like the color scheme I love the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.030 
do like the color scheme I love the
orange<00:04:53.270> as<00:04:54.270> well<00:04:54.630> with<00:04:55.020> like<00:04:55.290> these<00:04:55.500> blacks

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
orange as well with like these blacks

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.260 
orange as well with like these blacks
and<00:04:56.460> grays<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.300> lime-green<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:59.000> I'm<00:05:00.000> green

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
and grays and the lime-green I I'm green

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.990 
and grays and the lime-green I I'm green
belly<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.100> underside<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.160> think<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.700> really

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
belly and underside I think it really

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.990 
belly and underside I think it really
complements<00:05:03.480> it<00:05:03.720> well<00:05:04.430> it's<00:05:05.430> really<00:05:05.610> good<00:05:05.820> and

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
complements it well it's really good and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.730 
complements it well it's really good and
then<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.390> perfectly<00:05:06.750> stands<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.320> its<00:05:07.470> own<00:05:07.560> two

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
then it perfectly stands on its own two

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.880 
then it perfectly stands on its own two
feet<00:05:07.770> with<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> flat<00:05:08.520> surface<00:05:11.030> now<00:05:12.410> know<00:05:13.410> you

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
feet with a flat surface now know you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.440 
feet with a flat surface now know you
might<00:05:14.070> not<00:05:14.220> know<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:14.670> I<00:05:14.820> actually<00:05:15.030> have

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
might not know this but I actually have

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.550 
might not know this but I actually have
two<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:16.200> these<00:05:16.500> guys<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:18.720> will<00:05:18.780> explain<00:05:19.320> why

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
two of these guys and I will explain why

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.480 
two of these guys and I will explain why
I<00:05:19.590> have<00:05:19.920> two<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:21.300> one<00:05:21.600> here<00:05:22.100> was<00:05:23.100> actually<00:05:23.220> my

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
I have two this one here was actually my

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.560 
I have two this one here was actually my
first<00:05:23.700> Allosaurus<00:05:24.650> however<00:05:25.650> though<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:27.270> feet

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
first Allosaurus however though the feet

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.480 
first Allosaurus however though the feet
this<00:05:27.990> look<00:05:28.230> are<00:05:28.980> completely<00:05:30.170> screwed<00:05:31.170> up

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
this look are completely screwed up

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.210 
this look are completely screwed up
tuned<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:32.930> curly<00:05:33.930> balance<00:05:34.230> on<00:05:34.440> that<00:05:34.500> back

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
tuned see curly balance on that back

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.510 
tuned see curly balance on that back
foot<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:36.390> jaw

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
foot and the jaw

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.360 
foot and the jaw
it<00:05:38.520> doesn't<00:05:38.970> even<00:05:39.060> open<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:41.040> you've<00:05:41.160> got<00:05:41.340> a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
it doesn't even open so you've got a

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.160 
it doesn't even open so you've got a
really<00:05:41.610> pull<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.120> out<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.390> its<00:05:42.510> socket<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:43.050> have

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
really pull it out of its socket to have

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.830 
really pull it out of its socket to have
it<00:05:43.260> open<00:05:43.620> which<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:45.120> really<00:05:45.600> big

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
it open which is a really really big

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.720 
it open which is a really really big
disappointment<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.560> when<00:05:46.920> I<00:05:46.950> got<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.310> one

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
disappointment so when I got this one

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.310 
disappointment so when I got this one
I<00:05:47.760> asked<00:05:47.880> for<00:05:47.970> a<00:05:48.090> replacement<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.230> was

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
I asked for a replacement and it was

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.510 
I asked for a replacement and it was
this<00:05:49.410> one<00:05:49.590> but<00:05:50.220> also<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.670> can<00:05:51.120> actually<00:05:51.420> see

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
this one but also you can actually see

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.550 
this one but also you can actually see
these<00:05:53.520> guys<00:05:53.820> actually<00:05:54.090> have<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.960> little<00:05:55.260> bit<00:05:55.410> of

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
these guys actually have a little bit of

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.890 
these guys actually have a little bit of
a<00:05:55.650> color<00:05:55.950> scheme<00:05:56.280> difference<00:05:56.750> because<00:05:57.750> this

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
a color scheme difference because this

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.860 
a color scheme difference because this
Allosaurus<00:05:58.410> has<00:05:58.530> got<00:05:58.770> some<00:05:58.980> red<00:05:59.690> on<00:06:00.690> its

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
Allosaurus has got some red on its

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.460 
Allosaurus has got some red on its
shoulders<00:06:01.790> which<00:06:02.790> slides<00:06:03.180> up<00:06:03.360> here<00:06:03.390> when<00:06:04.320> that

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
shoulders which slides up here when that

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.990 
shoulders which slides up here when that
one<00:06:04.710> doesn't<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.220> color<00:06:05.640> scheme<00:06:05.910> is<00:06:06.030> more<00:06:08.000> no

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
one doesn't and color scheme is more no

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.660 
one doesn't and color scheme is more no
so<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:09.810> lighter<00:06:10.230> in<00:06:10.650> comparison<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.520> old

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
so I lighter in comparison to the old

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.540
