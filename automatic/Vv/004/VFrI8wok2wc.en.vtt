00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.569
 and now all I know m 47 english I come 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.310
 with the first part of a small 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.310
 series of external hysteria critics 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.630
 in extension on the map point is contact 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.790
 there is a sign that says girls the motes 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.250
 in which the only ones back lit 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.050
 They are forming the word a lot is 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.640
 I thought that this was the end of installing 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.279
 but it turned out to be a clue for the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.020
 secret that I will explain below in 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.940
 that same map can be made that the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.010
 enemies explode in piles of teddy bears 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.510
 stuffed aliens to activate the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.820
 ix to have what you have to do is 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.250
 shoot at the letters lol on the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 word lodge of the sign you must 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.899
 shoot him next to him and to the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.600
 air again for it to take effect 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.850
 apparently it can only be achieved with a 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.500
 sniper rifle and take several 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.960
 attempts before activating the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 eastern you will know that you did it well 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.950
 when it seems written in letters of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.290
 colors on your screen from that moment 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.570
 the history that will be activated this 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.219
 secret works temporarily but it 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.129
 can activate several times during a 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.320
 same game technically this is not a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.910
 mystery but it could be known recently 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 time you can share your money 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.560
 with other players you should simply 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 jump and keep the button pressed 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.100
 a few seconds more in front of you 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.080
 a box will appear 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 and the other players can reach 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.950
 collect money for this to work 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 you must have several thousand dollars 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.740
 because otherwise you will not have the amount 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.390
 required to share if you decided 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.090
 you do not want to give it you can also 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.250
 have your own money back in the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.990
 flubber multiplayer map there is a bear of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.549
 hidden stuffed toy which is a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.950
 very common story in all games 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.960
 from the series of adolf hitler go to the center 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 from the map and stand on the roof of a bus 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.039
 that is submerged towards the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 north you'll see a broken pipeline and without 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.810
 scales and upload you will find the bear 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.610
 over on the multiplayer map on the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 arena is the next bear of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.319
 stuffed animal which can be seen through 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.210
 the window of a closed office the bear 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.220
 can be seen on top of a desk with 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.280
 a construction helmet on his head and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.840
 a cup of coffee in a hand a couple 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.789
 of teddy bears can also be 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.640
 found in a cardboard box in no 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.140
 see them the interest is a bit difficult to 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.299
 find since the box is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 partially closed and it is difficult to migrate 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.200
 inside but if the angle is found 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.549
 right where to see you can 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.690
 find two teddy bears 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.970
 sharing drinks 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 the next and last teddy bear will 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 find in a place that can not be 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.810
 access playing normally only 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.150
 can access in viewer mode in 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.130
 the map looks at klatten in the middle of the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 field and look for a large extended pipe 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.840
 the teddy bear is 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.630
 inside this pipeline all the maps 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.310
 of messes and consoles have a hive to 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.530
 which players can shoot for 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.150
 extra experience points if the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.000
 players shoot at the four palm trees 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.720
 and destroy another in extinction will receive 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 10,000 additional experience points 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.250
 in the prison multiplayer mode 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 located near the available point or the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.030
 federation you can find a monkey 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.040
 rabid with an electric saw on top 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.680
 of the trees relatively close to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.060
 where the cataract is and this 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 It has been everything I hope you liked it
