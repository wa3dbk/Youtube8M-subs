and I
didn't<00:02:34.769> mind<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.190> because<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.489> thought<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
didn't mind that because I thought it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.160 
didn't mind that because I thought it
was<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.879> turn-on<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.900> were<00:02:36.989> very

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
was a turn-on that like they were very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
was a turn-on that like they were very
successful<00:02:37.349> they<00:02:37.920> were<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.190> driven<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.910> as

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
successful they were very driven but as

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.259 
successful they were very driven but as
a<00:02:39.150> guy<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> will<00:02:39.750> admit<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> if<00:02:40.290> someone<00:02:40.590> made

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
a guy I will admit that if someone made

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.759 
a guy I will admit that if someone made
way<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.300> than<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> did<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.200> would<00:02:43.590> probably

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
way more than I did I would probably

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.900 
way more than I did I would probably
have<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.069> problem<00:02:44.160> with<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:44.879> very

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
have a problem with it because I'm very

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
have a problem with it because I'm very
old<00:02:45.239> fashioned<00:02:45.660> where<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.840> believe<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.470> man

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
old fashioned where I do believe the man

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.990 
old fashioned where I do believe the man
should<00:02:46.860> be<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> provider<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.489> protect<00:02:47.849> her

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
should be the provider and protect her

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.449 
should be the provider and protect her
if<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:49.019> really<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:49.830> liked<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
if you really really really liked a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
woman she made way more money thinking

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.920 
woman she made way more money thinking
he<00:02:52.980> wouldn't<00:02:53.280> date<00:02:53.459> her<00:02:53.610> no<00:02:54.120> no<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.239> would<00:02:54.690> still

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
he wouldn't date her no no I would still

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.460 
he wouldn't date her no no I would still
date<00:02:55.140> her<00:02:55.819> because<00:02:56.819> I'm<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> hound<00:02:57.569> no<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> would

I'd probably make an incentive like I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.470 
I'd probably make an incentive like I
need<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:02.670> successful<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.299> don't
