because<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.590> will<00:03:01.709> tell<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
because that will tell you the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.070 
because that will tell you the
coordinates<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.360> tells<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> C

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
coordinates where it tells you the C

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.410 
coordinates where it tells you the C
that<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.410> put<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.280> tutorial<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.270> can

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that you put in the tutorial or it can

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.310 
that you put in the tutorial or it can
tell<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.680> numerical<00:03:08.340> value<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
tell you the numerical value of it and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.180 
tell you the numerical value of it and
basically<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> top<00:03:10.680> right<00:03:10.890> hand<00:03:11.010> corner

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
basically in the top right hand corner

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.520 
basically in the top right hand corner
it<00:03:11.580> will<00:03:11.760> tell<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.600> biome<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.290> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
it will tell you the biome it's in and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770 
it will tell you the biome it's in and
what<00:03:14.070> where<00:03:14.730> your<00:03:14.910> mouse<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.239> pointing<00:03:15.630> at

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
what where your mouse is pointing at

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.870 
what where your mouse is pointing at
currently<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.799> that's<00:03:17.160> pretty<00:03:17.430> neat<00:03:17.700> arm

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
currently so that's pretty neat arm

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640 
currently so that's pretty neat arm
we'll<00:03:18.150> make<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.540> bigger<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:19.320> we'll<00:03:19.500> zoom

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
we'll make it bigger and then we'll zoom

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.130 
we'll make it bigger and then we'll zoom
out<00:03:19.830> with<00:03:20.010> our<00:03:20.160> scroll<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.610> our<00:03:20.970> mouse<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.510> you

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
out with our scroll on our mouse so you

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.050 
out with our scroll on our mouse so you
can<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> bunch<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.220> things<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.910> can

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
can see a bunch of things like you can

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.750 
can see a bunch of things like you can
see<00:03:24.239> another<00:03:24.510> fortress<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.410> etc<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
see another fortress in and etc but the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.729 
see another fortress in and etc but the
thing<00:03:26.970> about<00:03:27.000> nether<00:03:27.450> fortresses<00:03:28.080> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
thing about nether fortresses that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.640 
thing about nether fortresses that
coordinate<00:03:29.220> shows<00:03:29.549> up<00:03:29.760> with<00:03:29.970> negative<00:03:30.150> 163<00:03:31.140> 68

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
coordinate shows up with negative 163 68

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220 
coordinate shows up with negative 163 68
that's<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.310> coordinates<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.180> nether<00:03:33.510> not

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that's the coordinates in the nether not

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
that's the coordinates in the nether not
like<00:03:34.590> where<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.830> actually<00:03:35.250> build<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.640> portal

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
like where you actually build the portal

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
like where you actually build the portal
so<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> best<00:03:37.680> accordance<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.340> will

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
so you have the best accordance you will

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.660 
so you have the best accordance you will
go<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.120> another<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.989> like<00:03:40.350> don't<00:03:41.190> get

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
go to in another so like don't get

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.210 
go to in another so like don't get
yourself<00:03:41.760> fooled<00:03:42.269> by<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.769> but<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.070> can

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
yourself fooled by that but like you can

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.860 
yourself fooled by that but like you can
see<00:03:44.400> there's<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.640> sand<00:03:45.000> temple<00:03:45.390> right<00:03:45.600> here<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
see there's a sand temple right here a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660 
see there's a sand temple right here a
desert<00:03:46.260> temple<00:03:46.920> whatever<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.340> want<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.549> call

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
desert temple whatever you want to call

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.150 
desert temple whatever you want to call
it<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.600> pretty<00:03:48.930> neat<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.950> thing<00:03:50.130> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
it which is pretty neat but the thing is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
it which is pretty neat but the thing is
in<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.549> bottom<00:03:50.970> right<00:03:51.120> corner<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> see<00:03:51.690> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
in that bottom right corner you see that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
in that bottom right corner you see that
little<00:03:52.019> marker<00:03:52.440> thing<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> pencil

or whatever you want to call it well you
can<00:03:56.850> search<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.390> specific<00:03:57.630> bonds<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.350> you

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
can search for specific bonds that you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.259 
can search for specific bonds that you
want<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.799> know<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> lot<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.220> people<00:03:59.670> you<00:04:00.150> know

want you know a lot of people you know
search<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:01.200> Mesa<00:04:01.890> bonds<00:04:02.250> because<00:04:02.519> they<00:04:02.640> want

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
search for Mesa bonds because they want

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.520 
search for Mesa bonds because they want
that<00:04:02.910> hardened<00:04:03.360> clay<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.780> there's<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.170> six

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
that hardened clay but there's like six

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.100 
that hardened clay but there's like six
different<00:04:04.739> types<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.400> Mesa<00:04:05.820> bond<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.420> boom

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
different types of Mesa bond so boom

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.789 
different types of Mesa bond so boom
boom

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
boom

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.590 
boom
now<00:04:08.160> we<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> full<00:04:08.730> thing<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.180> really

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
now we have the full thing is really

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.150 
now we have the full thing is really
close<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.870> our<00:04:10.019> spawn<00:04:10.350> point<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.739> like<00:04:10.920> this

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
close to our spawn point so like this

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.190 
close to our spawn point so like this
looks<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.610> pretty<00:04:11.940> good<00:04:12.150> seed<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:12.840> you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
looks like a pretty good seed if you

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.530 
looks like a pretty good seed if you
were<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.680> be<00:04:13.799> interested<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.370> Mesa<00:04:14.549> bombs<00:04:14.880> like

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
were to be interested in Mesa bombs like

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.270 
were to be interested in Mesa bombs like
you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.870> even<00:04:16.079> unselect<00:04:16.650> them<00:04:16.709> all<00:04:16.890> at<00:04:17.040> once

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
you can even unselect them all at once

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.949 
you can even unselect them all at once
that<00:04:17.519> way<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.729> don't<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.150> trouble<00:04:18.570> or

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
that way you don't have the trouble or

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.270 
that way you don't have the trouble or
maybe<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.229> want<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.440> suck<00:04:19.560> them<00:04:19.739> all<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.190> like

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
maybe you want to suck them all and like

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640 
maybe you want to suck them all and like
slowly<00:04:20.549> deselect<00:04:21.150> them<00:04:21.450> at<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.690> time<00:04:21.900> but

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
slowly deselect them at a time but

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.200 
slowly deselect them at a time but
probably<00:04:23.130> one<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> big<00:04:23.700> things<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.090> guys

so<00:04:32.370> that's<00:04:32.520> where<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:32.820> would<00:04:32.910> go<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.240> this

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
so that's where you would go in this

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.029 
so that's where you would go in this
world<00:04:33.539> yes<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.050> test<00:04:34.289> it<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.530> yourself<00:04:34.860> it's

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
world yes to test it for yourself it's

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:42.140 
world yes to test it for yourself it's
at<00:04:35.190> 7:04<00:04:36.200> um<00:04:37.370> X's<00:04:38.370> 704<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.300> then<00:04:39.890> Z<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.550> think

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
at 7:04 um X's 704 and then Z is I think

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.740 
at 7:04 um X's 704 and then Z is I think
it's<00:04:42.450> Z<00:04:42.630> Z<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.200> negative<00:04:43.560> 1<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.220> 8<00:04:44.430> 0<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:45.450> that

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
it's Z Z is negative 1 to 8 0 so that

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.240 
it's Z Z is negative 1 to 8 0 so that
will<00:04:45.810> be<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.140> thing<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.680> guys<00:04:46.770> can<00:04:47.010> search

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
will be a thing that you guys can search

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.040 
will be a thing that you guys can search
to<00:04:47.490> verify<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:47.940> this<00:04:48.360> program<00:04:48.810> actually

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
to verify that this program actually

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.100 
to verify that this program actually
works<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:49.979> that's<00:04:50.099> pretty<00:04:50.370> neat<00:04:50.780> but<00:04:51.780> one<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
works so that's pretty neat but one of

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.089 
works so that's pretty neat but one of
the<00:04:52.200> big<00:04:52.380> things<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.919> guys<00:04:53.039> are

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
the big things that you guys are

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
probably wondering I don't see any other

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.710 
probably wondering I don't see any other
fortresses<00:04:55.979> but<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.729> is<00:04:56.910> disabled<00:04:57.479> right

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
fortresses but that is disabled right
