00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.389 
track and you don't if it's rather maybe
this<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.319> an<00:01:42.439> instance<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:42.890> he<00:01:42.979> has<00:01:43.069> been<00:01:43.189> dead

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
this is an instance but he has been dead

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.980 
this is an instance but he has been dead
us<00:01:43.490> again<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:43.939> this<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.569> the<00:01:44.659> rear<00:01:44.840> which

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
us again and this is the rear which

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.450 
us again and this is the rear which
shadi<00:01:45.229> does<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.679> cook<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.950> tire<00:01:46.189> at<00:01:46.340> any

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
shadi does just cook the tire at any

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.480 
shadi does just cook the tire at any
went<00:01:46.759> man<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.990> big<00:01:48.140> hit<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.530> went<00:01:48.829> in<00:01:48.979> flat

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
went man it's a big hit it went in flat

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.910 
went man it's a big hit it went in flat
so<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.819> probably<00:01:50.450> saved<00:01:50.780> too<00:01:51.200> much<00:01:51.470> damage

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
so that probably saved too much damage

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.780 
so that probably saved too much damage

should<00:01:58.560> rename<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.400> just<00:01:59.640> plucked<00:01:59.850> in<00:01:59.970> and

should rename it see just plucked in and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.910 
should rename it see just plucked in and
in<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.300> hit<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> other<00:02:01.110> key<00:02:01.320> which<00:02:01.500> launched

in it hit the other key which launched
and<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.280> thing<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.580> these<00:02:02.700> little
