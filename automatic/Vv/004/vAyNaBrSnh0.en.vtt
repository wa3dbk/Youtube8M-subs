00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
definitely would you go out dancing with
the<00:01:23.939> stars<00:01:29.509> there's<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.659> much<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:30.960> money<00:01:31.110> now

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the stars there's so much more money now

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
the stars there's so much more money now
throwing<00:01:32.250> young<00:01:32.490> surfers<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
then it will end up supporting not only

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
then it will end up supporting not only
their<00:01:36.420> parents<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.020> their<00:01:37.200> siblings<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.680> well

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

coming<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.960> pretty<00:01:43.259> radical<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.189> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
coming in it's pretty radical the way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
coming in it's pretty radical the way
that<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.820> coming<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.570> really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that it's coming in it's like really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
that it's coming in it's like really
really<00:01:46.560> young<00:01:46.740> kids<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.340> grown<00:01:47.640> up
