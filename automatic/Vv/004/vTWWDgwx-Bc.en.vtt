00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 hello my name is jen I 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.140
 I represent the curtain cabin emphasis and all 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 on loans as you know a lot 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 cars are now bought it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 loan and today we talk to the loan 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.369
 our dealership specialists call him 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.590
 pavel pavel hello hello hello 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.710
 give a few questions most 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.230
 popular and answer for you on them on 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 the first question is why take a car loan 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.320
 profitable as if the first reason for 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.600
 which people give car loans for this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.879
 the moment is of course just a lack of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.280
 present moment of cash here and this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.739
 convenient because you can take the goods in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 the moment the car is on the sly 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.170
 pays yes and already enjoy 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 the goods are now very much large mass 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.360
 loan programs and second moment on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.710
 why people can't do it 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.210
 accumulate and the reason is not that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.330
 weak willpower yes there is such a thing as 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 inflation inflation is cheaper money 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 per unit of time per year 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.840
 for example, that's an average if you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.789
 look for the year inflation is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.740
 about 10 percent ie money 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.780
 become cheaper accordingly when a person 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 saves on car from 500,000 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.539
 it's hard for him to save because the car 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.789
 in fact going up every time here and here 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.229
 second moment why car loan exactly 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.940
 profitable because firstly he 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.179
 different other loan low 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.619
 betting fleet and take it even some 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.840
 businessmen people who basically 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.539
 is there cash to buy 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.270
 car take it to not 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.860
 pull out of business that is much 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 more convenient to pay some kind of payment where 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.789
 the overpayment will actually 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.910
 roughly the same inflation that is it 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.580
 about 10-15 percent will be 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.860
 here and use cars already 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.080
 money in the business is clear there is 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.090
 two types of loan and tomorrow and 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.429
 consumer perlite in what 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.429
 track car loans are surprised 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.380
 two forms 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 different lending key difference in 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.760
 that car loans target credit 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 have it goes specifically to purchase 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.040
 car i mean the car goes to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.240
 first locking the bank until the man is 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.620
 calculated and secondly 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.209
 there must be some kind of salon which 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.100
 sells this car u that is 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.260
 consumer credit store 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.820
 different different forum this is untargeted 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.010
 credit for any desired person is simple 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.170
 comes to the bank and take money in what 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.670
 the difference is a percentage difference very 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.190
 large that is consumer credit 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.510
 five points more expensive that is 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.600
 5 percent more expensive 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.670
 more is a more complex package 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.320
 documents this is a limit on the amount to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.950
 million rubles about average we 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 percentage approval required by the Bank below 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.110
 clear but often asked such a question 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.310
 can I buy a car on credit where 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.769
 Casco insurance 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 that's what casco insurance is and why 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.459
 it's profitable 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.100
 you can buy a car as insurance 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.140
 Casco and without it the program is different but 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.010
 there is one important such interesting 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.510
 nuance about which few people know let's say 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.459
 take the car first tell me 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.040
 only cascade 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.380
 Casco is a type of insurance which 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.500
 insures your car directly 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.570
 from crash from any damage from 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.450
 impact of third parties with elevator nail 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.420
 scratched if a stone fell there no matter 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.010
 if burned or stolen it gives it 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.049
 gives you peace of mind first 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.480
 the fact that your car is safe and 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.940
 it gives the bank the same guarantees and 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.780
 thanks to this he reduces the rate 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.930
 much now appeared in variations 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.360
 how would car loans without casco in what 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.500
 the difference would seem to be more profitable gifts 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.239
 people say they don't need 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.060
 pay extra 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.240
 but the secret is that banks will develop 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.340
 program specifically to 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.680
 due to their risks that they bear 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.630
 increase the interest rate and if 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.519
 look at the payment then you are in fact 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.350
 pay the same money to the bank because of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.910
 Casco this is imperceptible because 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.100
 it seems like a payment and even then a year 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.650
 broken really you 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.060
 overpaying the same insurance but the bank 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 takes no responsibility your 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.250
 car and any damage to you 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.230
 recover at your own expense 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.900
 Excellent and now often 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.610
 ask a question whether you can buy a car in 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.830
 loan without down payment 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.890
 year our question is need some 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.380
 down payment when you buy 3d 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.710
 see there are programs without 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.900
 down payment and maybe buy 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.900
 the car is absolutely like its own 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.760
 cash but there are important 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.480
 nuances I would not advise doing it 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.210
 because the banks that are on such 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.010
 programs they are very high rates this 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.210
 unprofitable that is a person very much 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.050
 overpay because the bank bears the risk 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.169
 I'll tell you a little about why 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.520
 down payment banks take 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.950
 down payment in advance for what 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 if after processing the loan the person is not 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.250
 can pay 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.950
 car bank charges since on in 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.830
 pledge and bank need to sell this 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.230
 car to repay debt to 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.240
 sell it 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.040
 10-20 percent below the market so he 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.770
 sold normally the more so because 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.300
 time and he was in operation that's it 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.980
 for this banks take the initial 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.110
 a fee so how would the risk layer 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.090
 save without down payment 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.210
 the risk is increased and the banks are not 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.400
 feel free to wind up not weak interest 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.350
 that's why a down payment I would 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120
 advised at least a minimum of 10 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.010
 percent still need to do 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.720
 then very profitable programs are possible 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:02.390
 here rather than from him there are two 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.200
 concepts such as interest rate and 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.000
 overpayment 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.680
 and what is the difference 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.340
 he needs to orient himself 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:14.000
 business yes this is another interesting point 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.590
 there is a bunch of ads a bunch of sites on each 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.870
 each bank where i'm a different different 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.520
 different rates and consumer when 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.350
 the first time he chooses where 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.700
 turn looks at the rate of course 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.190
 where below actually look 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.950
 I need to ask for payment 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.570
 calculate it payment and just monthly 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.550
 payment and multiply by the number of months 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.010
 take away the body of the loan money that you 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.720
 They took it and see for real how much 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.480
 give money because unfortunately 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.910
 the reality is that these percentages 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.760
 who auto loans banks recite 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.000
 This is a bogus interest on it as 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.669
 their reasons why banks do it 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.990
 This separately need to tell here but on 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.510
 really a formula 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.580
 from the rate to pay at the bank each 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.320
 own separate and totally different then 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.750
 there may be one bank 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.940
 gives let's say 16 percent 2 gang it 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.760
 16 percent but in this bank payment 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.910
 6000k in this 5 here and you need to watch 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.740
 necessarily on the payment and in this way 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.630
 the percentage of real overpayment can be 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.970
 calculate just mathematically by series 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:23.229
 ask the question which is the easiest 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:27.110
 way to get a car loan 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:30.710
 make it really very simple 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.780
 for this you need to have the client with you 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.640
 passport and driver's license 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.160
 come to us fill out the questionnaire and 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.110
 actually all wait a couple of days 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.070
 the decision will be received and several 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.590
 options from which you can choose 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.300
 this was clearly our last question 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.860
 Thanks to Paul for very detailed answers. 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.860
 and all bye 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:57.040
 good luck see you
