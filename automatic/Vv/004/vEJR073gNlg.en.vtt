was<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.779> original<00:00:20.080> bit<00:00:20.439> of<00:00:20.529> copper<00:00:20.740> and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
was the original bit of copper and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.669 
was the original bit of copper and
they've<00:00:21.070> just<00:00:21.099> folded<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:21.730> back<00:00:22.679> still

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
they've just folded that back still

they've just folded that back still
there<00:00:23.890> when<00:00:24.099> you<00:00:24.189> need<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.550> take<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.269> out<00:00:25.480> if

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
there when you need to take this out if

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.480 
there when you need to take this out if
you<00:00:25.720> want<00:00:25.929> but<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.560> prefer<00:00:26.650> to<00:00:27.009> keep<00:00:27.160> it<00:00:27.279> in<00:00:27.400> here

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
you want but I prefer to keep it in here

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.439 
you want but I prefer to keep it in here
it's<00:00:27.640> pretty<00:00:27.820> handy<00:00:28.119> so<00:00:29.109> we've<00:00:29.320> got<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:30.070> box

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it's pretty handy so we've got the box

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.330 
it's pretty handy so we've got the box
we've<00:00:31.449> got<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.960> leads<00:00:32.649> at<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.860> front<00:00:33.129> there

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
we've got the leads at the front there

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.549 
we've got the leads at the front there
which<00:00:33.550> obviously<00:00:34.000> would<00:00:34.930> be<00:00:34.989> connecting<00:00:35.530> to

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
which obviously would be connecting to

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.470 
which obviously would be connecting to
some<00:00:35.860> sort<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.219> probably<00:00:36.489> sirens<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:37.270> stuff

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480

they've left the plugs on there another
bargain<00:00:42.160> a<00:00:42.399> third<00:00:42.820> plug<00:00:43.120> there<00:00:43.410> these<00:00:44.410> two

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
bargain a third plug there these two

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.010 
bargain a third plug there these two
sets<00:00:45.280> here<00:00:45.610> I'm<00:00:45.820> pretty<00:00:46.360> sure<00:00:46.629> are<00:00:46.809> both

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
sets here I'm pretty sure are both

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.350 
sets here I'm pretty sure are both
positive<00:00:47.289> and<00:00:47.829> this<00:00:48.160> whole<00:00:48.550> set<00:00:48.940> being<00:00:49.149> all

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
positive and this whole set being all

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.069 
positive and this whole set being all
black<00:00:49.539> is<00:00:49.840> negative<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:52.449> grounded<00:00:52.660> it<00:00:52.960> to

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
black is negative I've grounded it to

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.830 
black is negative I've grounded it to
the<00:00:53.199> car<00:00:53.440> just<00:00:53.859> there<00:00:54.129> with<00:00:54.609> this<00:00:54.820> nice<00:00:55.059> thick

ground<00:00:56.109> lead<00:00:57.059> circuit<00:00:58.059> breaker<00:00:58.269> just<00:00:58.629> like<00:00:58.809> up

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
ground lead circuit breaker just like up

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.790 
ground lead circuit breaker just like up
in<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.230> front<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.739> on<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.430> top<00:01:00.640> here<00:01:00.879> a<00:01:01.800> switch

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
in the front is on the top here a switch

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.940 
in the front is on the top here a switch
here<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.309> press<00:01:03.519> brakes<00:01:04.510> it<00:01:04.750> see<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:05.650> little

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
here you press brakes it see this little

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.400 
here you press brakes it see this little
thing<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.370> side<00:01:06.640> comes<00:01:06.970> out<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.410> it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
thing on the side comes out and it

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.440 
thing on the side comes out and it
obviously<00:01:08.530> breaks<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> circuit<00:01:09.270> click<00:01:10.270> back

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
obviously breaks the circuit click back

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.810 
obviously breaks the circuit click back
back<00:01:10.690> back<00:01:10.720> in<00:01:11.110> there<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.220> unscrew<00:01:15.520> this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
back back in there if you unscrew this

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
comes off and this whole black bit here

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.730 
comes off and this whole black bit here
will<00:01:21.760> come<00:01:22.000> up<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.510> off<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:22.930> can<00:01:23.140> get<00:01:23.500> at

the battery in there which is connected

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.620 
the battery in there which is connected
underneath<00:01:26.620> through<00:01:27.490> under<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.360> under

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
along to the top of the battery but very

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.790 
along to the top of the battery but very
easy<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.890> prove<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:36.940> want<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.800> the

easy to prove if you want to and the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
easy to prove if you want to and the
tray<00:01:39.130> he<00:01:39.430> is<00:01:39.490> screwed<00:01:40.120> down<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:41.790> bottom<00:01:42.790> of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
tray he is screwed down to the bottom of

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.270 
tray he is screwed down to the bottom of
the<00:01:42.910> boot<00:01:43.090> he<00:01:43.300> not<00:01:43.930> welded<00:01:44.350> like<00:01:44.560> some<00:01:45.010> others

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the boot he not welded like some others

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.660 
the boot he not welded like some others
of<00:01:45.310> previously<00:01:45.880> set

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
of previously set

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
of previously set
and<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.080> other<00:01:49.530> than

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and now yeah that's about it other than

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.770 
and now yeah that's about it other than
that<00:01:49.950> you've<00:01:50.159> got<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.610> couple<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.120> screws<00:01:51.450> here

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that you've got a couple of screws here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350 
that you've got a couple of screws here
which<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.320> guess<00:01:52.350> were<00:01:52.830> possibly<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> gun

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
which I guess were possibly for a gun

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810 
which I guess were possibly for a gun
rack<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:55.440> something<00:01:55.860> else<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.550> don't<00:01:56.729> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
rack or something else I don't know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.469 
rack or something else I don't know
another<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.869> under<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:59.150> and<00:02:00.150> they've<00:02:00.300> left

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
another one under here and they've left

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.320 
another one under here and they've left
them<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> there<00:02:01.050> oddly<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.920> us<00:02:02.060> also<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:03.300> I

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
them in there oddly for us also when I

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.710 
them in there oddly for us also when I
got<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.690> car<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.619> whining<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.420> not

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
got the car the whining bit here was not

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.169 
got the car the whining bit here was not
attached<00:02:07.050> I'm<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.950> too<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.459> why<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.970> may

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
attached I'm not too sure why they may

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.050 
attached I'm not too sure why they may
have<00:02:09.300> used<00:02:10.070> had<00:02:11.070> something<00:02:11.400> connected<00:02:11.850> like

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
have used had something connected like

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210 
have used had something connected like
the<00:02:12.270> screw<00:02:12.720> hole<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.160> sure

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the screw hole just there I'm not sure

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.809 
the screw hole just there I'm not sure
if<00:02:15.209> they've<00:02:15.420> had<00:02:15.540> something<00:02:15.959> else<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.290> there

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
if they've had something else in there

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.390

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
