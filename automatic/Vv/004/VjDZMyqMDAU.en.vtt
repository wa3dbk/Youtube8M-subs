next we can reattach the board to the
frame

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:34.680

time for the front panel board now we

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.900 
time for the front panel board now we
can<00:02:35.019> add<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.739> our<00:02:35.829> lower<00:02:36.160> case<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.700> then

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
can add this to our lower case and then

00:02:36.910 --> 00:03:42.890 
can add this to our lower case and then
add<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.299> our<00:02:37.450> optical<00:02:37.900> drive<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.110> hard<00:02:38.560> drive

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:04:57.670 

now<00:03:43.900> we<00:03:43.960> can<00:03:44.230> add<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.620> upper<00:03:44.770> metal<00:03:45.190> case

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.540 

let's<00:04:58.680> bring<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:58.979> all<00:04:59.039> together<00:04:59.190> with<00:04:59.520> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
let's bring it all together with the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.339 
let's bring it all together with the
plastic<00:04:59.970> panels<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.570> don't<00:05:00.930> forget<00:05:01.229> to

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
plastic panels but don't forget to

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.960 
plastic panels but don't forget to
attach<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.919> front<00:05:02.190> button<00:05:02.400> cable<00:05:02.669> before

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
attach the front button cable before

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.469 
attach the front button cable before
closing<00:05:03.539> up<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:05.160> front<00:05:05.370> button<00:05:05.639> cable<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.300> be

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
closing up the front button cable can be

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.210 
closing up the front button cable can be
difficult<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:06.990> connect<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.680> recommend<00:05:07.979> you

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
difficult to connect so we recommend you

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.010 
difficult to connect so we recommend you
separate<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.759> front<00:05:08.910> plastic<00:05:09.419> panel<00:05:09.780> from

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
separate the front plastic panel from

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:34.070 
separate the front plastic panel from
the<00:05:10.139> top<00:05:10.320> panel<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.979> easier<00:05:11.340> access

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.719
