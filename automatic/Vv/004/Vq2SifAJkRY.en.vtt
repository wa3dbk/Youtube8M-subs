gonna leave off the go somewhere else

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.430 
gonna leave off the go somewhere else
where<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.280> he<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> is

where can he go we don't know so that is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
where can he go we don't know so that is
one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:43.950> predictions<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> number<00:00:45.059> four<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
one of my predictions and number four I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420 
one of my predictions and number four I
think<00:00:45.390> Slade<00:00:45.870> Wilson<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.500> pretend<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> die

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
think Slade Wilson will pretend to die

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
think Slade Wilson will pretend to die
like<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.090> he<00:00:48.329> did<00:00:48.629> near<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> end<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.649> feel

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
like the way he did near the end I feel

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
like the way he did near the end I feel
like<00:00:50.039> Oliver<00:00:50.910> might<00:00:51.210> kill<00:00:51.570> him<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
like Oliver might kill him to think that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
like Oliver might kill him to think that
he<00:00:52.949> did<00:00:53.160> kill<00:00:53.399> him<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:53.940> he<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.329> dead<00:00:54.600> they

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
he did kill him but he is not dead they

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
he did kill him but he is not dead they
wouldn't<00:00:55.170> kill<00:00:55.590> off<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> great<00:00:56.190> character<00:00:56.430> such

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
wouldn't kill off a great character such

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
wouldn't kill off a great character such
as<00:00:56.879> Slade<00:00:57.390> Wilson<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.989> mono<00:00:58.559> Burnett<00:00:58.920> has

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
as Slade Wilson and mono Burnett has

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
as Slade Wilson and mono Burnett has
been<00:00:59.309> doing<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> great<00:00:59.640> job<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.570> Deathstroke

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
been doing a great job as Deathstroke

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
been doing a great job as Deathstroke
more<00:01:01.829> likely<00:01:02.190> they're<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.399> pretend<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
more likely they're gonna pretend to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
more likely they're gonna pretend to
kill<00:01:03.030> him<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.600> he's<00:01:04.019> didn't<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
kill him off and he's didn't go

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
kill him off and he's didn't go
somewhere<00:01:04.680> else<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.010> might<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.430> him<00:01:05.549> back

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
somewhere else so you might see him back

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
somewhere else so you might see him back
for<00:01:06.299> maybe<00:01:06.450> season<00:01:06.810> 4<00:01:07.080> season<00:01:07.409> 5<00:01:07.560> who<00:01:08.340> knows

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
for maybe season 4 season 5 who knows

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
for maybe season 4 season 5 who knows
I'm<00:01:08.880> saying<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.689> predict<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.290> they're

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
I'm saying that I predict that they're

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
I'm saying that I predict that they're
gonna<00:01:10.710> pretend<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.580> kill<00:01:11.760> him<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gonna pretend to kill him off like the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.760 
gonna pretend to kill him off like the
way<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> number<00:01:13.409> three<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> think

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
way they did and number three I think

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
way they did and number three I think
Greg<00:01:14.220> gunson<00:01:14.729> flash<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.110> more<00:01:16.350> to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.500 
own sister but he knows he cannot do
that<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.459> feel<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.910> in<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> second<00:03:28.389> season

that so I feel that in the second season

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.900 
that so I feel that in the second season
we<00:03:29.169> might<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:29.590> her<00:03:29.709> as<00:03:29.980> as<00:03:30.340> one<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.730> the

we might get her as as one of the

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.210 
we might get her as as one of the
