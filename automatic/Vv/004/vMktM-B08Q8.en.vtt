all right sitting here at my table and

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.010 
all right sitting here at my table and
what<00:00:03.210> we're<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.510> do<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:03.840> to

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.010 
what we're going to do is we're going to
understand<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.980> put<00:00:05.640> together<00:00:05.779> and<00:00:06.779> lit<00:00:06.930> it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
understand and put together and lit it

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.879 
understand and put together and lit it
up<00:00:07.309> electronic<00:00:08.309> air<00:00:09.120> valves<00:00:09.719> these<00:00:10.620> are

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
up electronic air valves these are

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.470 
up electronic air valves these are
quarter-inch<00:00:11.429> they're<00:00:11.910> just<00:00:12.090> little<00:00:12.269> tiny

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
quarter-inch they're just little tiny

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.740 
quarter-inch they're just little tiny
ones<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.469> will<00:00:13.679> work<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.400> any<00:00:14.750> size

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
ones but this will work for any size

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.650 
ones but this will work for any size
electronic<00:00:16.680> valves<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.660> it's

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
electronic valves that you get it's

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.640 
electronic valves that you get it's
really<00:00:18.930> simple

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
really simple

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.160 
really simple
there's<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.460> magnet<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.359> there's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> shaft

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
there's a magnet in here there's a shaft

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
there's a magnet in here there's a shaft
that<00:00:22.350> goes<00:00:22.500> down<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> center<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> when

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that goes down in the center and when

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
that goes down in the center and when
you<00:00:24.390> put<00:00:24.630> power<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.460> magnetized<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you put power to it magnetized as it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.019 
you put power to it magnetized as it
pulls<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.300> shaft<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.949> allowing<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.340> open<00:00:29.880> an

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
pulls a shaft up allowing it to open an

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
pulls a shaft up allowing it to open an
airflow<00:00:30.480> through<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.830> look<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
airflow through if you look at the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
airflow through if you look at the
bottom<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> direction<00:00:33.809> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
bottom you can see the direction of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280 
bottom you can see the direction of
airflow<00:00:34.820> right<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.930> one's<00:00:37.140> got

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
airflow right there see this one's got

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.470 
airflow right there see this one's got
an<00:00:37.410> arrow<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.700> shows<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> air

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
an arrow on it that shows that the air

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.810 
an arrow on it that shows that the air
flows<00:00:39.870> through<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.680> side<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> comes

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
something a little bit better let's see

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.899 
something a little bit better let's see
what<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:24.500> yeah<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:26.759> they

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
what they are yeah that's what kind they

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
what they are yeah that's what kind they
are<00:01:27.650> whatever<00:01:28.650> alright<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
are whatever alright this is the way it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450 
are whatever alright this is the way it
works<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.439> air<00:01:31.619> supply<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.250> comes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
works you have an air supply that comes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230 
works you have an air supply that comes
into<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.840> valve<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.759> have<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> tea

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
into the first valve and you have a tea

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
into the first valve and you have a tea
that<00:01:37.049> goes<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> center<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that goes right there in the center and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.069 
that goes right there in the center and
then<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.960> goes<00:01:40.439> out<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.189> air<00:01:41.340> bag<00:01:42.079> now

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
then this goes out to the air bag now

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
then this goes out to the air bag now
the<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.619> works<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> air<00:01:44.490> comes<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the way this works is the air comes in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
the way this works is the air comes in
when<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> opens<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.350> allows<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> air<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
when this opens it allows the air to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.789 
when this opens it allows the air to
flow<00:01:47.310> through<00:01:47.750> come<00:01:48.750> through<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> out

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
flow through come through here and out

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.929 
flow through come through here and out
to<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.670> single<00:01:51.270> bag<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> dual<00:01:52.649> bag<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to a single bag or a dual bag which that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
to a single bag or a dual bag which that
would<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> front<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.590> truck<00:01:55.920> or

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
would be for the front of your truck or

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.120 
would be for the front of your truck or
the<00:01:56.549> rear<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.240> truck<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> do

all<00:01:59.340> four<00:02:00.380> corners<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> you're<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
all four corners and you're going to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.520 
all four corners and you're going to
build<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:03.450> each<00:02:03.600> corner<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
build one of these for each corner of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
build one of these for each corner of
your<00:02:04.860> truck<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.450> said<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:07.020> goes<00:02:07.290> out

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
your truck so like I said this goes out

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.449 
your truck so like I said this goes out
fills<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.940> air<00:02:09.149> bag<00:02:09.920> allowing<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.099> your

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
then this closes and holds that air in

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.170 
then this closes and holds that air in
there<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.310> you've<00:02:17.459> got<00:02:17.640> another<00:02:17.910> one<00:02:18.150> on

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
there because you've got another one on

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.199 
there because you've got another one on
this<00:02:18.450> side<00:02:18.769> when<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.190> air<00:02:20.940> your

truck out this valve opens up and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.220 
truck out this valve opens up and
releases<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.769> air<00:02:25.950> back<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:28.019> side

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
releases the air back out this this side

phone I have anyway you get the point

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.580 
phone I have anyway you get the point
this<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.959> how<00:03:31.500> electronic<00:03:32.840> air<00:03:33.840> valves<00:03:34.319> work

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
this is how electronic air valves work

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
this is how electronic air valves work
there<00:03:35.340> are<00:03:35.609> two<00:03:36.269> wires<00:03:37.019> per<00:03:37.799> valve<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:39.359> have<00:03:39.569> a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
there are two wires per valve you have a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.890 
there are two wires per valve you have a
positive<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.980> negative<00:03:41.010> wire<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:42.569> send

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
positive and a negative wire you send

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
positive and a negative wire you send
power<00:03:43.079> through<00:03:43.410> here<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.829> then<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.160> turns

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
power through here and then that turns

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.349 
power through here and then that turns
that<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.500> all<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.739> got<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.359> take

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
that on so that's all you got to do take

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059 
that on so that's all you got to do take
one<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.720> these<00:03:48.780> wires<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.260> connect<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.889> to<00:03:50.040> a

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
one of these wires and connect it to a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.569 
one of these wires and connect it to a
ground<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:51.450> other<00:03:51.500> two<00:03:52.500> wires<00:03:52.739> go<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.280> your

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
ground the other two wires go to your

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.599 
ground the other two wires go to your
switches<00:03:54.350> one<00:03:55.350> switch<00:03:55.790> per<00:03:57.079> valve<00:03:58.609> unless

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
switches one switch per valve unless

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.680 
switches one switch per valve unless
you're<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.970> use<00:04:00.209> them<00:04:00.359> all<00:04:00.569> at<00:04:00.780> once<00:04:00.959> so

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
you're going to use them all at once so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.379 
you're going to use them all at once so
anyway<00:04:03.690> there's<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.620> explanation<00:04:05.389> thank
