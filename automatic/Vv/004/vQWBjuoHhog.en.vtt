with<00:06:33.509> what<00:06:33.660> followed<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.889> North<00:06:35.069> American

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
with what followed the North American

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.279 
with what followed the North American
song<00:06:35.639> is<00:06:35.880> actually<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.300> slower<00:06:36.630> version<00:06:36.750> of<00:06:37.169> the

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
song is actually a slower version of the

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.890 
song is actually a slower version of the
opening<00:06:37.650> song<00:06:37.860> sonic<00:06:38.400> boom<00:06:38.610> while<00:06:39.389> it<00:06:39.509> lacks<00:06:39.690> a

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
opening song sonic boom while it lacks a

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.480 
opening song sonic boom while it lacks a
lot<00:06:40.050> of<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.289> epicness<00:06:40.650> that<00:06:40.979> the<00:06:41.099> opening

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
lot of the epicness that the opening

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.370 
lot of the epicness that the opening
version<00:06:41.819> had<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.210> really<00:06:42.599> liked<00:06:42.840> they<00:06:43.050> added

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
version had I really liked they added

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.529 
version had I really liked they added
more<00:06:43.410> lyrics<00:06:43.949> and<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.550> like<00:06:44.759> the<00:06:44.880> broken<00:06:45.120> chords

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
more lyrics and I like the broken chords

in<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.690> acoustic<00:06:45.930> guitar<00:06:46.370> while<00:06:47.370> I<00:06:47.400> think<00:06:47.520> the

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
in the acoustic guitar while I think the

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.610 
in the acoustic guitar while I think the
Japanese<00:06:48.270> song<00:06:48.509> suits<00:06:48.810> the<00:06:48.960> ending<00:06:49.229> better<00:06:49.380> I

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
Japanese song suits the ending better I

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.260 
Japanese song suits the ending better I
think<00:06:50.039> the<00:06:50.130> North<00:06:50.340> American<00:06:50.789> one<00:06:50.910> is<00:06:51.030> a<00:06:51.060> better

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
think the North American one is a better

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.480 
think the North American one is a better
