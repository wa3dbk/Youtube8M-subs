00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 breadth i am family except honey brings a lot 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 various useful products one of them 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.330
 this propolis can be used in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:27.000
 raw as the gum and can be made from 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:29.939
 his tincture composition of propolis walks 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 about fifty sixty percent 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.510
 wood resin about 30 percent 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.850
 waxed so water can not dissolve 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.010
 propolis 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 propolis water infusion 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.890
 He is defective, not all substances that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 Propolis has five 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 can water can dissolve so i 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.989
 I make a tincture of propolis based 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.309
 sleeps by 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:10.320
 reduced by very good proofing 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:14.640
 pouring alcohol pure medical 400 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 grams from 300 grams 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:35.610
 recruit 2 and another 100 grams and the fact is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.610
 that medical alcohol 96 degrees can 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 dissolve some of the ingredients 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.380
 propolis to the point that they 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.420
 no longer have medicinal properties 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.009
 so in no case can you do 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.149
 tincture of pure medical alcohol 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.560
 pure medical alcohol 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.909
 should be divided in half with water 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.909
 optimal alcohol concentration 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.909
 applied 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.920
 It should be 63-65 degrees therefore 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 to 400 milliliters of alcohol I add 200 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:31.750
 milliliters of water here it can be like 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.090
 nails knowing any preferably not from 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.019
 plumbing preferably clean water here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 the reaction of water with alcohol went a little 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:47.340
 we got 600 milliliters I took 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.670
 more jar so that you can 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.700
 shake up then for 600 milliliters 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.900
 obtained alcohol solution to us 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.819
 need to take a tenth of propolis 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.130
 to get a ten percent tincture 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:13.510
 Propolis tenth is 60 grams 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:18.660
 we weigh propolis 61 we get 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.690
 I have propolis propolis as you can see 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:27.459
 crushed but it often happens that you 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.959
 get propolis or fresh that in 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.400
 best of all when he ties then he 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.780
 has properties like plasticine change 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.780
 its very hard 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.900
 it is necessary to take such propolis systems 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.180
 fresh put in the freezer for a few 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.990
 hours 23 5 hours so he froze then 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.310
 take a grater 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:02.040
 choose a grater like this nail 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.040
 punched and rubbed 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.390
 grater take what is not sorry most 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.420
 cheap because propolis stayed on 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:21.130
 grater and that will be very hard from here 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:24.010
 clean if you have propolis dry 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.470
 then no problem and you can run it 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.960
 grind chop 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:48.810
 or place the day like this 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:58.590
 crushed pour out take cover 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:58.590
 metal and roll up the jar lid 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.280
 Why do I want this whole thing first ? 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.270
 say use only glass then 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.800
 I prepare the tincture only cut 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.590
 Natalia can close the top plastic 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.020
 cover but the plastic will dissolve 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.110
 alcohol when shaking 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.620
 and substances from plastic can flow 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.009
 the resulting tincture is now possible 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.030
 shake up this jar as you like 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:53.259
 lid does not fly off alcohol does not leak 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:57.490
 everything works out very well this jar i 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:01.720
 I put together where I will constantly her 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:07.330
 see stumble upon this jar i 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:11.830
 I do to 5 6 8 times a day I 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.590
 her passport scrambled without such 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.099
 churning tincture of good not 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.099
 will turn out 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:27.690
 leave the jar at the passage 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:27.690
 corridor and not in the sun for 10 14 days 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:35.680
 after 10 14 days 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.240
 I take this tincture from me 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:45.000
 It turns out this and carefully 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:48.000
 poured into another glass jar 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 on top of 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.950
 and the sediment that remained below 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:10.140
 throwing away so much 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:13.970
 it turns out 10% propolis can 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:17.430
 also cook 20-30 percent but she 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.890
 most common and most 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:24.180
 effectively ten percent tincture 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:30.360
 propolis obtained tincture close 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:33.150
 cover and store a dark place what to do 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:38.130
 if alcohol tincture of propolis 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:41.190
 contraindicated you welcome it, I will show 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:45.260
 video link to which you will help 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.260
