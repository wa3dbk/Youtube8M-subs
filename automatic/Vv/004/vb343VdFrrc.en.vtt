00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.780
 let's play a game a game 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.699
 with the synchronicity a game with the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.930
 universal forces of causality 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'm looking at that for so long now 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.850
 Spiral until you come to a standstill 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.850
 is 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 us 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.950
 how do you feel only then can we 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.820
 Begin as I exaggerate I have to 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.710
 but try each other 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.500
 finally it is about to adjust 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.730
 same result 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.370
 But let's start with this card game 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.220
 Full of cards as they differ 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.780
 could not be 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.750
 and I also need a color 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.970
 Decide your decision as this 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.949
 a little hard is say we are you 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.739
 this coin is normal on one side 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.980
 on the other black we say 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.410
 black stands for black and this one 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.310
 So page for roth we look like 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.880
 you decide on red like 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.190
 delightful in our game is now 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.380
 why deduct from the top of cards couple 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.440
 they are different they are disposed of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 they are black, they are mine and according to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.429
 your decision is the red ones 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.740
 yours you have understood that 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.360
 that's nice 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 the goal of the game is at the end of the game 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.049
 to have the same number of cards and thus 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.210
 No one's manipulating us 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.909
 I blame the basic conditions 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.899
 the cards here on a very 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.220
 interesting but fair way 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.450
 and while I do this I still want to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 once point out that that 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.439
 experiment only works 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.619
 When you start on the spiral 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.990
 you did not do that 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.189
 then you can play now and do it 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.399
 make up for it when you are ready let us 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.399
 begin 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 since this may take a while now 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.039
 Maybe I'll tell the choice one 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:17.549
 joke, a woman comes to the doctor says 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:17.549
 Let's leave this music on board 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.569
 hmm i'm not sure but me 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.430
 think our result could be a little bit 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.049
 were unbalanced 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.810
 let's look at how many cards each one 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:40.310
 and we start with my 1 2 3 4 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.109
 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:50.989
 I have ten cards to check 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:53.150
 how much you have 123456 I think you 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.120
 cheated on the spiral friend 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.959
 blue but you know what I have me 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.959
 Almost thought 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.640
 Let's start a new attempt 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.069
 The cards mix again on mine 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.519
 great way 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.870
 actually you should do that and 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.939
 so our experiment this time 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.689
 actually want to work 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:24.480
 I ask you for a big favor 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:27.310
 in the spiral do it how are you feeling 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.950
 nice then decide now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.250
 once again for a color black or 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.250
 red 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.950
 black this time 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.040
 your decision 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 Let's go and save this time 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.780
 the jokes aperture equal to a little music 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 better 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.840
 This time I have a very good feeling 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.470
 if how is it with you let us 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.990
 look up 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.240
 we start again with my cards 1 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:31.670
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:33.260
 let's count yours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.910
 12 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.520
 Congrats Frank Lowy our experiment 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.870
 it worked 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.730
 oh yes and there is still a map 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.610
 now she should always remember that 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.960
 that our experiment already at the second 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.960
 tried
