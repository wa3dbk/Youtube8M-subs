internally illuminated and snow
plausible<00:00:16.199> raised<00:00:16.770> pavement<00:00:17.010> markers

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:35.490 

you

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:01:09.600 

can<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.590> wipe<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.220> one<00:00:37.340> off<00:00:37.460> real<00:00:37.670> quick

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.820 

so<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.120> what<00:01:11.690> is<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.930> one<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.770> is

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
so this is the what is this one this is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.430 
so this is the what is this one this is
the<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:13.100> that's<00:01:13.340> flush<00:01:13.790> with<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.780> top<00:01:14.810> this

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
the one that's flush with the top this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.630 
the one that's flush with the top this
is<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.650> kind<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.250> what<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.330> want<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:22.550> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
is the kind of the what we want so the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:02:10.770 
is the kind of the what we want so the
Rings<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.790> is<00:01:29.000> by<00:01:29.120> 2.5<00:01:29.480> millimeters
