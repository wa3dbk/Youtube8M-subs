a<00:00:19.890> square<00:00:20.340> side<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> angle<00:00:21.539> side

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
a square side on here in the angle side

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.269 
a square side on here in the angle side
like<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> low<00:00:22.529> side<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
like this with the low side here this is

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.529 
like this with the low side here this is
where<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> next<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> attach<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
where the next going to attach on the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.529 
where the next going to attach on the
guitar<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> tenon<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> neck<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
guitar so the tenon from the neck is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.560 
guitar so the tenon from the neck is
going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> fit<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.439> slot<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.269> cut

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
going to fit into a slot here so I cut

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.810 
going to fit into a slot here so I cut
this<00:00:30.750> slot<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.009> three<00:00:32.279> quarter<00:00:32.550> inch

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
this slot in and it's three quarter inch

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.950 
this slot in and it's three quarter inch
wide<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.300> math<00:00:33.480> 10<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:35.000> about<00:00:36.000> an<00:00:36.090> inch<00:00:36.180> inch

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
wide to math 10 and about an inch inch

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
wide to math 10 and about an inch inch
deep<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> keep<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> 10

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
deep I'm going to keep them on the 10

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110 
deep I'm going to keep them on the 10
theoretically<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.480> 15<00:00:39.840> 16<00:00:40.760> deep<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.030> you

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
theoretically it's 15 16 deep so you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
theoretically it's 15 16 deep so you
made<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.570> inch<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> little<00:00:43.260> bit

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
made this one inch to make a little bit

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.450 
made this one inch to make a little bit
just<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.920> longer<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
just a little bit longer because you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
just a little bit longer because you
don't<00:00:44.670> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> tend<00:00:45.180> bang<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> back<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
don't want to tend bang on the back of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
don't want to tend bang on the back of
the<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> tight<00:00:47.489> fit<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the thing or go get a tight fit so I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
the thing or go get a tight fit so I
this<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.450> deeper<00:00:48.690> than<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.930> 10<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.789> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
this little deeper than your 10 I just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.220 
this little deeper than your 10 I just
run<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> ruin<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> table<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.110> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
run this ruin the table so I like that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.080 
run this ruin the table so I like that
cut<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> do

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because this is upside down the top of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
because this is upside down the top of
the<00:00:56.820> guitar<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> back<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> guitar<00:00:58.050> the

ok so I'm takin the head block and I've
drilled<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.860> couple<00:01:56.130> holes<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.670> because

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
drilled a couple holes in it because

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.720 
drilled a couple holes in it because
we're<00:01:56.970> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.300> use<00:01:57.480> these<00:01:57.750> bolts

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
we're going to use these bolts

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.040 
we're going to use these bolts
eventually<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.850> whole<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.120> neck<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
eventually the whole the neck on and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.010 
eventually the whole the neck on and
then<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.230> on<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:02.150> like<00:02:03.150> so<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:05.310> mean<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.300> the

then go on here like so I mean and the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
then go on here like so I mean and the
holes<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.500> drill<00:02:07.770> buddy<00:02:08.369> using<00:02:08.670> make<00:02:08.880> them<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
holes you drill buddy using make them a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120 
holes you drill buddy using make them a
little<00:02:09.119> bit<00:02:09.330> sloppy<00:02:09.600> because<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> comes

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
little bit sloppy because when it comes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.680 
little bit sloppy because when it comes
time<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.400> align<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.030> neck<00:02:12.300> you're<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
time to align that neck you're going to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
time to align that neck you're going to
be<00:02:12.780> welcoming<00:02:13.170> you're<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.680> happy

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
get this lined up in the nut so I'll

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.070 
get this lined up in the nut so I'll
drill<00:02:19.290> those<00:02:19.440> holes<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.660> just<00:02:21.660> try

drill those holes in there and just try

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.979 
drill those holes in there and just try
and<00:02:22.140> space<00:02:22.470> them<00:02:22.680> out<00:02:22.830> relatively<00:02:23.840> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> as

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
and space them out relatively kind of as

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.270 
and space them out relatively kind of as
far<00:02:25.200> apart<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.739> get<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:25.980> owing<00:02:26.220> you

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
far apart as you can get them owing you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.330 
far apart as you can get them owing you
too<00:02:26.550> close<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> edge<00:02:27.120> they<00:02:27.450> might<00:02:27.630> split

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
too close to the edge they might split

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.740 
too close to the edge they might split
I'm<00:02:29.340> gonna<00:02:29.489> split<00:02:29.790> anything<00:02:30.209> or<00:02:30.450> especially

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I'm gonna split anything or especially

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.900 
I'm gonna split anything or especially
today<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.410> nuts<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:31.950> into<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.280> hip<00:02:32.489> into

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
today the nuts that go into the hip into

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.790 
today the nuts that go into the hip into
the<00:02:33.560> into<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> neck<00:02:34.890> won't<00:02:35.100> split<00:02:35.459> here<00:02:36.800> so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
the into the neck won't split here so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250 
the into the neck won't split here so
that's<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.310> glued<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:39.020> flat<00:02:40.020> side

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that's going to get glued on flat side

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560 
that's going to get glued on flat side
down<00:02:40.290> with<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.800> truss<00:02:40.980> rod<00:02:41.190> access<00:02:41.640> down<00:02:42.420> on

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
down with the truss rod access down on

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.710 
down with the truss rod access down on
the<00:02:42.660> soundboard<00:02:43.489> like<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the soundboard like that there we go and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.070 
the soundboard like that there we go and
aligned<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:47.600> accurately<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.900> can

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
aligned as accurately as you can

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750 
aligned as accurately as you can
possibly<00:02:49.260> get<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> line<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.520> drew

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
possibly get it to that line you drew

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:05.980 
possibly get it to that line you drew
where<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> go

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:19.840 

it's<00:03:06.530> not<00:03:06.680> enough

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.640 

that's<00:03:20.510> too<00:03:20.660> much

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
that's too much

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:34.520 
that's too much

all you need is one clamp on this table

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.680 
all you need is one clamp on this table
level<00:04:52.700> when<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.880> guy<00:04:52.970> says<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:53.330> only<00:04:53.420> need

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
level when the guy says you only need

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.210

one<00:04:53.840> clamp<00:04:54.170> on<00:04:54.380> this<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.770> he<00:04:54.860> turns<00:04:55.070> around

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
one clamp on this and he turns around

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.810 
one clamp on this and he turns around
puts<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.520> second<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.000> one<00:04:57.190> now<00:04:58.190> sometimes<00:04:58.700> is

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
puts a second and one now sometimes is

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.780 
puts a second and one now sometimes is
easier<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.300> keep<00:04:59.540> it<00:04:59.750> from<00:04:59.990> moving<00:05:00.430> if<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.670> got

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
easier to keep it from moving if you got

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:10.360 
easier to keep it from moving if you got
to<00:05:01.880> clients<00:05:02.270> balance<00:05:02.720> on<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> two<00:05:03.140> sides<00:05:09.370> now

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
to clients balance on the two sides now

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.090 
to clients balance on the two sides now
you'll<00:05:10.700> find<00:05:11.140> it'll<00:05:12.140> just<00:05:12.440> itself<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.980> little

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
you'll find it'll just itself a little

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.060 
you'll find it'll just itself a little
bit<00:05:14.200> coax<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:15.440> back<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:16.010> place<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:18.770> get<00:05:18.950> the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
bit coax it back in place you get the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.620 
bit coax it back in place you get the
class<00:05:19.280> pick<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.880> you<00:05:19.910> kind<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.180> got<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> nurse

class pick and you kind of got a nurse

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:30.670 
class pick and you kind of got a nurse
this<00:05:20.870> one

everything else with the neck you don't

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.590

should run in the tail block of guitar

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.460 
should run in the tail block of guitar
some<00:06:28.820> people<00:06:29.120> say<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.389> should<00:06:29.539> run<00:06:29.780> up<00:06:30.259> and
