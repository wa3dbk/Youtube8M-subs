00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.497
The thirth generation Renault Scenic came out in 2009, so it's time for the facelift. 

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:21.283
Or, as Renault call it: Phase Deux. 

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:28.219
The usual list of course: new headlights, new front, strips, taillights, you know.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:34.409
But also new A-pillars that look faster.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:40.621
On the inside you'll get some new details as well. 

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:47.913
The TFT-screen is new. You can change the colors an configuration. 

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:56.073
Fun for gadget freaks, but I prefer analogue instruments in front of me. 

00:00:56.416 --> 00:01:03.141
There's Bose hifi with aux and usb connectors. 

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:12.455
And there's Air Quality Sensor. It checks the air quality outside. 

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:20.798
If it's bad, as in cities like *** or ***, you get a dirty cloud.

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:27.446
And here in the coutry, where it smells like cow shit, you get a leaf. 

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:33.097
A funny gadget, but since it doesn't close the ventilation, rather useless. 

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:40.248
This car has the Visio-package, with lane departure warning and headlight assist. 

00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:46.998
More important are the new engines. There are 4 different ones. 

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:54.996
2 diesel and 2 petrol. I'm driving the smallest diesel with 110 HP. 

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:13.000
It has 260 Nm, 20 more as the old one. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.818
It is more fuel efficient. Does it feel like that? Not at all. 

00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:27.720
From 1.750 rpm you get maximum torque, and at 1.500 there's already 80 percent available. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.353
Even at low REV's, you get along fine. 

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:38.372
IT sounds and feels a but rough, though, like most of the time with small diesels. 

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:40.331
But you probably get used to that. 

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:47.209
And then again, it is powerful enough. 

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:54.308
As before, you can chose from Scenic and Grand Scenic, which I'm driving now. 

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:58.300
This is a 5-seater, but there's also a 7-seater. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.786
The interiour is quite flexible, although Opel does that better. 

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:08.809
The seats can slide to the front, but not sidewards. 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:14.743
But the whole seat can be collapsed to create maximum loading space. 

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:21.223
There's also a 130 HP diesel, but I think this one is just fine. 

00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:24.960
Renault can be happy with this renewed Scenic. It's an important car in this class. 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:37.221
Since the Scenic came, cack in 1996, the competition has grown a lot with the Touran, C-Mac and C4. 

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:40.668
The Ford and CitroÃ«n both are available with long wheelbase as well. 

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:47.306
I think that with this facelift Renault will keep the pole position in this segment. 

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:54.281
+ Interiour
+ Torque at low REVs
- Sounds rough
- Artificial steering
