simple<00:01:44.759> tests<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.189> might

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
simple tests that to see if we might

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.130 
simple tests that to see if we might
give<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> come<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> prescription<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
give a come up with a prescription that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
give a come up with a prescription that
their<00:01:49.829> doctors<00:01:50.220> didn't<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.450> help

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
their doctors didn't think of to help

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.980 
their doctors didn't think of to help
them<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:52.350> better<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.399> short<00:01:53.430> term<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
them get better in the short term and so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.209 
them get better in the short term and so
we<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:56.009> proceeded<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.450> our<00:01:57.810> simple<00:01:58.799> exam

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
we then proceeded to do our simple exam

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.520 
we then proceeded to do our simple exam
and<00:01:59.549> i'm<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> start<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.350> first

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and i'm going to start and the first

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
and i'm going to start and the first
thing<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.890> tell<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> we're<00:02:03.360> sure

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
thing we tell them is that we're sure

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.840 
thing we tell them is that we're sure
the<00:02:03.780> nurses<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.320> their<00:02:04.500> 10

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the nurses take their 10

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.660 
the nurses take their 10
to<00:02:05.000> regularly<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:06.439> find<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.130> sometimes

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
to regularly and we find that sometimes

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.309 
to regularly and we find that sometimes
the<00:02:08.000> temperature<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:09.050> give<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
the temperature can really give you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.070 
the temperature can really give you
clues<00:02:09.649> as<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.069> what<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> problem<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.480> so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
clues as to what the problem is and so
