00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
but unfortunately it wasn't a nuketown

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
but unfortunately it wasn't a nuketown
because<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> few<00:00:36.300> kills<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
because I got a few kills with the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
because I got a few kills with the
sentry<00:00:37.590> gun<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> still<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.399> got

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
sentry gun but I still think I've got

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
sentry gun but I still think I've got
like<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> 26<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.629> 27<00:00:39.960> gun<00:00:40.379> streak<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.829> have

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
like a 26 or 27 gun streak or what have

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799 
like a 26 or 27 gun streak or what have
you<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.850> sentry<00:00:42.120> gun<00:00:42.149> wasn't<00:00:42.600> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you because the sentry gun wasn't that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
you because the sentry gun wasn't that
um<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.829> wasn't<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.219> effective<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:44.969> more

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
um it wasn't that effective it was more

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
um it wasn't that effective it was more
of<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.649> hard<00:00:46.649> -<00:00:46.739> no<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.190> -<00:00:47.370> humor<00:00:47.700> me

I<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.180> using<00:00:48.500> kill<00:00:49.500> streaks<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:49.920> score

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I like using kill streaks or score

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
I like using kill streaks or score

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
EMP my score streaks but fortunately for

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929 
EMP my score streaks but fortunately for
me<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.960> didn't<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.770> had<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
me they didn't and I had a good time and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
me they didn't and I had a good time and
his<00:01:27.060> gameplay<00:01:27.240> he<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.930> been<00:01:28.049> nice<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
his gameplay he would have been nice to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399 
his gameplay he would have been nice to
see<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.579> gotten<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.170> nukes

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
see if I could have gotten the the nukes

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.399 
see if I could have gotten the the nukes
out<00:01:31.590> without<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> visa<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.060> EMP<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:34.320> with

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
out without a visa or an EMP just with

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
out without a visa or an EMP just with
the<00:01:34.470> UAV<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.130> obviously<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.640> close<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the UAV because obviously I was close to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
the UAV because obviously I was close to
not<00:01:36.210> dying<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> entire<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.740> my

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
not dying the entire time but this is my

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
not dying the entire time but this is my
tactic<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> parts

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
tactic you can see I'm one of the parts

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.240 
tactic you can see I'm one of the parts
of<00:01:40.110> buildings<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> main<00:01:40.860> buildings

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of buildings one of the main buildings

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
of buildings one of the main buildings
on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> map<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.880> decided<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> put<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> guardian

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
on the map I decided to put a guardian

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
on the map I decided to put a guardian
up<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.320> protect<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.979> entryways<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
up to protect the entryways up to the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
up to protect the entryways up to the
top<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> roof<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.399> guess<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
top or the roof I guess of one of the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
top or the roof I guess of one of the
main<00:01:48.180> buildings<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.110> threw<00:01:49.320> down<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.500> sentry

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
main buildings and I threw down a sentry

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
main buildings and I threw down a sentry
gun<00:01:50.040> -<00:01:50.159> where<00:01:50.369> people<00:01:50.579> overlook<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
gun - where people overlook the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
gun - where people overlook the
overlooks<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> middle<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.619> gets<00:01:52.799> like

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
overlooks the middle and it gets like

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.170 
overlooks the middle and it gets like
three<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.220> four<00:01:53.250> kills<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> wasn't<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
three or four kills it wasn't that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.770 
three or four kills it wasn't that
amazing

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
amazing

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
amazing
but<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.259> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> funny<00:01:55.770> trying<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> set

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
but it was kind of funny trying to set

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.459 
but it was kind of funny trying to set
it<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.610> watching<00:01:56.909> people<00:01:57.210> getting<00:01:58.110> melted

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it up and watching people getting melted

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.590 
it up and watching people getting melted
I<00:01:58.710> guess<00:01:58.920> by<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> guardian<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.509> there

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I guess by a guardian and I think there

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.819 
I guess by a guardian and I think there
was<00:02:00.689> only<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.960> personally<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> Tingler<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
was only one personally the Tingler is

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.109 
was only one personally the Tingler is
trying<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> take<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.060> he

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
trying to take them out and it was he

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
trying to take them out and it was he
stood<00:02:03.390> he<00:02:03.840> must<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> engineer

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
stood he must have had to engineer

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
stood he must have had to engineer
around<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.130> he<00:02:05.219> stood<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:05.790> underneath

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
around because he stood here underneath

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
around because he stood here underneath
Thurman<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.229> shot<00:02:07.409> through<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> ceiling

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
Thurman he just shot through the ceiling

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.859 
Thurman he just shot through the ceiling
they<00:02:08.879> managed<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> take<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.690> homes

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
they managed to take one of them homes

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
they managed to take one of them homes
which<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.590> annoying<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.160> apart

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
which was kind of annoying but apart

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.759 
which was kind of annoying but apart
from<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> gameplay<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
from that that was the gameplay and the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.170 
from that that was the gameplay and the
title<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.220> video<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.700> IT<00:02:14.819> bug

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
title in this video look at that IT bug

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.449 
title in this video look at that IT bug
him<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.660> he<00:02:15.750> destroyed<00:02:16.319> must<00:02:16.500> destroy<00:02:17.280> my

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
him because he destroyed must destroy my

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
him because he destroyed must destroy my
scorestreaks<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.120> thought<00:02:18.780> he<00:02:18.930> deserved<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
scorestreaks I thought he deserved the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.020 
scorestreaks I thought he deserved the
the<00:02:19.709> good<00:02:19.830> old<00:02:19.980> tea<00:02:20.160> bag<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.580> won<00:02:20.700> two<00:02:20.879> tea

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the good old tea bag that won two tea

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.000 
the good old tea bag that won two tea
bags<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.540> anyway<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> title<00:02:22.530> video<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> going

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
bags so anyway the title video is going

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.500 
bags so anyway the title video is going
to<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.220> something<00:02:23.430> along<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> lines<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.269> I
