going to continue where we're at I know
how<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> do<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.480> level<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.620> reason<00:00:13.980> why

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
how to do this level and the reason why

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
how to do this level and the reason why
I<00:00:14.130> didn't<00:00:14.549> know<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I didn't know what to do is because I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250 
I didn't know what to do is because I
didn't<00:00:17.190> take<00:00:17.670> into<00:00:17.910> account<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.930> thing

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
didn't take into account that thing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.740 
didn't take into account that thing
right<00:00:19.470> there<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:21.060> soon<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> take<00:00:21.570> into

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
right there and as soon as you take into

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950 
right there and as soon as you take into
account<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.970> this<00:00:23.970> level<00:00:24.330> becomes<00:00:24.510> very

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
account that this level becomes very

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
account that this level becomes very
easy<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.150> both<00:00:27.449> things<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.900> over

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
easy as you can see both things are over

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.429 
easy as you can see both things are over
there<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.570> matter<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.349> time

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have to do the next part here so the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.100 
have to do the next part here so the
next<00:01:23.909> part<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.720> easy<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
next part is actually really easy you

next part is actually really easy you
just<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.680> take<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.159> account<00:01:26.430> angles

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
just have to take into account angles

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.100 
just have to take into account angles
and<00:01:28.130> we're<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.250> math<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.329> or<00:01:30.780> in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and we're doing math right now or in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.179 
and we're doing math right now or in
math<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:31.860> been<00:01:32.610> grade<00:01:32.820> 11<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.189> we're

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
math right now been grade 11 and we're

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.750 
math right now been grade 11 and we're
taking<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.869> coast<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.100> cosine<00:01:38.579> line

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
taking it's like coast so cosine line

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.000 
taking it's like coast so cosine line
basically<00:01:40.570> has<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.840> do<00:01:40.960> with<00:01:41.050> writing<00:01:41.230> all

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
basically has to do with writing all

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.700 
basically has to do with writing all
shut<00:01:42.250> up<00:01:42.370> for<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.580> second<00:01:42.910> tell<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.660> what<00:01:43.900> let's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the way if you guys are wondering this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.590 
the way if you guys are wondering this
is<00:02:44.540> chapter<00:02:45.050> four<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.819> don't<00:02:46.819> know<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.450> guys

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
is chapter four I don't know if you guys

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.470 
is chapter four I don't know if you guys
knew<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:49.180> well<00:02:50.290> yeah<00:02:52.090> comedy<00:02:53.090> equals

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
knew that well yeah comedy equals

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.380 
knew that well yeah comedy equals
tragedy<00:02:54.080> plus<00:02:54.410> time<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.819> have<00:02:56.060> been

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
tragedy plus time and you have been

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.420 
tragedy plus time and you have been
asleep<00:02:56.630> for<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.080> while<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.069> guess<00:02:58.400> it's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
asleep for a while so I guess it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.910 
asleep for a while so I guess it's
actually<00:02:59.330> pretty<00:02:59.600> funny<00:03:00.140> when<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.620> do<00:03:00.799> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
actually pretty funny when we do the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.280 
actually pretty funny when we do the
math

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.300 

alright<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.730> one<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:10.450> basically<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.469> mix

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
alright so this one it's basically a mix

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.069 
alright so this one it's basically a mix
between<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.730> momentum<00:03:13.299> puzzle<00:03:13.659> and<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> laser

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
between a momentum puzzle and a laser

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.000 
between a momentum puzzle and a laser
puzzle<00:03:15.030> pretty<00:03:16.030> straightforward<00:03:16.379> as<00:03:17.379> far<00:03:17.829> as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
puzzle pretty straightforward as far as

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.490 
puzzle pretty straightforward as far as
the<00:03:18.129> laser<00:03:18.370> puzzle<00:03:18.879> goes<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.480> bit<00:03:20.019> trickier

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
the laser puzzle goes a bit trickier

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.520 
the laser puzzle goes a bit trickier
when<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.739> comes<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> little<00:03:21.189> memento

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
when it comes to a little memento

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.720 
when it comes to a little memento
basically<00:03:23.530> um<00:03:26.040> how<00:03:27.040> can<00:03:27.129> I<00:03:27.310> explain<00:03:27.489> this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
basically um how can I explain this

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.520 
basically um how can I explain this
you'll<00:03:30.730> see<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.900> use<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.260> momentum

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you'll see but to use the momentum

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.890 
you'll see but to use the momentum
properly<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.359> use<00:03:34.569> one<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.780> those

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
properly you have to use one of those

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.390 
properly you have to use one of those
launcher<00:03:35.439> things<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.920> we've<00:03:36.040> used<00:03:36.220> before

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
launcher things that we've used before

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.879 
launcher things that we've used before
and<00:03:36.760> it's<00:03:37.510> one<00:03:37.900> say<00:03:38.139> it's<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.409> easiest<00:03:38.769> thing

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
and it's one say it's the easiest thing

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.410 
and it's one say it's the easiest thing
but<00:03:39.549> there's<00:03:39.700> definitely<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.150> lot<00:03:40.359> harder

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
but there's definitely a lot harder

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.569 
but there's definitely a lot harder
things<00:03:41.019> in<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.319> game<00:03:41.530> especially<00:03:42.340> when<00:03:42.430> you

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
things in this game especially when you

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.750 
things in this game especially when you
get<00:03:42.730> new<00:03:42.879> about<00:03:43.409> chapter<00:03:44.409> six<00:03:44.920> or<00:03:45.099> seven<00:03:45.489> and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
get new about chapter six or seven and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.629 
get new about chapter six or seven and
you<00:03:46.150> get<00:03:46.269> into<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> goos<00:03:47.189> if<00:03:48.189> you<00:03:48.340> didn't<00:03:48.549> know

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
you get into the goos if you didn't know

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:59.309 
you get into the goos if you didn't know
that<00:03:48.849> sorry<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.510> yeah<00:03:54.329> there<00:03:55.329> we<00:03:55.450> go<00:03:57.599> whoo<00:03:58.599> and

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
that sorry but yeah there we go whoo and

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.869 
that sorry but yeah there we go whoo and
now<00:03:59.769> I<00:03:59.799> just<00:03:59.919> have<00:04:00.129> to<00:04:00.250> do<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.430> same<00:04:00.609> thing

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
now I just have to do the same thing

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.540 
now I just have to do the same thing
with<00:04:01.000> me

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.000 

and<00:04:04.210> where<00:04:04.510> am<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.630> going<00:04:04.810> let's<00:04:05.650> see<00:04:05.770> if<00:04:05.830> we<00:04:05.920> can

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and where am I going let's see if we can

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.610 
and where am I going let's see if we can
get<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.840> fail<00:04:09.660> tried<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.750> get<00:04:10.900> an<00:04:11.050> all<00:04:11.230> in<00:04:11.590> one

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
get it fail tried to get an all in one

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.530 
get it fail tried to get an all in one
jump<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.370> failed<00:04:12.700> miserably<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:15.390> just<00:04:16.390> get

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
jump but I failed miserably I just get

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.040 
jump but I failed miserably I just get
lost<00:04:16.810> while<00:04:17.320> I'm<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.680> air<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:22.020> wonder<00:04:23.020> like

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
lost while I'm in the air I wonder like

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.960 
lost while I'm in the air I wonder like
how<00:04:23.290> much<00:04:23.680> programming<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.550> would<00:04:24.640> take<00:04:24.820> to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
how much programming it would take to

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.380 
how much programming it would take to
they<00:04:25.150> make<00:04:25.570> this<00:04:25.780> engine<00:04:26.650> because<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.340> mean<00:04:28.150> I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
they make this engine because I mean I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.360 
they make this engine because I mean I
guess<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:29.050> same<00:04:29.260> as<00:04:29.380> any<00:04:29.620> other<00:04:29.740> engine<00:04:30.190> but

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
guess the same as any other engine but

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.490 
guess the same as any other engine but
like<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:31.270> portal<00:04:31.810> thing<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.260> would<00:04:32.380> like

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
like the portal thing that would like

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.220 
like the portal thing that would like
screw<00:04:33.490> me<00:04:33.640> up<00:04:33.670> if<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.060> was<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> game<00:04:34.450> developer<00:04:34.660> I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
screw me up if I was a game developer I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.350 
screw me up if I was a game developer I
don't<00:04:35.380> know<00:04:35.440> if<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.590> guys<00:04:35.710> know<00:04:35.920> what<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.070> mean

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
don't know if you guys know what I mean

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.180 
don't know if you guys know what I mean
but<00:04:37.360> uh<00:04:38.850> yeah<00:04:40.500> actually<00:04:41.500> we're<00:04:41.830> gonna<00:04:41.920> do<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
but uh yeah actually we're gonna do the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.050 
but uh yeah actually we're gonna do the
same<00:04:42.340> thing<00:04:42.550> as<00:04:42.670> last<00:04:42.700> time<00:04:43.030> cuz<00:04:43.780> we<00:04:43.930> gotta<00:04:44.110> get

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
same thing as last time cuz we gotta get

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.310 
same thing as last time cuz we gotta get
this<00:04:46.060> down<00:04:48.090> should<00:04:49.090> work<00:04:49.330> boom<00:04:50.050> oh<00:04:52.230> there<00:04:53.230> it

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
this down should work boom oh there it

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.520 
this down should work boom oh there it
is<00:04:54.690> if<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:55.780> didn't<00:04:55.930> see<00:04:56.050> what<00:04:56.170> i<00:04:56.200> did<00:04:56.260> there<00:04:56.380> I

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
is if you didn't see what i did there I

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.200 
is if you didn't see what i did there I
just<00:04:56.620> knock<00:04:56.980> this<00:04:57.280> thing<00:04:57.340> off<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.730> pedestal<00:04:59.190> too

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
just knock this thing off a pedestal too

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.350

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.850 

I<00:05:35.100> thought<00:05:36.090> about<00:05:36.240> our<00:05:36.420> dilemma<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.200> I<00:05:37.620> came

I thought about our dilemma and I came

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.950 
I thought about our dilemma and I came
up<00:05:38.040> with<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.250> solution<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.940> I<00:05:39.120> honestly<00:05:39.360> think

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
up with a solution that I honestly think

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.400 
up with a solution that I honestly think
works<00:05:40.260> out<00:05:40.470> best<00:05:40.740> for<00:05:41.040> one<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.340> both<00:05:41.550> of<00:05:41.580> us

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410

okay<00:05:43.410> I<00:05:43.800> wonder<00:05:44.250> what<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.520> solution<00:05:45.000> is

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
okay I wonder what that solution is

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.859 
okay I wonder what that solution is
