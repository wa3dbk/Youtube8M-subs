00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
the time to do L catch a redeem the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.979 
the time to do L catch a redeem the
coupon<00:03:23.410> yeah<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:24.940> 3,000<00:03:25.600> feet<00:03:25.750> high

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.050 
coupon yeah and so it's 3,000 feet high
it<00:03:26.230> took<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.620> about<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.920> week<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.610> when<00:03:27.940> you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
it took you about a week and when you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
finally got to the top I guess it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.470 
finally got to the top I guess it
normally<00:03:30.100> takes<00:03:30.370> four<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.610> six<00:03:30.910> days<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.330> that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
normally takes four to six days so that

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.610 
to the top and what was that like for
you<00:03:35.590> Sean<00:03:36.299> G<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.750> whole<00:03:37.930> thing's<00:03:38.200> kind<00:03:38.440> of

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
you Sean G the whole thing's kind of

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.820 
you Sean G the whole thing's kind of
overwhelming<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> last<00:03:39.610> day<00:03:40.019> we<00:03:41.019> had<00:03:41.260> storm

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
and reach the top so we wouldn't be

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.229
