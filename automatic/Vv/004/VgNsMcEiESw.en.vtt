00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.860
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.860
 video tutorials tv 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.400
 in this video you will learn how to 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 solve the problem that your 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.680
 computer does not detect the sd card or 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.040
 any type of device 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 of memory 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.540
 here in my file browser you can 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 see how my computer does not detect the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.850
 sd card that I have inserted now 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.990
 same and to solve this problem what 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.990
 only you have to do 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.860
 he chose the lower left corner 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.840
 give you a right click and you will enter the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 device manager once 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 here what you have to do is enter 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.670
 in the submenu of bus controllers 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670
 it would be universal 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.220
 and since you have many options and 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.850
 only ones that are going to interest us are these 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.520
 two USB storage device 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.000
 to you they may appear more 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.070
 usb storage devices to me 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.700
 As you can see I see two but 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 you can show 13 or 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.840
 Now what you have to do will be 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.630
 go testing in each of the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.570
 devices what you have to do in 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.610
 each of them will click 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 right and you give it to disable 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 here I will ask you give a continuation 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.660
 if once you are loaded here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 icon will change and you can see that it is 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.580
 uninhabited what you have to do will be 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.320
 give you right click again and 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.040
 enable it in such a way 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.530
 and the removable disk will be activated as 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.510
 you can see here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.610
 in this case the disc appears 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.299
 removable but it does not give me the option of 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.670
 enter to see the files that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.090
 contain well see it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.280
 what I will do next will be repeat 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.849
 the same sequence with the other 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.880
 device is to say right click 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.250
 disable confirm we hope that 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.830
 load 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.840
 we give you right click again and open 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.440
 now we wait for that refreshment 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.350
 in my case he has given me money again 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.319
 then what I will do next will be 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.230
 take out of the oven 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.250
 the song that's 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.920
 and put it back 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.220
 and once this is done in this case it has 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.430
 detected sd memory 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.330
 As you can see here you can see all 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.520
 the files that contain 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.210
