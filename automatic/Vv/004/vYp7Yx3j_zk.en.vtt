00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.220
 we have one big project called 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.929
 plant design vial that is here and she 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.540
 so let's say harare industry 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.269
 which includes ecology 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.849
 the percentage of those who steal the design is not 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:18.960
 know how 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.500
 and all this pleases take the money for 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.400
 place 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 here is the price of the community around 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.679
 vial have events 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.309
 along with the fact that the structure is 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.539
 service which represents 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.640
 close proximity factory 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.610
 tenge Strovsky class 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.260
 that is, I am describing this assessment 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 customs officers 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.129
 these are all those that they are people involved in 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 and not media start-up projects with principle 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 any sphere anyway involved 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.890
 creativity but they are united first and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.260
 thanks to this we create new ones 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.660
 projects tested them 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470
 our playground become first of all it 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.130
 with seasonal festivals 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.840
 Farmers Market Festival from Sizo to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.650
 sites are our own projects 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.370
 small things whole bada 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.870
 i mean i 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.030
 and which can in every way 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 realized exhibition jsc 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 anthony stakes and lectures m in general very 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.850
 lot 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.490
 red directivity 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.329
 and in the plus to the bottom it is large of course 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.990
 percent brands 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.570
 such as right so the idea was born 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 site we have from the site where he 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.719
 platforms 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.109
 so here's the actual work on 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.420
 constant such basis 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330
 on different projects 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.630
 he is very different directions 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.140
 on the site of the plant however 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 relive startups action bounce 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.620
 directions of development 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.470
 creative nonprofit 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.950
 events partner 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.300
 events that interest us 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.760
 and at the site of which stood selling torture 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.859
 activity 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.580
 November bribe for 5 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.530
 but including it beats some 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.780
 activity 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 but in general there are also long term rentals. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.169
 this is showrooms 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.559
 design bureau architect who 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.659
 no permanent chairmen and work 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.189
 The process can be said about he number of our 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.489
 regular customers 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.180
 and since in 7th place it is again 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 to create a project platform for 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.639
 imitations of startups 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.259
 in the field they are together this creative 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.029
 industries 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.479
 and this is directly from the ranks 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.709
 which dwells around the vials and 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.740
 which 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.520
 come constantly he grew 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040
 with which at the same time projects and projects 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.080
 which they come to us in principle 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.939
 connected one way or another platform 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.729
 and you fashion trends 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.359
 compiling trends 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.279
 she is 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.450
 21.12 16 per annum 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.760
 there 30 years old for example the introduction of the standard 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 minded 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.469
 outstanding experiment 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.099
 to fray the project has several 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.489
 interest in us 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.549
 we give ground for realization 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.259
 and realizing projects 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.269
 that is, and even the important spaces that 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.699
 develop on 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.759
 operation 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.299
 so does not seem to pull on everyone has their own mission 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.219
 here we chose not all of it 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.459
 such a grouping 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.239
 by effects 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.749
 creative promotion industries and praise 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:31.909
 a life 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.469
 every enterprise built is interesting and 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.500
 unusually 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.470
 Chicagoans have to fight the Chinese 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.129
 Koreans standards 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.879
 percentage but it can be noted 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.549
 the exhibition is a very significant project 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.089
 did our portal it's not so scary 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:48.989
 which is now all three months in composition 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.249
 And the management team design the plant flacon

 and the prize weighs and here it is 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.059
 space with a search of 350 meters 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.039
 this exhibition was held rook not 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.219

 exhibition mission california 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.049
 really not seeing at all 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.039
 future 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.239
 photographer n 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.549
 who perceives the world 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.090
 some kind of other mastering yes here's how 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.710
 about 5 5 session with the object of envy 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.580
 worm 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.129
 opportunities perceived i don't 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.139
 knew embody 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.729
 was to present the soul at the exhibition 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.059
 interesting project 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.639
 hirohisa their descendants who conducted 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.219
 photography workshops related 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.459
 with the dawn but why almost 300 projects 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.180
 a couple of development a lot in general 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.949
 direction selected 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.080
 and this fact social projects 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.349
 these are projects 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.180
 these are projects in the field 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.370
 Belgium 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.330
 we have it 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 sowed court 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.650
 JSC Quartz Pavlodar 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.509
 creative 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.920
 stealing money that comes here 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.689
 and they have a draft court 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.139
 and we are trying and coordinating 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.300
 communicate 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.439
 and bring to life 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.619
 and basically this water is somewhat 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:20.749
 directions that we move there 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.279
 cottage projects exist outside 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.400
 vial 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.740
 but these are our partnership projects 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.030
 and in principle, yes, the resources that we 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.650
 can give your body 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.599
 and in this area resources and 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.080
 consequence 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.819
 just give 6 5 6 5 does not depend uah we are ready 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.439
 of course he 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.069
 in particular by the project 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.419
 and percentage 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.979
 ready to cooperate with the investigation 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.699
 so if creative industries
