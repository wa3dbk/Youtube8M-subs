it<00:02:22.709> could<00:02:22.829> also<00:02:22.950> adjust<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> light<00:02:23.819> duration

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.390 
it could also adjust the light duration
which<00:02:25.140> means<00:02:25.379> how<00:02:25.620> long<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.189> in<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
which means how long is it like in a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
which means how long is it like in a
flash<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> notification<00:02:27.780> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
flash when you get the notification I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.179 
flash when you get the notification I
have<00:02:28.019> mine<00:02:28.170> set<00:02:28.409> for<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.739> do<00:02:29.159> not

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
have mine set for it do not

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.770 
have mine set for it do not
automatically<00:02:29.790> switch<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.269> it'll<00:02:30.510> switch

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
automatically switch off it'll switch

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.630

off<00:02:30.959> once<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.650> look<00:02:31.829> at<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.250> think<00:02:32.489> that's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
off once you look at it I think that's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.800 
off once you look at it I think that's
the<00:02:32.700> best<00:02:32.849> way<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.299> about<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the best way to go about it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.140 
the best way to go about it
you've<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.560> LED<00:02:34.709> flash<00:02:35.220> rate<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.000> can

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you've got the LED flash rate you can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.149 
you've got the LED flash rate you can
adjust<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:36.810> quickly<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.439> flashes<00:02:37.829> which<00:02:38.010> is

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
adjust how quickly it flashes which is

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.220 
adjust how quickly it flashes which is
also<00:02:38.430> pretty<00:02:38.790> cool<00:02:38.939> I've<00:02:39.480> got<00:02:39.720> mine<00:02:39.900> set<00:02:40.079> too

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
also pretty cool I've got mine set too

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.619 
also pretty cool I've got mine set too
fast<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.159> default<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.819> just

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
fast because the default way is just

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.229 
fast because the default way is just
kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.959> slow<00:02:43.260> pulse<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.950> way<00:02:44.239> you'll

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
kind of a slow pulse in this way you'll

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
kind of a slow pulse in this way you'll
get<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.629> quickly<00:02:46.099> there's<00:02:47.099> other<00:02:47.250> stuff

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
get it more quickly there's other stuff

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.710 
get it more quickly there's other stuff
that<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.639> can<00:02:47.790> customize<00:02:47.909> here<00:02:48.389> you<00:02:48.599> can

just leave that alone I never mess with

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.780 
just leave that alone I never mess with

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
you can also check out vibration which

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.599 
you can also check out vibration which
is<00:03:04.409> something<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.859> had<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> little<00:03:05.189> bit<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> fun

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
with because you can enable an app once

with because you can enable an app once
you<00:03:08.250> hit<00:03:08.609> enable<00:03:08.849> vibration<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.319> can<00:03:10.470> adjust

you hit enable vibration you can adjust

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.679 
you hit enable vibration you can adjust
the<00:03:10.799> vibration<00:03:11.280> pattern<00:03:11.669> of<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.939> app<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.629> you

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
the vibration pattern of the app so you

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.179 
the vibration pattern of the app so you
can<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.900> want<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.139> sure<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.769> 3<00:03:14.010> long

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
can do want to sure you can do 3 long

can do want to sure you can do 3 long
vibrations<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:15.000> customize<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.599> I

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
vibrations you can customize that I

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.530 
vibrations you can customize that I
think<00:03:15.959> that's<00:03:16.019> pretty<00:03:16.230> cool<00:03:16.730> but<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:18.449> now

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540

I think that's definitely a pretty cool
feature<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.849> mess<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.540> so
