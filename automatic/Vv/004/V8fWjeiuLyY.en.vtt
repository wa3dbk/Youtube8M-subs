 bachelors raising Hermosillo 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.080
 then let's do a job 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 with 10 exercises this is to learn 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.989
 to touch any touch in free routine 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.579
 let's start with an exercise 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.829
 Let's start simple with 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.180
 Basic exercises the first exercise 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.180
 it's going to be silver or 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.730
 [Music] 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.949
 ok with this exercise you will master what 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.989
 what is the flag touch we do not go with 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.470
 exercise number 2 which is the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.300
 exercise of cuatri pulas 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.890
 [Music] 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.649
 i 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 with this exercise you can master 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.030
 doubled step 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 combining silver 2 with 4 you can 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.159
 master redoubled step and some 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.920
 statutory exercise number three 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.920
 is troop 2 right left 2 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 ok with this exercise because we already dominate 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.420
 some marches 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.130
 Exercise number 4 is a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.909
 introduction for combination dishes 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.579
 not in this case we are going to name it plant 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.979
 plan left 2 let's start with two 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.979
 wings 2 1 2 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.409
 plaut applause exercise number 4 and al 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.409
 Exercise number 5 are the combined 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.330
 Exercise number 6 is redoubling 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.350
 Attention 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.660
 [Music] 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.230
 Exercise number 7 is redoubling 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.230
 attack 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.440
 good if we look at all the touches 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.630
 what we did right now are basic touches 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.690
 for regulatory gears touches 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.239
 We exclude from them the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.760
 planet plan which is the introduction for 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.620
 to be able to learn combination dishes we are going to 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.720
 start with a few touches a little more 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.930
 complicated exercise number 8 if it's 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.930
 the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.370
 let's put some four balls with a 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.129
 dish but increasing a little bit the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.780
 cadence is not pla or right left 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.780
 right left I applaud 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.070
 ok we start slow to increase 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.070
 speed 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.600
 [Music] 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.010
 very good now then we are going to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.830
 start with exercise from right to 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.200
 left this this exercise we are going to 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.690
 explain step by step so that you know what 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.030
 learn fast a way to learn is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.780
 numerically let's start with 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.450
 right 1 2 3 the 3 is the one that we're going to 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 accentuate while 12 we're going to 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.890
 do 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.890
 delicately 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.370
 ok now with left the same 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.370
 right to left we put them together 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.860
 ok so we will continue to reach 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.750
 a desired speed let's start 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:50.270
 slow increasing speed 12 312 3 1 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.270
 2 3 1 2 3 we increase speed 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.129
 ok these are the right exercises 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.019
 left for those exercises I have 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.239
 asked a lot are not very 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.519
 complicated to learn only 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.390
 it requires a little more practice to 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.719
 then exercise number 10 is 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.579
 a combination of 8 and 9 are not the 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.220
 Exercises right left with 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.280
 quickies 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.280
 Y 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.340
 i 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.440
 if these 10 exercises were set 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.360
 They contain absolutely all the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.970
 movements that a routine may have 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.710
 free except the movements where you throw 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.940
 sticks and you turn drumsticks and you hit her 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.710
 to the glass or to the keter or to the hoops 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.160
 these exercises therefore require practice 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.770
 and time next we are going to do 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.290
 exercise the 10 exercises but the student 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.900
 he has to learn to pace and 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.200
 enter from one exercise to another without 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.320
 need to make a halt or a cut in 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.410
 your exercise this is so you can 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.870
 dominate from one entrance to another we go to 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.940
 start marking the step I mentioned the 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.440
 number of the name of the exercise and you 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.310
 you execute 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.310
 silver 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.040
 four waves 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.420
 [Music] 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.420

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.130
 cloud table 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.910
 the combined 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.659
 and 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.409
 redoubled attention 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.979
 attack roll 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.589
 the right exercise left 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.580
 preparation for quickies 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.940
 we revolve exercises 8 and 9 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.830
 i 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.350
 with this you can master exercises and 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.479
 make a free routine of your own 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.080
 box you can help me with just one of 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.080

 this is the video of the 10 exercises 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.020
 to be able to play any touch 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:30.580
 advanced, I thank you 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.900
 ramón dominguez that has been 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.900
 helping a lot with the quickies
