00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
what one of those three personalities at

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.119 
what one of those three personalities at
least<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:43.649> many<00:00:43.829> did<00:00:44.090> yeah<00:00:45.649> yeah<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
least how many did yeah yeah this is

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.220 
least how many did yeah yeah this is
covering<00:00:47.489> every<00:00:47.670> angle<00:00:48.020> probably<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> most

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
covering every angle probably the most

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
covering every angle probably the most
underrated<00:00:49.680> job<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.000> celebrity<00:00:51.480> coaches

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
underrated job of the celebrity coaches

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.380 
underrated job of the celebrity coaches
i<00:00:52.050> would<00:00:52.289> say<00:00:52.500> goes<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.250> more<00:00:53.399> DVD<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.879> many<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
i would say goes to more DVD so many the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
i would say goes to more DVD so many the
others<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> gotten<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.710> publicity

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
others have gotten so much publicity

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670 
others have gotten so much publicity
even<00:00:56.940> before<00:00:57.090> he<00:00:57.329> won<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> US<00:00:58.079> Open<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.500> think

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
even before he won the US Open I think

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
even before he won the US Open I think
he's<00:00:58.770> kept<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> most<00:00:59.309> basic<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.030> with
