00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
love this one I just started using it

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.590 
love this one I just started using it
because<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.590> friend<00:01:13.860> had<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.210> used<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
because my friend had one and I used it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
because my friend had one and I used it
for<00:01:15.780> her<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.290> her<00:01:16.320> makeup<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.340> really

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
for her to do her makeup and I really

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
for her to do her makeup and I really
like<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.940> well<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.180> decided<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.870> for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
like this well I decided to use it for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.370 
like this well I decided to use it for
myself<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.280> linked<00:01:20.640> min<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
myself and it's really linked min and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.300 
myself and it's really linked min and
separates<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> eyelashes<00:01:22.890> really<00:01:23.130> nicely

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
separates the eyelashes really nicely

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.400 
separates the eyelashes really nicely
whereas<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.870> saw<00:01:25.020> while<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> was

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
whereas this one as you saw while I was

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.590 
whereas this one as you saw while I was
pulling<00:01:25.590> putting<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.940> does<00:01:27.180> cramp<00:01:27.510> up

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pulling putting it on it does cramp up

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.110 
pulling putting it on it does cramp up
your<00:01:27.780> eyelashes<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.410> found<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.700> really

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
your eyelashes I found and it is really

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.760 
your eyelashes I found and it is really
messy<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.690> found<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.410> messy<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
messy I found it to be really messy I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
messy I found it to be really messy I
think<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.790> design<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
think it's because of the design of the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
think it's because of the design of the
brush<00:01:33.720> which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.440> really<00:01:34.680> curly<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
brush which is really curly so it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160 
brush which is really curly so it's
really<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.000> difficult<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.750> control

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really like difficult to kind of control

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.520 
really like difficult to kind of control
the<00:01:37.440> way<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:39.060> put<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.509> eyelashes<00:01:40.110> yes

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the way you put it on your eyelashes yes

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
the way you put it on your eyelashes yes
so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> mascara<00:01:42.540> mm<00:01:43.410> i

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so I don't know about this mascara mm i

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260
