here's an original um oh and kind of um
10<00:05:58.419> I<00:05:58.750> would<00:05:59.680> give<00:05:59.919> this<00:05:59.970> up<00:06:02.160> probably

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:14.550 

in<00:06:08.500> eight<00:06:09.570> in<00:06:10.950> an<00:06:11.950> AIDS<00:06:12.420> just<00:06:13.420> because<00:06:13.750> the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
in eight in an AIDS just because the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.310 
in eight in an AIDS just because the
wheels<00:06:14.770> are<00:06:15.010> gone<00:06:15.240> or<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.389> wheels<00:06:16.570> aren't<00:06:17.169> the

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
wheels are gone or the wheels aren't the

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:24.030 
wheels are gone or the wheels aren't the
right<00:06:17.470> wheels<00:06:17.800> because<00:06:18.100> it's<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.520> screw<00:06:18.760> up<00:06:23.040> the

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
right wheels because it's a screw up the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.480 
right wheels because it's a screw up the
and<00:06:24.669> that's<00:06:25.630> pretty<00:06:25.990> much<00:06:26.139> why<00:06:27.040> because<00:06:27.310> these

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
and that's pretty much why because these

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.070 
and that's pretty much why because these
wheels<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:28.090> gotta<00:06:28.240> admit<00:06:28.480> these<00:06:28.660> meals<00:06:28.900> look

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
wheels you gotta admit these meals look

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.800 
wheels you gotta admit these meals look
a<00:06:29.169> lot<00:06:29.650> better<00:06:29.800> than<00:06:30.490> these<00:06:30.610> crap<00:06:31.419> spoke

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
a lot better than these crap spoke

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.730 
a lot better than these crap spoke
wheels<00:06:32.080> um<00:06:32.760> I<00:06:33.810> honestly<00:06:34.810> think<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:35.169> these

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
wheels um I honestly think that these

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.480 
wheels um I honestly think that these
are<00:06:36.190> wheels<00:06:36.610> just<00:06:37.360> just<00:06:38.350> these<00:06:39.040> just<00:06:39.310> wheel

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
are wheels just just these just wheel

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.670 
are wheels just just these just wheel
these<00:06:39.850> wheels<00:06:40.090> just<00:06:41.080> look<00:06:41.230> a<00:06:41.320> whole<00:06:41.620> lot

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
these wheels just look a whole lot

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.820 
these wheels just look a whole lot
better<00:06:42.070> just<00:06:42.820> like<00:06:43.000> on<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:44.770> car<00:06:45.010> if<00:06:45.640> not

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
better just like on the car if not

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.810 
better just like on the car if not
because<00:06:47.830> it<00:06:47.950> just<00:06:48.040> matches<00:06:48.220> a<00:06:48.490> whole<00:06:48.700> lot

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
because it just matches a whole lot

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.810 
because it just matches a whole lot
better<00:06:48.970> than<00:06:49.090> these<00:06:49.330> crap<00:06:49.600> wheels<00:06:49.840> ah<00:06:50.820> so
