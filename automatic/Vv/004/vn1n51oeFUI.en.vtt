the<00:00:08.120> tesla<00:00:08.450> program<00:00:08.780> is<00:00:08.900> a<00:00:08.930> very<00:00:09.170> interesting

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
the tesla program is a very interesting

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.919 
the tesla program is a very interesting
program<00:00:09.950> because<00:00:10.430> the<00:00:11.030> tesla<00:00:11.420> vehicle<00:00:11.750> being

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
program because the tesla vehicle being

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.709 
program because the tesla vehicle being
a<00:00:12.019> sports<00:00:12.260> vehicle<00:00:12.650> it's<00:00:13.510> it's<00:00:14.510> very

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
a sports vehicle it's it's very

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.150 
a sports vehicle it's it's very
constrained<00:00:15.170> in<00:00:15.290> terms<00:00:15.500> of<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:15.740> space<00:00:15.980> that's

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
constrained in terms of the space that's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.340 
constrained in terms of the space that's
available<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:17.000> battery<00:00:17.330> pack<00:00:17.510> it<00:00:17.660> uses<00:00:18.110> is

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
available the battery pack it uses is

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.370 
available the battery pack it uses is
under<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.279> floor<00:00:19.609> which<00:00:20.480> actually<00:00:20.840> raises

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
under the floor which actually raises

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.090 
under the floor which actually raises
the<00:00:21.560> floor<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.850> vehicle<00:00:23.029> quite<00:00:23.720> high<00:00:24.100> but

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
the floor of the vehicle quite high but

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.500 
the floor of the vehicle quite high but
because<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:25.609> a<00:00:25.699> sports<00:00:25.939> vehicle<00:00:26.420> the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
because it's a sports vehicle the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.990 
because it's a sports vehicle the
roofline<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:27.080> very<00:00:27.289> low<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.550> seat<00:00:28.789> is

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
roofline is very low and the seat is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.570 
roofline is very low and the seat is
packaged<00:00:29.869> has<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.260> be<00:00:30.349> packaged<00:00:30.800> in<00:00:31.400> this

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
packaged has to be packaged in this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.110 
packaged has to be packaged in this
space<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.389> so<00:00:33.079> we're<00:00:33.499> burnt<00:00:34.399> from<00:00:34.670> both<00:00:34.850> ends

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
space and so we're burnt from both ends

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.149 
space and so we're burnt from both ends
really<00:00:35.449> so<00:00:36.139> with<00:00:36.319> model<00:00:36.589> s<00:00:36.710> it's<00:00:36.920> quite<00:00:37.129> a

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:37.159 
really so with model s it's quite a

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.430 
really so with model s it's quite a
unique<00:00:37.510> architecture<00:00:38.510> without<00:00:38.690> an<00:00:39.079> internal

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
interior architecture lends itself to a

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.250 
interior architecture lends itself to a
lot<00:00:46.399> of<00:00:46.519> imagination<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.600> what<00:00:47.809> features

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
lot of imagination and what features

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.079 
lot of imagination and what features
could<00:00:48.440> actually<00:00:48.589> bring<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.309> table<00:00:49.489> with

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
could actually bring to the table with

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.939 
could actually bring to the table with
this<00:00:50.269> totally<00:00:50.780> new<00:00:50.809> architecture<00:00:51.530> concept

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
this totally new architecture concept

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.279 
this totally new architecture concept
with<00:00:52.339> different<00:00:52.639> ways<00:00:52.819> to<00:00:52.850> actually<00:00:53.299> expand

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
with different ways to actually expand

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.979 
with different ways to actually expand
on<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:54.859> available<00:00:55.280> space<00:00:55.549> without<00:00:56.389> having

the<00:00:57.469> interior<00:00:57.920> feel<00:00:58.190> like<00:00:58.459> it<00:00:58.909> was<00:00:59.239> dissimilar

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
the interior feel like it was dissimilar

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.819 
the interior feel like it was dissimilar
to<00:01:00.069> an<00:01:01.069> everyday<00:01:01.539> premium<00:01:02.539> luxury<00:01:02.690> sedan<00:01:03.229> so

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
to an everyday premium luxury sedan so

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.039 
to an everyday premium luxury sedan so
our<00:01:04.070> group<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.549> an<00:01:05.119> applied<00:01:05.600> optimization

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
our group is an applied optimization

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.389 
our group is an applied optimization
group<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:07.939> look<00:01:08.210> for<00:01:08.920> industry<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.219> can

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399

lead us on projects that are value to
them<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.609> then<00:01:13.820> we<00:01:13.939> can<00:01:13.969> use<00:01:14.299> our<00:01:14.539> strategies

system<00:01:22.460> which<00:01:23.210> Martin<00:01:23.689> Martin's<00:01:24.560> team<00:01:24.740> was

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
system which Martin Martin's team was

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.910 
system which Martin Martin's team was
involved<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.670> was<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:26.049> key<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
involved in it was a key but the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.469 
involved in it was a key but the
modularity<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.640> C<00:01:28.820> was<00:01:28.969> important<00:01:29.390> as

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
modularity of the C was important as

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.230 
modularity of the C was important as
well<00:01:29.689> because<00:01:30.229> it's<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.560> startup<00:01:31.549> company<00:01:31.789> with

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
well because it's a startup company with

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480 
well because it's a startup company with
relatively<00:01:32.840> lower<00:01:33.109> volume<00:01:33.499> production

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
relatively lower volume production

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.190 
relatively lower volume production
company<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.210> Tesla<00:01:35.539> would<00:01:35.689> want<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.960> spend<00:01:36.079> a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
company like Tesla would want to spend a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.289 
company like Tesla would want to spend a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
lot of money on tooling but they also

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.749 
lot of money on tooling but they also

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
uncomfortably under the seat so that it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.989 
uncomfortably under the seat so that it
feels<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.499> larger<00:01:54.890> car<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:55.909> were

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
feels like a larger car so we were

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.599 
feels like a larger car so we were
constrained<00:01:56.569> in<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.049> way<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.609> automotive

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.169 
seating architectures are usually not

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
constrained so it's a very very highly

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.999

low-cost we can actually sell it in

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.770 
low-cost we can actually sell it in
China<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:00.950> we<00:03:01.340> specifically<00:03:01.940> designed<00:03:02.209> two

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
China so we we specifically designed two

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.289 
China so we we specifically designed two
structures<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.859> be<00:03:04.010> low-cost<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:04.879> sold<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.170 
structures to be low-cost and sold in
China<00:03:05.629> but<00:03:06.560> actually<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.099> may<00:03:07.340> end<00:03:07.609> up<00:03:07.940> being

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
China but actually it may end up being

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.640 
China but actually it may end up being
that<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> one<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.870> we<00:03:08.989> design<00:03:09.349> for<00:03:09.379> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
that the one that we design for the

that the one that we design for the
mature<00:03:10.010> market<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.879> one<00:03:10.909> that<00:03:11.150> becomes

mature market is the one that becomes

the technologies that we apply and it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.890 
the technologies that we apply and it
helps<00:04:01.549> us<00:04:01.669> to<00:04:01.849> be<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.090> best<00:04:02.120> practicing

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
helps us to be the best practicing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.960 
helps us to be the best practicing
engineers<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.410> we<00:04:03.530> can<00:04:03.709> be<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:04.609> seat<00:04:04.819> design

engineers that we can be the seat design

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.059 
engineers that we can be the seat design
required<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.840> fair<00:04:06.049> amount<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.319> collaboration
