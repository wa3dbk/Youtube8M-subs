00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.560
 assess the tie for your team and if you 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.110
 has surprised 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.430
 find more play so clear so clear 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.430
 in the last minutes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.320
 the truth that I think I said in the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
 previous match than to win here 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 you have to have a tad of luck 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 you need almost all computers by 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 score a point win eurocup matches 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.350
 I think we've had it because I 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.440
 I think we have planted expensive 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.420
 a great team we have believed in us 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 until the last moment I believe I 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.309
 agreement that 34 minutes before to abuse 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.540
 had had another clear to tie the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.880
 party and good no I do not have I do not have 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.590
 congratulatory words for my 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 players for the effort they have made 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 have shown that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.229
 after the match against Malaga the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.700
 not showing us in the positions 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 of the decline has made the team has 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.100
 made a great match today and those who 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.050
 final data you have to play with the same 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.080
 spirit you have to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.420
 and do the same job and surely 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.420
 doing that we're going to be in first 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.570
 hello cornyn congratulations for this draw 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 I do not know if you thought the game after 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.109
 that you liked twice 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 up the team could react as 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.579
 reacted and then also angel lafita 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.790
 it looks like he's in a state of face 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.040
 to the goal alone 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.210
 and the truth that we have found with 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.730
 the column injury and we have we 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.490
 had to advance to the appointment as 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.410
 only forward has done a great job 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.120
 a great effort and I think it has 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.730
 searched for the goal until the last moment 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 and well I tell you that being alone to a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.840
 goal always differentiates a stopped ball or 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.299
 some play that you approach the area 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 you can tie the game if the score 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.870
 he had put 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.440
 with summarize when they have had barcelona 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270
 the occasions I think it was more 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 difficult to overcome but being at a 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.350
 goal you can always find with a 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480
 occasion a couple of times as we 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.909
 we have found us 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.670
 if the whole catalunya ràdio is the 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.340
 first time he faces the barça what 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 feeling has given him the game of barça 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.440
 and then on the play of the first goal of the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.019
 getafe that last you do arabia if it is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.549
 this high so let's say it was a play from 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.500
 strategy that you because you have before 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.230
 talked about the week several 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.970
 several various options of fouls and good 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.890
 the truth that we got the appointment and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.420
 well I tell you very happy for the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.160
 work of the guys very happy that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.250
 the last two games the team has 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.860
 given the face and that gives me hope for 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.060
 the two final we have left and the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.160
 barça the team that encloses you did 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.050
 in your field and you have to run double of 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.330
 any other party I do not have to 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.210
 make a big effort to do 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.750
 spaces for the players that 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.210
 can make a difference no note no 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.430
 can you catch the contra no and I think 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.740
 that we have planted it well in the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.690
 party and the guys have made a 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.850
 great effort we had the tad of 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.090
 luck and we leave with a point that 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.760
 can be worth gold at the end of the two 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.540
 ordinances that are left 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.500
 please 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.500
 Thank you
