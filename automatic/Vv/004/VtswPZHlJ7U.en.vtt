00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.550
 hello everyone I'm a close king 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.440
 I had previously brought you a 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.640
 gameplay of legos les gens with the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 process now for 43 thousand 400 but this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 I bring you a new one but with something 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 a little different that is the same 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 processor but this time with the card 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.390
 healthy graphic integration a physics that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.610
 is there is a m radius r 7 240 of a giga 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.560
 of r 5 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.740
 and good is the configuration of the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.980
 game is in resolution 280 280 x 720 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.500
 with full graphics and with synchronization 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.240
 vertical disabled to this 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 configuration recording with fractions 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.140
 it works 30 fps without downshones whether they're tim 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.890
 fain 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.250
 and above 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.000
 without recording the game works about 60 70 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.020
 and 80 fps 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.450
 and gyms with peaks from 100 to 120 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.530
 also the truth works very fluid the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.340
 game 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.340
 the graph 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.299
 he tries to kill her 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 moritz 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.460
 It's very stupid of me 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.110
 good as is saying the card 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.670
 graph is pretty good so that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.909
 those who do not have a lot of money with 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 ball with new ones now 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.679
 so far has run all the games 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 that I put him either toilet with three 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.689
 written 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.460
 crisis 3 and even some in graphics 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.049
 stockings others in high to about pps 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.650
 coming soon bringing more items of 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.610
 legos reading this part in part 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.700
 specific torias 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.800
 since I still have to play the 10 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 so they will understand 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.650
 in the previous session that is not about 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.590
 get gold back with these ten 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:17.870
 to be able to start the euro start to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.930
 platinum at least this month and I can 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.340
 well that was all I hope that I have 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.650
 served this video so they have 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.129
 thought of buying this graphics card in 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.240
 a future since the processor also 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.670
 I recommend rather have 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.010
 good 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.630
 performance to heavy of price that has 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.330
 let's continue 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.930
 good with this I say goodbye see you a 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.930
 greeting everyone
