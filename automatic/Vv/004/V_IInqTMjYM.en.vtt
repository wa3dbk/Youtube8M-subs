00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
usability when it comes to a mobile

usability when it comes to a mobile
gaming<00:00:43.089> platform<00:00:43.839> in<00:00:44.050> my<00:00:44.170> opinion<00:00:44.530> right<00:00:44.649> now

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
gaming platform in my opinion right now

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.919 
gaming platform in my opinion right now
and<00:00:45.010> yes<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.729> does<00:00:45.760> include<00:00:46.030> all<00:00:46.659> the

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
and yes that does include all the

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.169 
and yes that does include all the
traditional<00:00:47.729> competition<00:00:48.729> that's<00:00:48.909> non

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
traditional competition that's non

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.229 
traditional competition that's non
Android<00:00:49.859> so<00:00:50.859> meaning<00:00:51.339> I'm<00:00:51.579> not<00:00:51.670> talking<00:00:52.149> about

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
Android so meaning I'm not talking about

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.379 
Android so meaning I'm not talking about
just<00:00:52.659> mobile<00:00:53.499> platforms<00:00:54.190> like<00:00:54.429> iOS<00:00:54.670> and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
just mobile platforms like iOS and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.180 
just mobile platforms like iOS and
Android<00:00:56.339> anymore<00:00:57.339> or<00:00:57.850> including<00:00:58.479> Vita<00:00:58.749> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
Android anymore or including Vita and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.779 
Android anymore or including Vita and
anything<00:01:00.190> Nintendo<00:01:00.789> at<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.149> point<00:01:02.789> after

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
anything Nintendo at this point after

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.900 
anything Nintendo at this point after
all<00:01:04.120> that<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.570> what<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:05.160> product<00:01:06.160> is<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.670> part

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
all that is what this product is in part

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.990 
all that is what this product is in part
after<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.590> being<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.980> streaming<00:01:09.460> gaming

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
after not just being a streaming gaming

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.150 
after not just being a streaming gaming
device<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.650> also<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:12.040> great<00:01:12.310> portable<00:01:13.000> console

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.920 

almost<00:01:18.160> took<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.490> one<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.820> face

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:35.649 

things<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.080> getting<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.500> messy

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.270 

I<00:01:37.930> think<00:01:38.930> they<00:01:39.080> suggest<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.770> use<00:01:39.979> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
I think they suggest that I use the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.399 
I think they suggest that I use the
rifle<00:01:40.820> for<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.330> round<00:01:41.570> but<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.020> course<00:01:42.259> I

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
rifle for this round but of course I

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.240 
rifle for this round but of course I
didn't<00:01:42.619> listen

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.690 

well<00:01:47.619> almost<00:01:48.619> call<00:01:49.009> me<00:01:49.190> oh<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.820> did<00:01:50.180> get<00:01:50.360> caught

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.770 

in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.299> head

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
in the head

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.570 
in the head
oh<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:01.220> think<00:02:01.430> they<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:03.159> read<00:02:04.159> them<00:02:04.369> right

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
oh I think they just read them right

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:20.750 
oh I think they just read them right
next<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.970> me

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.250 

getting<00:02:21.760> up<00:02:21.880> close<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.180> personal<00:02:22.780> there<00:02:22.990> for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
getting up close and personal there for

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.910 
getting up close and personal there for
the<00:02:23.350> camera<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.780> about<00:02:32.020> cleaned<00:02:32.320> house<00:02:32.590> here

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the camera just about cleaned house here

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:49.830 
the camera just about cleaned house here
I<00:02:32.950> believe

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.140 

you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.350> see<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.710> textures<00:02:51.520> from<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> water

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
you can see the textures from the water

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.590 
you can see the textures from the water
I<00:02:52.510> mean<00:02:53.110> it's<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.040> graphics<00:02:54.340> are<00:02:54.820> solid

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
I mean it's just the graphics are solid

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910 
I mean it's just the graphics are solid
and<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.840> isn't<00:02:56.170> even<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.740> more

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
and this isn't even one of the more

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.610 
and this isn't even one of the more
optimized<00:02:57.430> taught<00:02:57.700> titles<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:59.050> course<00:02:59.320> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
optimized taught titles of course the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.440 
optimized taught titles of course the
sequel<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.370> game<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:01.030> coming<00:03:01.300> out

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
sequel to this game will be coming out

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.750 
sequel to this game will be coming out
in<00:03:02.260> October<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> think<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.520> will<00:03:03.730> be

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
in October and I think that will be

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.830 
in October and I think that will be
extraordinarily<00:03:04.480> popular<00:03:06.690> specifically<00:03:07.690> for

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
extraordinarily popular specifically for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.940 
extraordinarily popular specifically for
the<00:03:07.930> shield<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.290> mean<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.500> course<00:03:08.680> it'll<00:03:08.890> be

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
the shield I mean of course it'll be

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.060 
the shield I mean of course it'll be
popular<00:03:09.430> for<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.640> platform<00:03:09.910> meaning<00:03:11.070> for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
popular for the platform meaning for

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.500 
popular for the platform meaning for
Android<00:03:12.550> but<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.610> shield<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.180> think<00:03:16.390> this

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
Android but for the shield I think this

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.180 
Android but for the shield I think this
is<00:03:16.660> definitely<00:03:17.170> one<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.620> better<00:03:17.890> games

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
is definitely one of the better games

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.590 
is definitely one of the better games
out<00:03:18.580> there<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:20.460> there<00:03:21.460> are<00:03:21.490> quite<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:21.970> few<00:03:22.209> good

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
out there and there are quite a few good

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.720 
out there and there are quite a few good
you<00:03:22.959> know<00:03:23.080> solid<00:03:23.410> titles<00:03:23.980> right<00:03:24.220> now<00:03:24.400> without

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
you know solid titles right now without

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.910 
you know solid titles right now without
having<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.150> break<00:03:25.360> out<00:03:25.600> PC<00:03:26.050> compatibility<00:03:26.560> for

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
having to break out PC compatibility for

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.060 
having to break out PC compatibility for
streaming<00:03:30.780> looks<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:32.020> everybody<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.830> coming

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
streaming looks like everybody is coming

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:42.950 
streaming looks like everybody is coming
up<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.400> me

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.770 

I<00:03:45.530> think<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.740> pretty<00:03:46.950> much<00:03:47.070> serves<00:03:47.780> to

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
I think that pretty much serves to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.260 
I think that pretty much serves to
demonstrate<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.970> little

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
demonstrate that this this little

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.920 
demonstrate that this this little
portable<00:03:51.810> console<00:03:52.380> has<00:03:52.590> got<00:03:52.830> what<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.190> takes<00:03:53.220> I

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
portable console has got what it takes I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.260 
portable console has got what it takes I
mean<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.050> really<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.730> next<00:03:56.730> level<00:03:56.880> when<00:03:57.240> it

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
mean it really is next level when it

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.130 
mean it really is next level when it
comes<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.900> what<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.680> would<00:03:58.950> ever<00:03:59.220> expect<00:04:00.140> from

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
comes to what I would ever expect from

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.210 
comes to what I would ever expect from
something<00:04:01.830> driven<00:04:02.520> by<00:04:02.700> jelly<00:04:03.030> bean<00:04:04.220> forget

something driven by jelly bean forget

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.520 
something driven by jelly bean forget

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that everything before it was just a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.020 
that everything before it was just a
joke<00:04:07.830> when<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.160> came<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.490> trying<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.850> integrate

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
joke when it came to trying to integrate
