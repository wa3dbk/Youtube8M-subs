technology and hopefully help you make a

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.499 
technology and hopefully help you make a
decision<00:00:22.449> as<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.050> which<00:00:23.910> technology<00:00:24.910> is<00:00:25.119> right

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
decision as to which technology is right

for you c7 and c9 incandescent bulbs

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.620 
for you c7 and c9 incandescent bulbs
have<00:00:29.949> been<00:00:30.099> around<00:00:30.339> for<00:00:30.669> a<00:00:30.699> very<00:00:30.999> long<00:00:31.150> time

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
have been around for a very long time

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.810 
have been around for a very long time
they<00:00:32.200> have<00:00:32.439> somewhat<00:00:33.010> become<00:00:33.400> synonymous

the introduction of LED technology does

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.360 
the introduction of LED technology does
offer<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:40.239> new<00:00:40.420> twist<00:00:40.809> when<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.800> start<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.190> talk

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
offer a new twist when you start to talk

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.310 
offer a new twist when you start to talk
about<00:00:42.670> why<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.059> would<00:00:43.449> want<00:00:43.719> to<00:00:43.870> use<00:00:44.079> LED

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
about why you would want to use LED

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.259 
about why you would want to use LED
technology<00:00:44.739> or<00:00:45.250> what<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.609> benefits<00:00:46.059> are

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
technology or what the benefits are

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.330 
technology or what the benefits are
there's<00:00:46.840> numerous<00:00:47.140> but<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.829> first<00:00:48.039> one<00:00:48.250> that

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
there's numerous but the first one that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.459 
there's numerous but the first one that
I<00:00:48.399> would<00:00:48.640> point<00:00:48.879> out<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:49.570> any<00:00:50.109> LED

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
I would point out is that any LED

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.610 
I would point out is that any LED
retrofit<00:00:51.420> replacement<00:00:52.420> bulbs<00:00:52.719> are<00:00:53.079> going<00:00:53.199> to

retrofit replacement bulbs are going to

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.069 
retrofit replacement bulbs are going to
work<00:00:53.920> with<00:00:54.519> any<00:00:54.730> existing<00:00:55.120> stringers<00:00:55.870> that

the touch and they last a lot longer for
a<00:01:03.070> couple<00:01:03.399> different<00:01:03.460> reasons<00:01:03.720> they<00:01:04.720> are

and this is important for two reasons
one<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.240> save<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.660> significant<00:01:41.290> amount

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
one it can save you significant amount

of money on your power bill second it
will<00:01:44.200> allow<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.710> string<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:45.550> lights

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
will allow you to string more lights

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.730 
will allow you to string more lights
together<00:01:46.120> because<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.900> doesn't<00:01:47.230> put<00:01:47.380> nearly

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
together because it doesn't put nearly

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.420 
together because it doesn't put nearly
as<00:01:47.860> much<00:01:48.130> stress<00:01:48.550> on<00:01:48.790> your<00:01:49.090> circuit<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.860> final

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
reason that people very much find LED

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800 
reason that people very much find LED
bulbs<00:01:53.920> appealing<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.550> that<00:01:55.120> they<00:01:55.300> will<00:01:55.540> not

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
bulbs appealing is that they will not

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.530 
bulbs appealing is that they will not
fade<00:01:56.230> over<00:01:56.530> time<00:01:56.800> whereas<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> incandescent

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
fade over time whereas a incandescent

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.860 
fade over time whereas a incandescent
bulb<00:01:59.020> will<00:01:59.230> sometimes<00:01:59.680> scratch<00:02:00.220> our<00:02:00.610> fade<00:02:01.330> or

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
bulb will sometimes scratch our fade or

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.830 
bulb will sometimes scratch our fade or
crack<00:02:02.350> an<00:02:02.800> LED<00:02:03.340> bulb<00:02:03.580> will<00:02:04.090> not<00:02:04.330> do<00:02:04.600> that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
crack an LED bulb will not do that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.980
