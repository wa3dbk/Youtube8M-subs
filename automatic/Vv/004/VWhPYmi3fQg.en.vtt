00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
which is a little bit better than the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.520

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
another glitch um this one's pretty cool

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.960 
another glitch um this one's pretty cool
but<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.640> not<00:04:00.570> really<00:04:00.870> useful<00:04:01.019> at<00:04:01.350> all<00:04:01.610> um<00:04:02.610> you

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
but it's not really useful at all um you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.520 
but it's not really useful at all um you
get<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.390> plant<00:04:03.690> actually<00:04:03.989> sitting<00:04:04.440> in

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
get in this plant actually sitting in

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.660 
get in this plant actually sitting in
the<00:04:04.650> plant<00:04:04.890> would<00:04:05.040> probably<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.489> more

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
the plant would probably be more

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.509 
the plant would probably be more
effective<00:04:06.090> than<00:04:06.120> doing<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.690> doing<00:04:07.519> but

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
effective than doing what I'm doing but

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.520 
effective than doing what I'm doing but
all<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.880> get<00:04:09.120> right<00:04:09.269> up<00:04:09.330> there<00:04:09.630> make<00:04:10.320> sure<00:04:10.350> you

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
all you get right up there make sure you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.490 
all you get right up there make sure you
keep<00:04:10.680> your<00:04:10.739> left<00:04:11.160> when<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.370> do<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.700> jump<00:04:12.500> not

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
keep your left when you do this jump not

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.770 
keep your left when you do this jump not
that<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.860> what<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.130> previous<00:04:14.519> one<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:14.940> you

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
that one what the previous one but you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.710 
that one what the previous one but you
get<00:04:15.900> up<00:04:15.990> on<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:18.330> can<00:04:18.510> just

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
get up on here and then you can just

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.930 
get up on here and then you can just
kill<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.169> couple<00:04:19.349> people<00:04:19.680> what

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
kill a couple people what

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.820 
kill a couple people what
your<00:04:21.360> raid<00:04:21.540> on<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.870> open<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.350> not<00:04:22.380> gonna<00:04:22.650> do

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
your raid on the open is not gonna do

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.790 
your raid on the open is not gonna do
you<00:04:22.920> much<00:04:23.070> good<00:04:23.510> on<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> couple<00:04:25.350> good<00:04:25.470> lines<00:04:25.650> of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
you much good on a couple good lines of

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.580 
you much good on a couple good lines of
sight<00:04:25.980> from<00:04:26.100> up<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:27.050> kill<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> couple<00:04:28.440> people

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
sight from up here kill a couple people

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.110 
sight from up here kill a couple people
this<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.040> better<00:04:29.280> spot<00:04:29.550> cuz<00:04:29.760> you're<00:04:29.880> more

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
this is a better spot cuz you're more

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.480 
this is a better spot cuz you're more
hot<00:04:30.780> up<00:04:31.020> high<00:04:31.200> not<00:04:31.770> many<00:04:31.950> people<00:04:32.100> are<00:04:32.220> gonna<00:04:32.370> be

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
hot up high not many people are gonna be

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.070 
hot up high not many people are gonna be
looking<00:04:32.790> for<00:04:32.820> somebody<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.930> room

like that and this is a completely

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.020 
like that and this is a completely
pointless<00:04:36.510> glitch<00:04:36.960> right<00:04:37.230> here<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:38.910> do

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
pointless glitch right here and just do

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.450 
pointless glitch right here and just do
a<00:04:39.060> little<00:04:39.240> strafe<00:04:39.630> crouch<00:04:40.220> jump<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.370> Crouch
