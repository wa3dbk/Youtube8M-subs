00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.930
 good evening girls I find you this 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.130
 evening to do a hairdressing tutorial you and 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.389
 me it's a photo on facebook you 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.410
 have been many to tell me this was 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:21.340
 super nice it was ultra simple and I 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.880
 you had proposed a tutorial is equal on 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.220
 my fabien photo on my photo had a 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.580
 great success so of course I lose weight 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.550
 cooked and I'll realize this tutorial 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.490
 so first of all you need no 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.680
 or foam or if you put me 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.910
 oil like this so it's the stage 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.149
 from l'orÃ©al I wanted to present 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:49.719
 in my favorites so here or here 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.050
 he brushes or a comb at the choice of 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.090
 little elastic like that so all 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.350
 little exercises like this so I 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 take them transparent so that it gets 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.449
 did not see that it was really discreet 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.070
 and then, well, that's all 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.820
 it is better not to have the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.980
 clean hair 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.659
 if you washed yesterday or the day before 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.520
 it's perfect it's not worth it 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.040
 to have super clean otherwise you have them 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.439
 hair that slips too much and it's not 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.720
 it's not good to do and hairstyle and 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.600
 if you can so you waved them 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.100
 hair or yeah that's a doubled 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.390
 it's very very very good or so 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.860
 you washed them especially do not 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 drag by the pikes the anything that 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.759
 either send us the mop by radiant 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 and so so here I think I have 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.770
 nothing forgot to tell you and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.960
 no it's all so so where do you 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.640
 your marriage proposal but always 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.750
 there is almost zero when I do not do it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 myself that it is done naturally 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 it's still the toxin he likes the side 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.939
 neither really middle there it is still there 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.460
 which I'm going to leave here I fight 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.110
 to be contrarien of head and so you 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.210
 can do very well with the stop 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.759
 in the middle very pronounced very marked 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.140
 it's very pretty or the two sides stop 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.429
 but the side part must still 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 have a lot of hair for not too much 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.800
 have a thickness shift to make 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.200
 what are we going to do 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.330
 so I'm going to turn I hope that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.239

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.980
 if it's a foam it's the same 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 process 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.260
 and you will return your hands your 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.160
 fingers a round hair is passed the oil 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.160
 a little bit everywhere 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:55.750
 so that's why then so you 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.129
 trace your rice bias so I 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.650

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.510
 hop 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.430
 hair or series 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.070
 you take two sections 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:52.210
 you will understand both 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.210
 intersections 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.759
 masashi 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.300
 ac yes place 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.300
 you will tighten 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:26.389
 then you detach others 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:28.310
 wick and that's what it gives so 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.370
 here I checked 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.350
 I checked and everything is fine so 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.419
 so here it is a little hairstyle 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.800
 super fast after what you can 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.630
 to do if you have pretty bar or 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.090
 pretty and visible entries in 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.380
 every little hole is there at that moment 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.930
 it's a little more evening or 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.590
 little more marriage and the turn is 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.330

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.090
 after you can very well take them 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.250
 these two locks and in the quilt 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.050
 but me they do not go so I prefer 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.289
 leave them like that and as they are 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.810
 a little wavy it makes the movement 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.729
