00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.339
 Welcome to the cracker http // en find 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.059
 we want to show you how he deals with firecrackers Mac 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.309
 or hans-Peter Martin if he holds a VW Golf 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.880
 as the first signal 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.539
 it is very different than Windows 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.859
 For example, you have customers 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.910
 the dock 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 that's what the bar is called. Programs are in it 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.550
 and the desktop that is money background the desktop 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830
 and 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.050
 you can easily change that works like minus 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.710
 just right mouse click 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.289
 Change image in the background 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.020
 and then you have yes 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.380
 Previous year 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.910
 be 60 in part 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.940
 Well, too 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.780
 you have left at the bottom of the bar 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.440
 the finer 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.750
 that corresponds to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.680
 the workplace 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 because - there you find yourself 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 pretty good and right 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.710
 Neo smoke 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.120
 Esther these stamps 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.600
 Locate the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.420
 The letter market to choose that's just for the men you are there once 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 logged in is quite convenient 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.230
 then you can not retrieve his emails 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.850
 without first going to the internet 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850
 then enter the address to log in 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.430
 but with a simple click on it 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.410
 then you have safari 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.810
 Safari is like Internet Explorer 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.370
 Firefox and so on 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.610
 that is very clearly arranged but works the same way 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.270
 like the others too 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.890
 then you have to afford under this empty percent where to find the address 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
 if my money is still something that you also at minus 8 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.119
 for example, wants soon 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.119
 I do not know the sides you like to keep the ones you put in there 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.269
 yes and then you have just this book 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.469
 that's the age the book 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.829
 are just a few addresses in it you also a spokesman in Cannes goes 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.639
 everything 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.089
 very easy stop 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.599
 Apple motto "Think Different" and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.789
 that's almost self-explanatory 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:26.950
 there you have to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.369
 a little bit deal with just very briefly and then you have one 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.579
 then the calendar 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.510
 I like it very much because you can with the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.889
 the iPhone the iPod Touch 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.269
 for alone 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.429
 the iPad and so you can then sync it 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.049
 and he is very, too 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.589
 clearly arranged 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.389
 then we come to one conclusion 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.609
 as boys 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.689
 These media players are always there 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.359
 on Windows and 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.209
 yes since it is time to play PEA for music for 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.409
 Videos and lessons are so 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.409
 symbol 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.179
 around 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.399
 you can see that the plasmid 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.039
 and 401 percent 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.160
 Georg r 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.299
 Knigge could have iPhone iPad 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.069
 is familiar with that is quite simple 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.099
 if you want to make the music Reimer on it you go to the itunes store man 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.299
 is logged in 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.250
 Draw a CD 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.290
 and he asks immediately if you want to import it or not 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.399
 there is no photo 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.739
 that's just the program where you 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.739
 the photos then he gets edited and so on 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:43.709
 next to a photo 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.619
 is there a Mori? 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.659
 then you can make videos cut 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:49.769
 around 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.610
 also co-plaintiffs do that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.929
 is everything 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.039
 very much about France 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.779
 but also keeps it clear 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.109
 if then the victories Kerber 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.329
 Garmash band 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.499
 around 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.769
 with soothing tango music stuff there are 4 1 for musical instruments for 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.259
 Macs and 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.400
 Since you can then without microphone things record them no idea 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:17.039
 the 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.329
 work well 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.850
 ten individual things we then make special consequences now full 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.439
 Ines still imagine it 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.789
 In any case, next to the guitar, a so-called stent 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.960
 he is then also Keaton 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.460
 without people in addition to keynote panels Peters and took what but these three 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.070
 You have to stop programs too 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.789
 join in 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.129
 it corresponds to years this 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.909
 a Microsoft dissolves package Klum sports fan and Dexcel 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 Haiti, for example, is also kicking off the project 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.050
 yes goal is not even next to April 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.439
 is meant for conception the cinema 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.909
 and 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.490
 yes, this diagram 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 until finally the AXA calls itself names used 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.820
 yes then you have then 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.800
 who regrets this 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 the lines diplomats 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.419
 and 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.150
 next to this blue folder is still going on 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.379
 These are programmed once 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.749
 and then you are commenting 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.699
 In the winter, everything turns back into what stores have what you ordered 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.699
 has and so on 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.650
 then and one more thing 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.650
 the search engines, so to speak, in the computer 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.439
 if the spotlight is on the top right and is through escaping everything so 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.849
 File crave scripture all ever was the word and occurrences 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.949
 and he noticed that this is not working properly or something 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.930
 then he mixes 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.300
 Justin do 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.839
 that was it actually already ahead 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.290
 cha-cha-cha d 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.869
 Corner for beginners 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:08.300
 and in the next episode we show you Fliegers 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.319

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.499
 the keyboard 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:13.729
 he also gets for JÃ¼lich in the certain 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:14.789
