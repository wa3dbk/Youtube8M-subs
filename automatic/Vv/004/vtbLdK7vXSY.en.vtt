00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 greet the main channel with you just 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.559
 once and this trials vision again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 again we continue to pass this 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.310
 the game and this time as I have long 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.199
 long ago will be tested so our 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 the first level you are with us 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.340
 We were still on beta 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.090
 this horror turbines choose our favorite with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 you motorcycle role and in the go-track 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.640
 drove and so let's first see 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 trials we need immaculate 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.289
 somersault the track without a single mistake 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.149
 by performing at least 10 somersault and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.610
 grace to stop the turbines to find 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 hidden switch inflexible one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 pass the track without a single mistake never 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.879
 not leaning well then try so 1 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.840
 and 2 is great because the main thing here is not to lose 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.760
 speed is bad so far as beautiful 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 here are two we can 34 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.740
 ok come on come on 567 no those who are sisters 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.880
 at friday broke 8 so here 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:31.409
 dangerously dangerous dangerously no time and 9 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.090
 excellent wardrobe last and 1011 even so 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.189
 did just in case one will do 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.390
 12 Well, what if now 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.039
 let's safely say so finish 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.700
 level are you on the steps careful 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:50.670
 here is a very big file chance 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.079
 passed the following test perfectly 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.200
 so now we have to find 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.349
 hidden switch I naturally know 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.679
 where is he therefore telling the white topic 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:06.459
 such a chip accelerates and jumps 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.179
 as a sixth passage hold 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 space for the edge of the slow buttons and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.230
 let go of everything and our turbines 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 stopped 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 tests let's say so completed all 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.620
 Now you can proceed to the third 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.739
 the last test and so the most difficult 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.160
 the test here is for us all 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.019
 just need to forget about the buttons 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.069
 left and right you can even pick out 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.680
 their keyboards 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.319
 because i'm at the moment irregular or 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.420
 otherwise started clicking on them and 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.230
 use only the button gases 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.989
 exclusively button cake here 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.000
 I didnâ€™t use a button at all 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.310
 the brakes here the brake so back a little 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.530
 a little so now neatly and gas 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.050
 We give gas and here again do not slow down 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.750
 here it is necessary 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.780
 slow down to make our motorcycle slow 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.380
 I started out as a different turn after 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.980
 that i'm braking here again now 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.010
 gazuy-gazuy 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.230
 and all neatly neatly here 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.660
 we move through the steps here 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.850
 better to slow down but act carefully 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.760
 and the test is passed on this I think 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.390
 This part of the test let's say 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.680
 each episode will end one by one 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.870
 road passed 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.030
 that's why if you liked not 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.730
 forget to put your fingers up 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.850
 call also subscribe to the channel with 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.330
 you were just dance and see you 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.790
 the next part of the test in 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.790
 For now, bye to the game, the Chancellor
