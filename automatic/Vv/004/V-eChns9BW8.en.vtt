00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello friends in this video I love you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.020
 explain a little more about what's going 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.179
 to try the contest that only throws the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 Yesterday through Facebook 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.809
 first of all he clarified that it is not 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.830
 to make me a logo because the logo 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 I already have it this this is about 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 you think use a form 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.510
 creative in which you can include my 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.760
 logo can be in photo can be in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 video can be in presentation or as 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.859
 you want some examples that I 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.739
 I put them and I'll explain it this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.710
 for saying like the kindergarten logo 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.079
 collector and I draw it in my style at 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.960
 better I draw it with pure pencils with 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 pure grayscale and it may be that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 be a father and that would be my participation 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 or I draw it with crayons or with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.379
 down or in some way that looks 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 father and maybe not only put the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.559
 logo because you can see very 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 simple that nothing else draws on the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.940
 logo they might say I'm going to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 draw on a sheet the logo of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 kinder collector and around I'm going to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.299
 put a figure of my character 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 favorite that is ironman and maybe he will 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.689
 I'm going to put 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.960
 something totally different as jake the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 dog and would be a matter of you 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.119
 is what they want to do if it's assuming 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.429
 a drawing options that I have seen in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.319
 other contests for example I saw that 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.869
 there were people to do the 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.000
 x company logo grabbed leaves of 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.819
 the trees of different colors by 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.209
 example green and coffee dating and 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:36.630
 accommodated for the leaves to form 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:39.090
 the company logo another option 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.579
 for telling them something they can buy 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 paper doctrine or paper of china what 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.250
 cut out and with those in the letters of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.929
 kinder collector this a participant already 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.569
 he sent me a picture where he makes a 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.390
 simple drawing of kinder collector to his 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.909
 style I do not care that they leave the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.069
 logo that I have from the kinder collected 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.319
 you can put it to your style you do not have to 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.539
 be exactly like he did from a 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.729
 different way but says kinder 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.980
 collector and in the corners of the drawing 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.820
 he put characters then for 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.080
 the drawing is also valid in another 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.230
 contest and for example that a person 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.290
 he took a stone and on the stone he painted with 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 pink tourists the logo of the brand and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.440
 He also looked very father 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.330
 another option is that the best you can not 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.300
 give them the drawing and want 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.740
 participate like they could not to the best 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.530
 it is always simply to print the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.010
 logo of kinder collector this what 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.280
 they go down they print it they cut it and they put it 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.410
 in any of your collections for this one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.390
 show us what they have this too 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.100
 It can be very valid and maybe if it is 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 a collection that is beautiful even if 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.030
 small or that is impressive that is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 very big and with the logo of the kinder 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.170
 collector that can help me 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 select let's assume that this that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.370
 out more bigger or mini better we go 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.590
 to take assuming that here I print 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.360
 the logo of kinder collector and what 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.260
 cut and we're going to assume that it 's like this 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.570
 I put it with one of my collections and what 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.700
 we put like this to take a picture of that 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.880
 way I know that you are 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.370
 participating is because they dedicated him 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.110
 the time to print the logo and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.020
 put it with your collections what I do not 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.240
 I want is for them to grab because they have 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.460
 done in many competitions and for me it 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.800
 It looks pretty ugly to say good here is the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.200
 kinder collector logo 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.910
 I'm going to cut with paint and I'm going to paste it 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.600
 on top of a photo that I found on 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.360
 Internet 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.570
 that for me because it is not to dedicate 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.180
 absolutely no time and for me 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.680
 it would not be something that I select unless 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 that it's a job that I see super 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.940
 elaborated that the best someone says 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.070
 I'm taking the kindergarten logo 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.740
 collector and I'm getting him many 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.710
 effects so that it looks very father to 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.720
 logo and I put it with some drawing that 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.290
 I myself have done in photoshop or with 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.050
 the draw or something like that but this one like this 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.170
 you can download from the internet I'm not 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.470
 so according to the idea that it 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.810
 something an image with things that have not 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.420
 done you I prefer it to be something 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.560
 what do you do, I would tell you 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.890
 several ideas several options there is not this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.200
 well limits for the creativity that 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.500
 may have you tell them may it be 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.840
 a photo can be a video where the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.780
 better your collection is very large and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.750
 say good I'll show you on video 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.910
 all my collection and inside 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.950
 of the video I will have a logo of 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.800
 kinder collector more than anything so that I 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.720
 I can assure you that this is real and 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.080
 I do not know maybe a video that came down from 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.810
 of internet where perhaps nothing else are 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.000
 changing the voice and it's not real but 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.610
 good friends, I hope that with this 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.890
 explanation that I am giving you and makes 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.620
 a little bit clearer for you who is 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.320
 what I what I look for or what I 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.680
 I hope I also explain, I tell them 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.510
 that I'm going to select three people to 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 the ones I like the most, do not see what else 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.230
 they put what they send me 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.190
 and this assuming they become 50 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.770
 participants 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.250
 I will select instead of three up 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.700
 five people and assuming they are 100 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.800
 participants or more would select 10 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.220
 it's the maximum number of participants that I'm going to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.350
 select 10 for the raffle but if they are 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.840
 less than 50 those who come to participate 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.750
 the majority will select three for 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.400
 participate in a raffle that when you 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.760
 selected I'll tell you the exact day 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.130
 what is going to be that raffle 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.320
 the raffle will be according to the lottery 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.240
 Mexican national so that you do not 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.110
 think that I'm going to cheat for 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.640
 favor one or the other then then 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.860
 well I hope that with this video it 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.980
 clarify several of the doubts that they had 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.200
 you have more questions send me 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.990
 those on facebook this video I'm going to 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.490
 upload only what I'm going to put in 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.620
 youtube but only the 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.390
 facebook people to give them a little 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.560
 of advantage they have more time to 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.750
 think and in a week or so longer 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.940
 notify the rest of the contest channel 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.680
 because well they did not like it 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.600
 to the facebook page are they 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.940
 losing the opportunity to go 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.710
 advancing with this, well, good friends , 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.220
 we see in the next video on YouTube 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.220
 see you later
