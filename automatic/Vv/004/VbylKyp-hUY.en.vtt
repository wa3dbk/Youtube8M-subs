00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
light golden brown color because if you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
light golden brown color because if you
burn<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.360> that'll<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.899> minging<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.619> your

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
burn it that'll be minging with your

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
burn it that'll be minging with your
feeling<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.159> stage<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.149> pour

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
feeling at that stage it's time to pour

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.639 
feeling at that stage it's time to pour
it<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> molds<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.170> obviously<00:01:49.439> doing

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it into the molds now obviously doing

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
it into the molds now obviously doing
what<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.430> quite<00:01:50.670> hard<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> film<00:01:51.210> because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
what I do is quite hard to film because

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
what I do is quite hard to film because
it<00:01:51.479> does<00:01:51.659> cool<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:51.990> very<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.470> quickly

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it does cool down very very quickly

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.530 
it does cool down very very quickly
so<00:01:53.340> here's<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> quickly<00:01:53.970> captured<00:01:54.390> I
