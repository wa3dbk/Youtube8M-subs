00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.260 
okay but we are running out of time but
like<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.159> said<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> us<00:01:38.759> require<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like I said some of us require you to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.760 
like I said some of us require you to
kill<00:01:39.509> enemies<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.020> levels<00:01:40.290> require<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
kill enemies some levels require you to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
kill enemies some levels require you to
and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> other<00:01:41.340> levels<00:01:41.729> require<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and then the other levels require you to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
and then the other levels require you to
just<00:01:42.960> collect<00:01:43.259> timers<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.009> personally<00:01:44.430> for

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
just collect timers I personally for

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
just collect timers I personally for
collecting<00:01:45.030> timers<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> killing<00:01:45.869> enemies

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
collecting timers and killing enemies

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
collecting timers and killing enemies
because<00:01:46.920> killing<00:01:47.220> enemies<00:01:47.549> requires<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
because killing enemies requires you to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.319 
because killing enemies requires you to
interact<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.740> some<00:01:50.040> way<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
interact with them in some way and that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
interact with them in some way and that
means<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.350> possibly<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:53.040> hit<00:01:53.250> by<00:01:53.399> them

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
means you could possibly get hit by them

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
means you could possibly get hit by them
and<00:01:53.790> here's<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> second<00:01:54.750> star<00:01:54.930> medal<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and here's the second star medal this is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.630 
and here's the second star medal this is
the<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.189> moved<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> location

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the one they actually moved the location

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
the one they actually moved the location
of<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:58.049> thing<00:01:58.200> about<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:59.040> don't

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of and good thing about that I don't

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.180 
of and good thing about that I don't
even<00:01:59.399> know<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> honestly<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.570> really

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
even know I honestly I'm not really

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.910 
even know I honestly I'm not really
if<00:02:01.490> they<00:02:02.210> did<00:02:02.420> move<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.660> location<00:02:03.260> or<00:02:03.350> not<00:02:03.440> but

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
if they did move the location or not but

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.970 
if they did move the location or not but
um<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:05.270> don't<00:02:05.840> know<00:02:05.990> I'll<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.680> look<00:02:06.770> into

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
um I don't know I'll have to look into

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.420 
um I don't know I'll have to look into
that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
that

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.000 
that
all<00:02:08.150> right<00:02:08.390> here<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:09.200> think<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.500> can<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.650> go

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
all right here I think we can just go

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.360 
all right here I think we can just go
down<00:02:10.330> no<00:02:11.330> okay<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.750> missed<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.370> doesn't

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
down no okay I missed that doesn't

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
down no okay I missed that doesn't
really<00:02:13.490> matter<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:13.850> we're<00:02:14.120> literally

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
really matter because we're literally

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.120 
really matter because we're literally
tore<00:02:14.720> we're<00:02:14.990> literally<00:02:15.290> at<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.770> end<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
tore we're literally at the end of the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.600 
tore we're literally at the end of the
level

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
level

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.430 
level
there<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.420> there<00:02:17.690> isn't<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.110> checkpoint

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
there really is there isn't a checkpoint

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.030 
there really is there isn't a checkpoint
so<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.880> can't<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:20.600> tell<00:02:20.960> because<00:02:21.680> they

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
so you can't really tell because they

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.550 
so you can't really tell because they
remove<00:02:22.730> checkpoints<00:02:23.510> for<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:24.170> beginning<00:02:24.440> of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
remove checkpoints for the beginning of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.550 
remove checkpoints for the beginning of
the<00:02:24.680> game<00:02:25.090> or<00:02:26.090> sounds<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.570> thus<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the game or sounds like thus the the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.680 
the game or sounds like thus the the
middle<00:02:28.040> worlds<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.490> guess<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.030> don't<00:02:29.180> know<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
middle worlds I guess I don't know I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.990 
middle worlds I guess I don't know I
don't<00:02:30.410> even<00:02:30.500> know<00:02:30.710> if<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:30.890> lot<00:02:31.460> or<00:02:31.640> if<00:02:31.790> this

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
don't even know if this lot or if this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.220 
don't even know if this lot or if this
the<00:02:32.300> special<00:02:32.540> world<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.900> even<00:02:33.080> half

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
the special world is even half

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.160 
the special world is even half
checkpoint<00:02:34.090> okay<00:02:35.090> finally<00:02:35.630> got<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> last

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
checkpoint okay finally got the last

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
from here and thirty seconds on the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.820 
from here and thirty seconds on the
clock<00:02:41.480> hopefully<00:02:41.870> I'll<00:02:42.020> we<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.290> rule<00:02:42.560> they

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
clock hopefully I'll we not rule they

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.950 
clock hopefully I'll we not rule they
put<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.190> 106<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> end<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.570> way<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
guaranteed to make it that's good that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.230 
guaranteed to make it that's good that
is<00:02:47.930> really<00:02:48.410> really<00:02:48.530> good<00:02:48.710> actually
