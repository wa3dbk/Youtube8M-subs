zinc chart so the first let's go live to

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:44.440 
zinc chart so the first let's go live to
zinc<00:00:25.029> sure

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.820 

and<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:45.320> site<00:00:45.500> loads<00:00:45.740> up<00:00:45.920> as<00:00:46.100> you'd<00:00:46.280> expect

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
and the site loads up as you'd expect

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.230 
and the site loads up as you'd expect
nothing<00:00:48.830> too<00:00:48.980> interesting<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.880> home<00:00:50.030> page

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
nothing too interesting on the home page

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.970 
nothing too interesting on the home page
that's<00:00:50.540> flash<00:00:50.870> based<00:00:51.140> or<00:00:51.410> anything<00:00:51.800> it's

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
that's flash based or anything it's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.280 
that's flash based or anything it's
mostly<00:00:52.520> a<00:00:52.610> bunch<00:00:52.790> of<00:00:52.880> jQuery<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:53.930> on<00:00:54.080> but

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
mostly a bunch of jQuery and so on but

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.830 
mostly a bunch of jQuery and so on but
if<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.440> pull<00:00:54.710> up<00:00:54.830> one<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.310> these<00:00:55.400> charts<00:00:58.840> you

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
if we pull up one of these charts you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.410 
if we pull up one of these charts you
will<00:00:59.990> see<00:01:00.170> indeed<00:01:00.610> flash<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.910> live<00:01:02.150> and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
will see indeed flash is live and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.900 
will see indeed flash is live and
available<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.110> there<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:03.830> a<00:01:03.860> radar<00:01:04.339> chart<00:01:04.760> in

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910

flash<00:01:07.300> more<00:01:08.300> of<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.450> problems<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.840> we've

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
flash more of the problems that we've

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.070 
flash more of the problems that we've
encountered<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:09.680> far<00:01:09.710> we're<00:01:10.070> playing<00:01:10.400> with

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
encountered so far we're playing with

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.440 
encountered so far we're playing with
with<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.290> nexus<00:01:12.950> one<00:01:13.130> phone<00:01:13.160> has<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.180> little

with the nexus one phone has a little

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.330 
with the nexus one phone has a little
bit<00:01:14.570> more<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.900> do<00:01:15.110> not<00:01:15.380> with<00:01:15.590> flash<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:15.950> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
bit more to do not with flash and the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.880 
bit more to do not with flash and the
interactivity<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:16.940> sizing<00:01:17.540> issues<00:01:17.930> in

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
interactivity with sizing issues in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.890 
interactivity with sizing issues in
terms<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.520> being<00:01:19.729> able<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.000> touch<00:01:20.270> various

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
objects on websites that are really not

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.620 
objects on websites that are really not
developed<00:01:23.000> for<00:01:23.860> fingers<00:01:24.860> here's<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.280> piano

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
developed for fingers here's a piano

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.380 
developed for fingers here's a piano
running<00:01:26.630> flash<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:30.759> we<00:01:31.759> haven't<00:01:32.030> seen<00:01:32.180> any

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
running flash and we haven't seen any

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.630 
running flash and we haven't seen any
major<00:01:32.900> problems<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.619> terms<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:34.100> performance

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
major problems in terms of performance

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.620 
major problems in terms of performance
crashing<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:35.780> far<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.850> can<00:01:38.000> see<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.300> renders

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
crashing so far you can see it renders

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.300 
crashing so far you can see it renders
the<00:01:38.869> once<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.350> flash<00:01:39.560> player<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:39.860> loaded<00:01:40.190> it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the once the flash player is loaded it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.190 
the once the flash player is loaded it
renders<00:01:40.640> quite<00:01:40.880> quickly

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.920 

so<00:01:48.860> after<00:01:49.460> we<00:01:50.149> take<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.360> look<00:01:50.479> at<00:01:50.630> one<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
so after we take a look at one of the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.639 
so after we take a look at one of the
more<00:01:51.079> complicated<00:01:51.409> ones<00:01:51.829> here<00:01:52.039> in<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.189> second

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
more complicated ones here in a second

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.899 
more complicated ones here in a second
so<00:01:55.659> as<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.780> can<00:01:56.899> see<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.039> problem<00:01:58.369> big

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so as you can see more of a problem big

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.620 
so as you can see more of a problem big
fat<00:01:59.149> fingers<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.780> in<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:02.420> maybe

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
fat fingers and in and out here maybe

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.819 
fat fingers and in and out here maybe
would<00:02:02.780> take<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:02.990> look<00:02:03.140> at<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.350> coffee<00:02:03.530> cup

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
would take a look at the coffee cup

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.210 
would take a look at the coffee cup
example<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.740> see<00:02:06.860> something<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.130> little

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
example you can see something a little

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.880 
example you can see something a little
bit<00:02:07.369> more<00:02:07.520> complex<00:02:07.909> with<00:02:08.149> animation<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
bit more complex with animation and the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.550 
bit more complex with animation and the
tool<00:02:10.099> tips<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.519> things<00:02:10.550> do<00:02:10.940> work<00:02:11.239> but<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
tool tips and things do work but the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.410 
tool tips and things do work but the
kind<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> common<00:02:13.340> criticism<00:02:13.880> against<00:02:14.120> flash

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
kind of common criticism against flash

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710 
kind of common criticism against flash
is<00:02:14.959> really<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:16.000> terribly<00:02:17.000> realistic<00:02:17.599> it

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
is really not terribly realistic it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.970 
is really not terribly realistic it
seems<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.530> general<00:02:18.799> criticism

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
seems to be just a general criticism

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.479 
seems to be just a general criticism
we're<00:02:19.489> seeing<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:19.879> touch-based<00:02:20.150> interfaces

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489

we're seeing with touch-based interfaces

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
somewhat awkward just because of the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.120 
somewhat awkward just because of the

indeed<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:38.329> html5<00:02:38.660> version<00:02:39.140> renders<00:02:40.130> more

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
indeed the html5 version renders more

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.830 
indeed the html5 version renders more
quickly<00:02:40.579> initially<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.569> don't<00:02:41.720> have

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
quickly initially because you don't have

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.210 
quickly initially because you don't have
to<00:02:42.019> have<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.840> plugin<00:02:44.840> load<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.349> time<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.829> so

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
to have the plugin load up time and so

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.259 
to have the plugin load up time and so
you'll<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:46.940> here<00:02:48.280> all<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.579> charts<00:02:49.910> running

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
you'll see here all the charts running

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.160 
you'll see here all the charts running
side-by-side<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:52.549> fine<00:02:52.819> but<00:02:53.780> what<00:02:54.019> our

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
side-by-side just fine but what our

upcoming performance data is going to

flash player typically has an too much

compatibility<00:03:28.700> page<00:03:28.940> let's<00:03:29.840> go<00:03:29.930> ahead<00:03:30.019> and

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
compatibility page let's go ahead and

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.539 
compatibility page let's go ahead and
run<00:03:30.260> some<00:03:30.440> speed<00:03:30.709> tests<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.220> see<00:03:31.340> what<00:03:31.489> it

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
run some speed tests and see what it

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.720 
run some speed tests and see what it
looks<00:03:31.700> like<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.099> first<00:03:34.459> hundred

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
looks like just do the first hundred

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.640 
looks like just do the first hundred
point<00:03:35.060> one

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.780 

so<00:03:40.650> let's<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.220> what<00:03:41.370> does<00:03:41.460> that<00:03:41.580> look<00:03:41.730> like

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
so let's see what does that look like

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.850 
so let's see what does that look like
there

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.600 

oh<00:03:49.000> wow<00:03:50.000> three<00:03:50.960> seconds<00:03:51.410> versus<00:03:51.860> nine<00:03:52.070> seconds

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
oh wow three seconds versus nine seconds

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.870 
oh wow three seconds versus nine seconds
so<00:03:52.700> that's<00:03:52.910> kind<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.120> interesting<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.760> not

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
so that's kind of interesting it's not

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.840 
so that's kind of interesting it's not
suggesting<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.980> html5<00:03:57.980> version<00:03:58.490> will

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
suggesting that the html5 version will

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:09.300 
suggesting that the html5 version will
slower

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.430 

and<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:10.450> one<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:11.200> very<00:04:11.940> similar<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.440> 3.9

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
and this one is very similar so 3.9

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.310 
and this one is very similar so 3.9
versus<00:04:14.890> 3.2<00:04:15.870> 4000<00:04:16.870> points<00:04:17.019> let's<00:04:17.799> try<00:04:19.320> three

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
versus 3.2 4000 points let's try three

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.610 
versus 3.2 4000 points let's try three
series<00:04:21.960> thousand<00:04:22.960> points<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.350> should<00:04:23.500> be

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
series thousand points it should be

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.980 
series thousand points it should be
relatively<00:04:23.980> slow

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.260 

five<00:04:33.800> seconds<00:04:34.370> for<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.610> fight<00:04:34.820> almost<00:04:34.970> six

it's<00:05:14.660> made<00:05:14.930> for<00:05:15.650> performance<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.400> let's<00:05:16.670> take

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
it's made for performance so let's take

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.650 
it's made for performance so let's take
a<00:05:16.850> look<00:05:17.090> here<00:05:17.120> at<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:19.040> rendering<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:20.420> the

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
a look here at the rendering of the

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.450 
a look here at the rendering of the
excessive<00:05:21.110> bar<00:05:21.410> chart<00:05:21.680> example<00:05:22.130> so<00:05:22.340> we've

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
excessive bar chart example so we've

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:32.619 
excessive bar chart example so we've
seen<00:05:22.610> nine<00:05:22.820> seconds<00:05:23.330> on<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.450> flash

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:40.800 

and<00:05:33.629> this<00:05:33.900> is<00:05:34.020> taking<00:05:34.259> a<00:05:34.319> bit<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.500> time

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.900 

so<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:41.840> would<00:05:42.260> say<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:43.280> looks<00:05:43.460> like<00:05:43.550> html5

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
so I would say that it looks like html5

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.810 
so I would say that it looks like html5
here<00:05:44.510> is<00:05:44.660> losing<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.770> source<00:05:46.010> of<00:05:46.160> 20<00:05:46.430> seconds

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
here is losing a source of 20 seconds

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.460 
here is losing a source of 20 seconds
this<00:05:46.910> is<00:05:47.030> exactly<00:05:47.330> what<00:05:47.600> we<00:05:47.690> see<00:05:47.870> them<00:05:47.960> data

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
this is exactly what we see them data

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.490 
this is exactly what we see them data
collected<00:05:49.100> online<00:05:49.520> with<00:05:50.480> mostly<00:05:50.750> PC<00:05:51.140> users

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
and Mac users who've done things as you

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.250 
and Mac users who've done things as you
hit<00:05:53.630> large-scale<00:05:54.700> HTML<00:05:55.700> really<00:05:56.090> html5<00:05:57.050> canvas

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
hit large-scale HTML really html5 canvas

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.350 
hit large-scale HTML really html5 canvas
really<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:57.950> just<00:05:58.160> not<00:05:58.760> cut<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.090> are

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
really just just not cut it are

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.100 
really just just not cut it are
particularly<00:05:59.780> if<00:05:59.870> it's<00:05:59.990> interactive<00:06:02.110> so

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
particularly if it's interactive so

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.720 
particularly if it's interactive so
finally<00:06:03.560> let's<00:06:03.710> just<00:06:03.980> wrap<00:06:04.130> up<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.520> show<00:06:04.670> you

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
finally let's just wrap up and show you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.960 
finally let's just wrap up and show you
again<00:06:05.270> few<00:06:05.720> more<00:06:05.870> side<00:06:06.110> by<00:06:06.260> side<00:06:06.470> features<00:06:06.890> and

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.990 

here<00:06:13.970> is<00:06:14.060> an<00:06:14.420> example<00:06:14.510> of<00:06:14.930> say<00:06:15.440> guides<00:06:16.000> and

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
here is an example of say guides and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.190 
here is an example of say guides and
flash<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:20.570> you<00:06:20.660> can<00:06:20.750> see<00:06:20.870> some<00:06:21.020> of<00:06:21.050> the

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
flash so you can see some of the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.160 
flash so you can see some of the
awkwardness<00:06:21.680> of<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:22.160> touch<00:06:22.850> interface<00:06:23.170> so

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
awkwardness of the touch interface so

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.380 
awkwardness of the touch interface so
you<00:06:24.260> can<00:06:24.440> see<00:06:24.590> there's<00:06:24.800> a<00:06:24.860> guideline<00:06:25.580> have<00:06:26.240> to

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
you can see there's a guideline have to

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.270 
you can see there's a guideline have to
click<00:06:26.930> so<00:06:27.260> there's<00:06:27.500> no<00:06:27.620> sense<00:06:27.830> of<00:06:27.920> hovering

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
click so there's no sense of hovering

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.310 
click so there's no sense of hovering
obviously<00:06:28.880> because<00:06:29.840> you're<00:06:29.990> using<00:06:30.110> your

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
obviously because you're using your

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.530 
obviously because you're using your
finger<00:06:32.830> but<00:06:33.830> it<00:06:34.010> does<00:06:34.220> have<00:06:34.880> a<00:06:34.910> sense<00:06:35.270> of<00:06:35.390> being

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
finger but it does have a sense of being

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.360 
finger but it does have a sense of being
able<00:06:35.660> to<00:06:35.780> drag<00:06:36.050> your<00:06:36.230> finger<00:06:36.380> across<00:06:36.620> very

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
able to drag your finger across very

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:53.340 
able to drag your finger across very
similar<00:06:37.760> to<00:06:37.870> mouse<00:06:38.870> how<00:06:39.140> about<00:06:39.290> a<00:06:39.320> zoom<00:06:39.530> scroll

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.780 

you<00:06:53.920> should<00:06:54.280> be<00:06:54.370> able<00:06:54.460> to<00:06:54.610> click<00:06:55.000> and<00:06:55.150> drag

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
you should be able to click and drag

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.370 
you should be able to click and drag
there's<00:06:57.790> there's<00:06:58.150> a<00:06:58.270> guide<00:06:58.510> showing<00:06:58.810> up<00:06:59.050> and<00:06:59.230> I

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
there's there's a guide showing up and I

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.750 
there's there's a guide showing up and I
should<00:06:59.650> be<00:06:59.740> able<00:06:59.800> to<00:07:00.010> create<00:07:00.580> a<00:07:01.800> region<00:07:02.800> now

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
should be able to create a region now

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.730 
should be able to create a region now
obviously<00:07:04.300> it<00:07:04.510> might<00:07:04.690> be<00:07:04.810> better<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.170> have<00:07:05.680> a

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
obviously it might be better to have a

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.470 
obviously it might be better to have a
pinch<00:07:06.690> style<00:07:07.690> but<00:07:08.680> there's<00:07:09.280> a<00:07:09.580> region<00:07:10.030> created

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
pinch style but there's a region created

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.350 
pinch style but there's a region created
and<00:07:10.630> we<00:07:10.660> should<00:07:11.110> field<00:07:11.290> as<00:07:11.560> it<00:07:11.620> and<00:07:12.360> finally

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
and we should field as it and finally

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.170 
and we should field as it and finally
just<00:07:13.810> to<00:07:13.960> show<00:07:14.500> off<00:07:14.530> that<00:07:14.740> you<00:07:15.340> can<00:07:15.520> do<00:07:15.670> more

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
just to show off that you can do more

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.240 
just to show off that you can do more
