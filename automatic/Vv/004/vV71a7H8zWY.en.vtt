00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.150
 good 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.380
 looking on the internet 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.889
 filters to give you more camera and 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.889
 well then 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:22.480
 euros more for ebay 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.480
 and I bought a 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.689
 counter for light 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.689
 Y 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.520
 adapters for different 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 diameters 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.670
 we go 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.670
 for all the all 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.030
 and I liked it 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.840
 66 euros 15 euros with free shipping without 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.840
 customs nothing 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 and this is bought as a seller 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.600
 will buy you also not 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.870
 and these filters as well for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.870
 control 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.200
 17 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 6 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.710
 of d 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.710
 degraded 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.409
 and the truth is that I do not know 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.900
 five euros that they will not have the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.120
 quality 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.120
 sexy of the filters link but good 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.039
 for the day to day 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.369
 and nothing we will see how they are left 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.369
 in the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 in the camera 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.300
 place the degrees a dream 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 installed 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.710
 and nothing we are going to put an end to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.550
 how is it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.360
 the filter is on 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.080
 the truth is that for to put better 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.060
 that is related outside the camera and 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.340
 do a little pressure 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.340
 it will be super good we are moving 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.080
 Regulate them to go down to see 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.370
 this is this normal 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.190
 top post 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.870

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.750
 water or what we want 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.750
 and nothing these are the filters 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.000
 well the infinities come with 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.830
 Interest with degraded and normal liters 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.770

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.580

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.360
 questions about the filters in the 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.360
 comments below nothing
