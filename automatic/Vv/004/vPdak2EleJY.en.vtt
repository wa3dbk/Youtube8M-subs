00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.000
 hi girls hello to everyone then 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.490
 I have not explained to you in the last video 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.289
 how do you close the meshes 1 beyond 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.610
 that we work the irons but what I believe 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.330
 fundamental and therefore I am 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.430
 Forgot 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.280
 I'll explain it to you in this little little one 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.390
 video then we have to be with iron 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:33.260
 on the left side where we did 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.289
 let's see if you zoom in a little bit where 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.290
 we took the last turn at this 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:42.320
 point we have to start closing 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.370
 we take our thread in the part 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 right then I go to lock the wire 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.300
 tied to the skein and I make a one 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.110
 straight mesh then I insert the iron 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.480
 right under the left one I do 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.040
 pass the thread 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.020
 I take it out and knit it alone a 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.600
 this point I have to put another one 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.780
 always the right iron under that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.729
 left I pass the thread 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.799
 I make him go out and lunch his shirt a 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.320
 this point before proceeding 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.840
 I have to do this way to take the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.950
 I insert the left iron into the first one 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.010
 knit this way this way 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.640
 from the left side towards the part 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:45.200
 right from bottom to top I find myself 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:50.119
 so I take this shirt and I have to 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.439
 let the iron pass with the foresight 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.439
 not to let the next one come out 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.740
 here I am 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 and I closed the first shirt I do it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:09.789
 review I make a shirt is entitled 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.860
 release the shirt then take the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.860
 wire takes the iron apple tree I modify a 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.000
 they catch and I take with the left iron 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.010
 the last shirt 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.060
 the first starting from mine of mine 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.340
 I take his arm and I have to let it pass 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.880
 from the iron with the foresight of not 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 unhook the last shirt 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 I'll review it is an operation 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.550
 quite uncomplicated it has more than that 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.070
 other you have to position this iron 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.450
 a position that can take the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.330
 knit and to be able to work on it 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.160
 way 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.930
 do this operation see that we are 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.330
 starting to close and do this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.150
 operation and keep all the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.739
 very very slow processing because 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.209
 will tend to and will tend to tighten 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.920
 a little bit the shirts therefore not 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.480
 I wish maybe you get one 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.090
 workmanship all pretty wide then 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.790
 arrived here and it is very small there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.470
 I review one last time so 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.459
 I take the right shirt and insert it 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.670
 I insert the right iron under the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.950
 left I pass the thread I go 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.160
 above and release the shirt when I have it 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.480
 two on the iron this little iron around 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.440
 just take the left iron I take 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.959
 this shirt the first closer to the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.670
 my hand and I have to pass it on to 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.660
 above the other then I do it 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.959
 so unhook from the iron so that I have 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.150
 only the last one I made 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.510
 I hope this little tutorial eno 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.489
 is clear and therefore we say you can give 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.109
 life to all your creations this 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.910
 is the way for the method to close the 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.650
 knit any type of knit you 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 you have done the right and backhand le 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.570
 coast the patterned point, etc. 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.610
 etc. this is always the way in which 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.940
 to be able to close them very easily 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.160
 I hope everything was clear and 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.160
 of your comments to you soon total
