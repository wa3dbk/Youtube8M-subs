00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello to all these ultras 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.830
 phishing and today we end up 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.900
 with its beautiful sunsets at 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.970
 waterfront so I'm like 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.140
 usually in 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.330
 so already I wanted to apologize for my 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.880
 inactivity on the channel for some 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.950
 month it was winter but I did not get 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.050
 too much fishing time or a lot of 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.630
 motivation so here is today 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.510
 we find ourselves at the edge of a pond so 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.180
 in this little spot that I like so 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.850
 here to a lot of fat guys including 2 and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.230
 little cafe makes a small and big this gift 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.900
 who as you can see it's 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.910
 between two small pink bands under a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.640
 London tree 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.330
 there are a lot of branches at the bottom 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 many waves so they carp 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.629
 often here mostly 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.260
 so here I go fishing with 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.839
 small toss of the little ones with so 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.269
 simple montages as usual 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.970
 plugs not too big so small 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.310
 son and I'm going fishing as usual 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.479
 in green and van den yih I decided to 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.250
 to test something so I like colleagues at 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.049
 soft lures for big roach and 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 that it worked pretty well so he 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.630
 dull teaches me these soft lures so 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.300
 this one and I'll see if his death that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.180
 walk pretty well in angola so I 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.250
 fishing 50 cm deep not much more 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.720
 it's not very deep here so here we go 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.580
 so I'm going to put my canes in the water 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.050
 and I'll call you back to the first 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.830
 fish immediately 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.140
 so that's the first fish so as I 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.020
 really expected me but a little 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.070
 guys whose soft lure fishing 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.390
 so it's really small bed really 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.530
 pro big but hey I expected 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.270
 really not fishing we keep the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.830
 soup tonight so I'm pretty 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.180
 glad we go quickly dropped them in the water 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.500
 so here at home not that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.440
 worked well their soup for them 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.810
 keep it but what I see it looks 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.560
 to be not too bad so here is the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.509
 technique that I really brought back everything 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.340
 gently gently gently with 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.319
 a very small soft lures of 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 preference and you will see that it 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.010
 too bad market 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.420
 So here I do a little remake 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.650
 ellipses and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.950
 I will remind you to push same fish 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.980
 right now so here's another 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.270
 little catch but this time in the cap 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.050
 so a small carpeaux well pretty 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:41.890
 so we will release them 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:43.510
 the second excuse me so excuse me 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.440
 for video quality but I'm filming 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.380
 with a cell phone here we will try to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:57.489
 not to fall into the water so that's me 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.489
 we will release these little animals in 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.280
 sweetness so here is so given that 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.100
 it's starting to get a little dark here I 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.700
 will stop the session so here is so 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.830
 review the half-hour session 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.230
 a small carpels yet I understand 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.660
 I did not have many keys but 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.500
 all the time and crochet so parry on 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.950
 will do better next time 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.400
