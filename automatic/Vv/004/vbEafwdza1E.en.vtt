survey like this for a number of reasons

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.499 
survey like this for a number of reasons
the<00:00:29.219> first<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.610> just<00:00:29.820> having<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.300> accurate

occur our distribution of biodiversity

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.569 
occur our distribution of biodiversity
and<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.420> particularly<00:00:37.250> critical<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and that's particularly critical in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
and that's particularly critical in
terms<00:00:38.789> of<00:00:38.969> preventing<00:00:39.239> future<00:00:39.539> extinctions

so once you know what's out there to
protect<00:00:42.990> you<00:00:43.470> can<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.740> make<00:00:43.950> smart

I already want to focus on three
different<00:01:15.390> island<00:01:15.870> systems<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> first

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
different island systems and the first

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
different island systems and the first
islands<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> Seychelles<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:20.340> have

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
islands were the Seychelles which have

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.390 
islands were the Seychelles which have

one of the more poorly known reptiles in
the<00:01:27.000> Seychelles<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> chameleon<00:01:28.860> which

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the Seychelles is the chameleon which

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.770 
the Seychelles is the chameleon which
occurs<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.450> chameleon

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
occurs there the first chameleon

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
occurs there the first chameleon
specimens<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.500> were<00:01:31.830> collected<00:01:32.760> from<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
specimens that were collected from the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
specimens that were collected from the
Seychelles<00:01:33.570> were<00:01:34.290> described<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.920> two

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
Seychelles were described as two

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.700 
Seychelles were described as two
separate<00:01:35.490> species<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:36.840> SAR<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> last

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
separate species that SAR for the last

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910 
separate species that SAR for the last
almost<00:01:38.700> 200<00:01:39.270> years<00:01:39.470> they've<00:01:40.470> always<00:01:40.680> been

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
almost 200 years they've always been

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
almost 200 years they've always been
assumed<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> single<00:01:41.850> species<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.630> now

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
assumed to be a single species we now

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.390 
assumed to be a single species we now
know<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.260> genetic<00:01:43.619> data<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.220> there

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
know from the genetic data that there

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.370 
know from the genetic data that there
are<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.760> fact<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:45.150> are<00:01:45.180> two<00:01:45.390> species<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
are in fact there are two species so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
are in fact there are two species so
essentially<00:01:47.360> these<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.720> descriptions

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
essentially these first descriptions

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.899 
essentially these first descriptions
were<00:01:49.530> made<00:01:49.710> 200<00:01:50.159> years<00:01:50.340> ago<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.700> actually

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
were made 200 years ago we're actually

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.350 
were made 200 years ago we're actually
correct

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
correct

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
correct
so<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.960> New<00:01:52.200> Yorkers<00:01:52.500> survey<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.070> really

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so this New Yorkers survey was really

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
so this New Yorkers survey was really
designed<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.090> take<00:01:54.659> us<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> critical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
designed to take us to the critical

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
designed to take us to the critical
islands<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.100> nailing<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
islands really nailing down the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
islands really nailing down the
distribution<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> these<00:01:57.570> two<00:01:57.810> species<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.530> was

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
looking for chameleons in the case of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.110 
looking for chameleons in the case of
silhouette<00:02:23.860> what<00:02:24.070> was<00:02:24.220> really<00:02:24.520> fun<00:02:24.700> about<00:02:24.730> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
silhouette what was really fun about it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.690 
silhouette what was really fun about it
was<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> chameleons<00:02:27.310> were<00:02:27.370> there

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
was that the chameleons were there

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.230 
was that the chameleons were there
they're<00:02:27.970> actually<00:02:28.110> healthy<00:02:29.110> populations<00:02:29.740> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
they're actually healthy populations and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.690 
they're actually healthy populations and
I<00:02:31.240> think<00:02:31.630> over<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> course<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.530> three<00:02:33.490> nights

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
I think over the course of three nights

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.080 
I think over the course of three nights
we<00:02:34.420> recorded<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.920> order<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.580> 30<00:02:36.850> to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
we recorded in the order of like 30 to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.630 
we recorded in the order of like 30 to
40<00:02:37.480> unit<00:02:37.750> animals<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.040> after<00:02:39.310> around

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
40 unit animals so after around

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.110 
silhouettes
we<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.770> took<00:02:42.160> on<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.460> few<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
we then took on the few like the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.030 
we then took on the few like the
high-risk<00:02:43.660> part<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.350> expedition<00:02:44.890> which

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
high-risk part of the expedition which

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.160 
high-risk part of the expedition which
was<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> survey<00:02:45.760> islands<00:02:46.390> where<00:02:46.630> comedians

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
was to survey islands where comedians

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.860 
was to survey islands where comedians
had<00:02:47.590> never<00:02:47.800> been<00:02:47.980> found<00:02:48.220> before<00:02:48.460> or<00:02:48.940> where

there were museum records that were very

there were museum records that were very

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
one of the things about biodiversity is

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.530 
one of the things about biodiversity is
that<00:02:57.100> surface<00:02:57.460> area<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.850> good<00:02:58.060> predictor<00:02:58.480> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
that surface area is a good predictor of

we<00:06:12.090> found<00:06:12.390> things<00:06:12.540> like<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.990> endemic<00:06:13.260> FL<00:06:13.830> suma

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
we found things like the endemic FL suma

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.730 
we found things like the endemic FL suma
gecko<00:06:14.460> on<00:06:14.820> the<00:06:15.270> island<00:06:15.630> but<00:06:16.200> we<00:06:16.320> were<00:06:16.410> really

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
gecko on the island but we were really

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.860 
gecko on the island but we were really
hoping<00:06:17.190> that<00:06:17.400> we<00:06:17.610> might<00:06:17.790> find<00:06:18.060> skinks<00:06:18.630> all

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
hoping that we might find skinks all

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.440 
hoping that we might find skinks all
these<00:06:19.110> knack<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.740> state<00:06:20.160> geckos<00:06:20.550> but<00:06:21.330> we

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
these knack to state geckos but we

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.570 
these knack to state geckos but we
didn't<00:06:21.630> find<00:06:21.810> any<00:06:21.990> populations<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:23.190> surveys

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
didn't find any populations the surveys

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.850 
didn't find any populations the surveys
really<00:06:24.530> provided<00:06:25.530> a<00:06:25.560> lot<00:06:25.680> more<00:06:25.710> information

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
really provided a lot more information

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.530 
really provided a lot more information
now<00:06:26.990> about<00:06:27.990> what<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.470> situation<00:06:28.980> is<00:06:29.130> for<00:06:29.540> for

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
now about what the situation is for for

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.790 
now about what the situation is for for
these<00:06:30.630> different<00:06:30.930> islands<00:06:31.320> that<00:06:31.590> has

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
these different islands that has

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.880 
these different islands that has
important<00:06:32.310> implications<00:06:32.490> for<00:06:33.890> conserving

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
important implications for conserving

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.760 
important implications for conserving
those<00:06:35.070> species<00:06:35.600> and<00:06:36.600> of<00:06:36.750> course<00:06:36.930> allows<00:06:37.380> us<00:06:37.440> to

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
those species and of course allows us to

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.560 
those species and of course allows us to
then<00:06:37.890> think<00:06:38.190> about<00:06:38.460> moving<00:06:38.970> on<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.360> next

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
then think about moving on to the next

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:58.999 
then think about moving on to the next
step

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.069
