00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
way they won't fix it so it has to be

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.750 
way they won't fix it so it has to be
about<00:03:18.820> one<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.540> half<00:03:19.570> inch<00:03:20.019> away<00:03:20.410> from<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
about one and a half inch away from so I

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.470 
about one and a half inch away from so I
hope<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.540> video<00:03:22.810> helped<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.480> another

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
which I'm not suggesting but I have

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.090 
which I'm not suggesting but I have
heard<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.780> some<00:04:01.959> people<00:04:02.290> put<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.709> oven

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
heard that some people put in the oven

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.740 
heard that some people put in the oven
just<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.519> bottom<00:04:03.670> once<00:04:03.970> happening<00:04:04.569> and

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
just in the bottom once happening and

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.440 
just in the bottom once happening and
they<00:04:05.319> put<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.709> there<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.609> then<00:04:06.940> when<00:04:07.120> they<00:04:07.299> got

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
they put it there and then when they got

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.479 
they put it there and then when they got
it<00:04:07.630> out<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:08.079> was<00:04:08.350> in<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.799> perfect<00:04:09.010> upright

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
it out it was in a perfect upright

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.600 
it out it was in a perfect upright
position<00:04:09.940> so

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
position so

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.700 
position so
the<00:04:10.760> bottom<00:04:11.030> line<00:04:11.240> is<00:04:11.480> heat<00:04:11.900> when<00:04:12.350> heat<00:04:12.680> is

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
the bottom line is heat when heat is

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.030 
the bottom line is heat when heat is
applied<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.120> fourth<00:04:14.420> lock<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.530> strap

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
applied to the fourth lock to the strap

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.069 
applied to the fourth lock to the strap
