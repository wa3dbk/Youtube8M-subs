the<00:00:51.420> design<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the design of it and all that but then I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
the design of it and all that but then I
just<00:00:54.000> decided<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.629> can't<00:00:55.050> take<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.739> too

and just so much fun so let's take a
look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> driving<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
look at it driving a little bit this is

hobbies in Union City California and as
you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.200> low<00:01:10.560> C<00:01:10.799> micro<00:01:11.280> SCT<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.180> just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you can see the low C micro SCT is just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.820 
you can see the low C micro SCT is just
so<00:01:13.350> small<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.270> driving<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.470> ant

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
so small it's like driving around an ant

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
so small it's like driving around an ant
but<00:01:17.250> even<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.299> tiny<00:01:18.630> size<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.470> very

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but even so for that tiny size it's very

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
but even so for that tiny size it's very
stable<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> box

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
stable and this is right out of the box

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
stable and this is right out of the box
no<00:01:22.680> modifications<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.790> tuning<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> it

whatsoever<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.610> wide

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
whatsoever it's actually a very wide

whatsoever it's actually a very wide
vehicle<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.170> its<00:01:28.290> size<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.340> gives<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
vehicle for its size which gives it a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
vehicle for its size which gives it a
lot<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> stability<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> independent

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
lot of stability and that independent

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
lot of stability and that independent
suspension<00:01:31.979> hopefully<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:33.030> soak<00:01:33.360> up

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
suspension hopefully to really soak up

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.410 
suspension hopefully to really soak up
the<00:01:33.689> bumps<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> terrain<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.270> like<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> say

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the bumps in the terrain and like I say

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
the bumps in the terrain and like I say
it's<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.320> stable<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.909> fun

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's just very stable and just very fun

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's just very stable and just very fun
to<00:01:39.360> drive<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.780> goes<00:01:40.020> where<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to drive it goes where you want it to go

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that it has gives it great traction even

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.399 
that it has gives it great traction even

you can see the speed out of the box is
very<00:01:51.960> good<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> size<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> vehicle<00:01:54.210> if

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
very good for the size of the vehicle if

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.880

you're going to compare the outright

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.120 
you're going to compare the outright
speed<00:01:56.130> versus<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> 1/10<00:01:57.990> scale<00:01:58.140> vehicle<00:01:58.890> let's

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
installing a full brushless system it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.440 
installing a full brushless system it
uses<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.800> same<00:02:46.010> brushless<00:02:46.400> motor<00:02:46.820> system<00:02:46.940> as

uses the same brushless motor system as

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.400 
uses the same brushless motor system as
the<00:02:48.170> micro<00:02:48.920> tee<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.420> truck<00:02:50.780> does<00:02:51.080> have<00:02:51.380> a

5<00:02:52.010> wire<00:02:52.400> servo<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.570> would<00:02:53.810> have<00:02:53.959> to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
5 wire servo in it so you would have to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.210 
5 wire servo in it so you would have to
replace<00:02:54.260> servo<00:02:55.220> receiver<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.380> speed

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
replace servo receiver and the speed

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220 
replace servo receiver and the speed
control<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.209> motor<00:02:59.420> that's<00:03:00.020> going<00:03:00.170> to

control and the motor that's going to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.650 
control and the motor that's going to
cost<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.620> about<00:03:00.709> another<00:03:01.070> hundred<00:03:01.310> bucks

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
cost you about another hundred bucks

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.780 
cost you about another hundred bucks
considering<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.110> low<00:03:03.290> C<00:03:03.470> micro<00:03:04.130> SCT

my<00:03:12.500> recommendation<00:03:13.400> take<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.150> out<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.480> box

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
my recommendation take it out of the box

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.259 
my recommendation take it out of the box
have<00:03:15.470> some<00:03:15.739> fun<00:03:15.980> with<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.280> it's<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.940> great

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
have some fun with it it's a great

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.900 
have some fun with it it's a great
little<00:03:17.480> truck<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.410> handles<00:03:18.860> very<00:03:18.920> well<00:03:19.220> just

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910

as it is and if it's not enough speed
for<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.489> pick<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.330> light<00:03:23.510> bulb<00:03:23.690> pack<00:03:23.930> and
