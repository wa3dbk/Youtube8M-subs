00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.520 
door panels you name it it's all covered
it<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.700> leather<00:02:06.320> what<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.440> be

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it and that's not leather what will be

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.260 
it and that's not leather what will be
the<00:02:07.649> zero<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.039> sixty<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> car<00:02:08.880> we

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the zero to sixty we in this car we

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
the zero to sixty we in this car we
actually<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.989> put<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> track

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
actually have not put it on the track

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
actually have not put it on the track
yet<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.720> guess<00:02:12.900> somewhere

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
yet to do but I would guess somewhere

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.410 
yet to do but I would guess somewhere
probably<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> four<00:02:14.040> second<00:02:14.400> range<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:15.209> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
probably in the four second range it's a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.080 
probably in the four second range it's a
the<00:02:15.810> top<00:02:16.020> speed<00:02:16.260> would<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.640> probably<00:02:17.640> close<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the top speed would be probably close to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.229 
the top speed would be probably close to
two<00:02:18.330> hundred<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.550> I'm<00:02:20.670> interested<00:02:20.970> in

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
two hundred and if I'm interested in

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.820 
two hundred and if I'm interested in
this<00:02:21.390> car<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.810> want<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.080> barn<00:02:22.290> what<00:02:22.530> would<00:02:22.709> be

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
this car if I want to barn what would be

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.900 
this car if I want to barn what would be
the<00:02:22.950> price<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.580> uh

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the price for it uh

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.850 
the price for it uh
this<00:02:24.330> part<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.780> you're<00:02:24.989> probably<00:02:25.170> right

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this part here you're probably right

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.259 
this part here you're probably right
about<00:02:25.920> one<00:02:26.280> hundred<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.730> half<00:02:26.880> or<00:02:27.120> so

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
about one hundred and a half or so

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.269 
about one hundred and a half or so
hundred<00:02:27.930> fifty<00:02:28.110> thousand<00:02:29.269> gt500
