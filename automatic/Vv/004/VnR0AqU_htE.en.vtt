00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
lot of money and effort behind it we

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.990 
lot of money and effort behind it we
wanted<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.070> part<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
wanted to be part of that at the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.859 
wanted to be part of that at the
beginning<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.229> grow<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.740> Lotus

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.740 

the<00:01:29.320> first<00:01:29.590> thing<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.240> good<00:01:31.390> one<00:01:31.539> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the first thing but it's a good one and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.319 
the first thing but it's a good one and
then<00:01:32.020> from<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.380> we<00:01:32.799> can<00:01:32.950> then<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.149> said

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
then from here we can then like it said

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.569 
then from here we can then like it said
before<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.170> develop<00:01:35.619> with<00:01:35.799> notice<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.189> grow

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
before to develop with notice to grow

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.429 
before to develop with notice to grow
with<00:01:36.759> loaders<00:01:37.149> take<00:01:37.810> care<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.109> some<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.319> their

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
with loaders take care of some of their

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.499 
with loaders take care of some of their
other<00:01:38.560> programs<00:01:38.829> as<00:01:39.340> our<00:01:39.549> team<00:01:39.819> take<00:01:40.090> care<00:01:40.390> of

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
other programs as our team take care of

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.539 
other programs as our team take care of
their<00:01:40.869> other<00:01:40.990> programs<00:01:41.259> that's<00:01:41.770> really<00:01:42.130> good

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
their other programs that's really good

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.910 
their other programs that's really good
I<00:01:42.670> think<00:01:43.299> access<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.560> Lotus

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I think access to the to the Lotus

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.399 
I think access to the to the Lotus
Engineering<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.729> Lotus<00:01:46.030> R&amp;D<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:47.049> in<00:01:47.200> fact

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
Engineering the Lotus R&amp;D and in fact

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.690 
Engineering the Lotus R&amp;D and in fact
the<00:01:47.500> largest<00:01:47.649> facilities<00:01:48.310> are<00:01:48.429> heavily

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the largest facilities are heavily

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.389 
the largest facilities are heavily
including<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.450> test<00:01:49.659> practical<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.350> all<00:01:51.250> of

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
including the test practical so all of

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.830 
including the test practical so all of
those<00:01:51.490> things<00:01:51.819> really<00:01:52.060> give<00:01:52.329> us<00:01:52.420> an<00:01:52.539> extra

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
those things really give us an extra

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.199 
those things really give us an extra
strength<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> Bowman<00:01:53.740> makes<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.729> sure

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
strength to the Bowman makes it sure

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.539 
strength to the Bowman makes it sure
that<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.539> could<00:01:55.689> deliver<00:01:55.899> what<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.140> do<00:01:56.549> racing

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
that we could deliver what we do racing

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.099 
that we could deliver what we do racing
so<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.700> have<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> good<00:01:58.390> understanding<00:01:58.509> if<00:01:59.079> you

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
so I have a good understanding if you

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.480 
so I have a good understanding if you
like<00:01:59.259> for<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.439> racing<00:01:59.770> from<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.100> driver's

adding<00:02:12.400> our<00:02:12.610> long-term<00:02:13.030> objective<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.750> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
adding our long-term objective is that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.619 
adding our long-term objective is that
we<00:02:14.620> want<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.860> represent<00:02:15.069> Lotus<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:16.060> level<00:02:16.299> I

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
we want to represent Lotus at level I

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.089 
we want to represent Lotus at level I

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
think I've always come from the school

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.740

world<00:02:18.459> Oh<00:02:18.549> something<00:02:18.879> looks<00:02:19.090> good<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.540> good

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
and I think the Aurora's are such a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280 
and I think the Aurora's are such a
pretty<00:02:21.220> car<00:02:21.579> he<00:02:22.150> absolutely<00:02:22.360> looked<00:02:22.810> right<00:02:23.049> as

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
pretty car he absolutely looked right as

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.319 
pretty car he absolutely looked right as
it<00:02:23.440> sits<00:02:23.650> there<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.849> know<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.150> got<00:02:25.299> a

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
it sits there now so you know we got a

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.850 
it sits there now so you know we got a
great<00:02:25.569> starting<00:02:25.989> point
