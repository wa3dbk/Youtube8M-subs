00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.630
 so for this recipe you go 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 tablespoons of milk of 510 liters 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 white rum gelatine 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 for the spoon cookies here the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 number all depends on the size of your 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 charlotte mold 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 tablespoons pear sugar and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.579
 200 g of dark chocolate started all 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.050
 simply by softening your two 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.399
 gelatin leaves by soaking them 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.190
 in a large volume of cold water 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.090
 for a few minutes 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.680
 during that time we are going to do 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 melt our chocolate in a bain marie and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 we will add the milk clauses 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 chocolate is sufficiently melted you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.920
 go get a pretty thick dough 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.630
 you can remove the pan from the fire 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 recover your gelatin sheets that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.970
 you will press to remove any 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.299
 water add it to chocolate and mix 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.560
 to simply melt it 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.110
 then clarified the eggs which 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 simply means to separate the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
 white of yellow we add white in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.210
 a small bowl and we will put the yellow 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 directly with our chocolate 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.560
 mix with our chocolate and go 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.750
 can pass the rest of the recipe on 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 will take care of our fresh cream 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.259
 here we need a fresh cream that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
 be fresh in a container 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.460
 also cold we're going up 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.960
 simply in whipped cream to give 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.820
 from unctuousness to our charlotte 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 then gradually incorporated the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 chocolate whipped cream so everything 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.649
 we'll just take a little bit of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
 whipped cream and a spatula we will 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 come make a circular motion from 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 to incorporate the two 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.680
 preparations we then incorporate our 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 whites in snow to the preparation based 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.520
 chocolate and always the same 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.179
 delicately we will come mixed of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.179
 circular way 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.269
 then we always add very 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.890
 delicately the sugar is mixed 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.250
 last time and you almost have 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.959
 finished your charlotte we're finally going 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.519
 to be able to go to the editing of our 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.700
 charlotte so we put in a plate 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.379
 digs 5 centilitres of white rum on 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 adds about the same amount of water 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.540
 we will come dipped our cookies in 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.160
 on both sides you could have by 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360
 example add a small sierro if you 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.269
 make a fruit charlotte 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.459
 a syrup like a grenadine with cuts 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.380
 then the biscuit so that it arrives 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.870
 stack at the height of our mold to 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.299
 charlotte and we will come and do everything 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.160
 inside the mold book the falls 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.599
 of biscuits with spoon and the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.400
 last that stays for simply 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.640
 do the basement just now and we will 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.650
 to be able to cut our pear 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.660
 so here you go make small 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.260
 slices of pears can come place 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.060
 in the center next to the boudoirs pours 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.640
 then the preparation based on 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.640
 chocolate in the center of the charlotte 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.489
 ended by placing the biscuits head in 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.139
 down to make the base is the moment 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.370
 where you can use the falls that 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.049
 you did not use just now 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.970
 to complete the small holes and 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.709
 Then we will be able to close and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.250
 let stand for at least four 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.250
 hours in the fridge 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.040
 we are back a few hours after 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.780
 do our charlotte you see the time 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.400
 to pose really important it allows to 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.040
 gelatin to do its job 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.569
 you will finally be able to taste it good
