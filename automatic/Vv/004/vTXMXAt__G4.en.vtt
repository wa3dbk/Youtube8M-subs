00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
mm-hmm but the moment I got I just took

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.050 
mm-hmm but the moment I got I just took
it<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.420> obvious<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> runs<00:01:08.060> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it out and it was obvious how it runs it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.260 
it out and it was obvious how it runs it
has<00:01:09.270> Emery<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.920> also<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.400> scotch<00:01:12.000> brite

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
has Emery it also has scotch brite

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.170 
has Emery it also has scotch brite
attachments<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:16.950> need<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.220> tools<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
attachments you don't need any tools to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.399 
attachments you don't need any tools to
put<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> grits<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> real<00:01:20.159> nice

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
put the grits in it which is real nice

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.070 
put the grits in it which is real nice
as<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.560> auxiliary<00:01:22.860> handle<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.960> pretty

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
as an auxiliary handle so it's pretty

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.990 
as an auxiliary handle so it's pretty
comfortable<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> heavy<00:01:26.729> tool

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
comfortable to use it's a heavy tool

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.410 
comfortable to use it's a heavy tool
yeah<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> needs<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:29.060> has<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> simple

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
yeah but it needs to be has a simple

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
yeah but it needs to be has a simple
switch<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> delay<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
switch on it with with a delay it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
switch on it with with a delay it
doesn't<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.759> fire<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
doesn't just fire right up so when you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
doesn't just fire right up so when you
turn<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> hesitates<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> second<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
turn it on it hesitates for a second and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
turn it on it hesitates for a second and
then<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> motor<00:01:37.079> engages<00:01:37.290> ok<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.220> that's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
then the motor engages ok so that's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
then the motor engages ok so that's
billed<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> bit<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> safety<00:01:39.360> switch<00:01:39.720> yeah

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
billed as a bit of a safety switch yeah

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
billed as a bit of a safety switch yeah
yeah<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.979> also<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.640> had<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> trigger<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
yeah it's also if it had a trigger you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
yeah it's also if it had a trigger you
couldn't<00:01:42.570> you'd<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.380> stuck<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.130> hand

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
couldn't you'd be stuck with your hand

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.240 
couldn't you'd be stuck with your hand
in<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.610> spot<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> time<00:01:45.360> ok<00:01:46.079> yeah<00:01:47.009> there's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
in one spot all the time ok yeah there's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.740 
in one spot all the time ok yeah there's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
some thought into who's going to use it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.740 
some thought into who's going to use it
right<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.570> used<00:01:51.570> it

right and what you use it for I used it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.899 
right and what you use it for I used it
on<00:01:51.869> initially<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.040> some<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.490> cold<00:01:53.700> rolled

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
on initially just some some cold rolled

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
on initially just some some cold rolled
steel<00:01:54.530> pipe<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> rack<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> was

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
steel pipe that was in the rack that was

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
steel pipe that was in the rack that was
rusty<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.450> clamped<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.649> some

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
rusty and we clamped it up and put some

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.840 
rusty and we clamped it up and put some
120<00:01:59.579> grit<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.829> made<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> couple<00:02:02.100> passes<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
120 grit and made a couple passes on it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.450 
120 grit and made a couple passes on it
and<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:04.500> brand<00:02:04.740> new<00:02:04.799> stainless<00:02:05.310> when

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and it was like brand new stainless when

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.859 
and it was like brand new stainless when
it<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.670> done<00:02:05.820> yeah<00:02:06.329> how<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.780> done

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it was done yeah how would you have done

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.650 
it was done yeah how would you have done
it<00:02:07.020> previously<00:02:07.580> would<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.789> get<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> roll<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it previously would just get a roll of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
it previously would just get a roll of
Emery<00:02:09.959> paper<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.039> wrap<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.250> around<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
Emery paper and just wrap it around it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.180 
Emery paper and just wrap it around it
and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190

yeah yeah learning curve with it I
didn't<00:02:25.270> have<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> learning<00:02:25.780> curve<00:02:25.870> with<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
didn't have a learning curve with it I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.040 
didn't have a learning curve with it I
you<00:02:26.830> know<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.640> start<00:02:28.600> grabbing<00:02:28.720> things

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
radius as I know and it was rusty had

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.210 
radius as I know and it was rusty had
been<00:02:36.610> stripped<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.060> paint<00:02:37.920> start<00:02:38.920> hitting

been stripped of paint start hitting
hitting<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.730> radiuses<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.630> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
hitting the radiuses of that and it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.300 
hitting the radiuses of that and it
brought<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.900> down<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.050> bare<00:02:41.350> bare<00:02:41.920> metal<00:02:42.250> and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
brought it down to bare bare metal and

it was really nice I did some fork legs

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.610 
it was really nice I did some fork legs
from<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.740> motorcycle<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.490> were<00:02:46.150> very<00:02:46.390> old

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
from a motorcycle that were very old

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
from a motorcycle that were very old
that<00:02:47.620> needed<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.010> same<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:49.090> know<00:02:49.120> polishing

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
put a nice finish yeah yeah six speeds

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.940 
put a nice finish yeah yeah six speeds
did<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.880> come<00:03:01.000> into<00:03:01.120> play<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.680> did

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
did that come into play for you it did

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.470 
did that come into play for you it did
but<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.160> didn't<00:03:03.460> you<00:03:03.580> know<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.730> think<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.270> slower

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
but I didn't you know I think the slower

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.310 
but I didn't you know I think the slower
speeds<00:03:05.490> maybe<00:03:06.490> for<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.730> heavier<00:03:07.290> grime<00:03:08.290> you

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
speeds maybe for the heavier grime you

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.690 
speeds maybe for the heavier grime you
know<00:03:08.620> if<00:03:08.740> you're<00:03:08.860> maybe<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.340> you're<00:03:09.460> if<00:03:09.610> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
know if you're maybe if you're if you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.420 
know if you're maybe if you're if you
join<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> tube<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:11.050> welded<00:03:11.310> you're<00:03:12.310> going

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
join a tube and it's welded you're going

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.950 
join a tube and it's welded you're going
to<00:03:12.490> put<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> heavier<00:03:12.910> grit<00:03:13.120> paper<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.570> turn<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
to put a heavier grit paper and turn the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.170 
to put a heavier grit paper and turn the
speed<00:03:14.170> down<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.650> actually<00:03:15.250> grind<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:16.000> well

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
speed down and actually grind that well

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.570 
speed down and actually grind that well
done<00:03:16.480> yeah<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:17.530> go<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:18.010> higher<00:03:18.220> grit

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
done yeah and then go to a higher grit

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.000 
done yeah and then go to a higher grit
paper<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.810> turn<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.140> speed<00:03:20.380> up<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.739> get<00:03:20.890> more

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
paper and turn the speed up and get more

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.640 
paper and turn the speed up and get more
