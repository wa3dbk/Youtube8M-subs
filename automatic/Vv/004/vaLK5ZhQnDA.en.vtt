00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.859
 these guys today we'll talk on the topic 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 increase computer performance 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.929
 improve computer performance 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.049
 there are several ways there 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.230
 many programs that deals 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.090
 solution to this problem in order to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.470
 download the program from the trainers to you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.470
 must be seen in any search engine 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 download the program I prefer 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.800
 download 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.250
 from the site a software portal. con 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.980
 because i like best 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 go click on the link 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.620
 go to the download tab and select 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 source 1 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.410
 we choose to download but I think further 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.350
 you have any problems with 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 installation should not give these links you 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 You can see in the description sik liners 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.420
 is just a simple program in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.030
 use not requiring any 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.170
 special knowledge 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 choices necessary items in this menu 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 we can clean the system 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 immediately or first or before 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.600
 to analyze and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 that is, see see cake what 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 offers us how it programs to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.430
 remove and so on at the moment i have 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 accumulated unnecessary information unnecessary 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030
 files on three hundred twenty eight 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.780
 gigabyte 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.990
 to judge and of course I try to do myself 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 clean up daily imagine 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 if you will be if you are not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 let's do well for a week 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.900
 imagine how much unnecessary information 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.440
 you will accumulate your computer 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.500
 and of course these files are not 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.350
 affects the increase 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 computer performance and choosing 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.740
 pre-selecting all items 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.760
 required item to remove 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.450
 click the clear button agree and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 further cleaning takes place 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.440
 see for yourself the removal process 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.450
 happens passes fast enough 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.790
 literally in one minute it is already possible 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.959
 say quite ask and since we 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.110
 we see our process is already coming to an end 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.510
 of soon we are already here on 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.450
 here we look at this at the moment 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.720
 cleared 328 megabytes and this is mine 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.560
 there are so many unnecessary files for 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.180
 one day here and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.110
 necessary with this also this program 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 has a number of useful properties 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.209
 here is one of them is problem solving in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.500
 the registry select all items but I tell you 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:20.170
 I recommend choosing seconds and then clicking 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:25.420
 he checks the button 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.420
 we are all registry violations 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.910
 can we all brought 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 we press a button from the project before it 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.600
 he offers us to keep the backup 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.850
 copy but it is up to you 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.760
 You can do it and I can not have 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.380
 I will not do it 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.320
 click the correct button marked and 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.080
 that's how we see everything will be fixed 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.070
 let's move on to the next way 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.750
 or increase productivity 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.090
 computer go to the control panel 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.050
 large icons alone 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:04.820
 system configuration administration and 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.740
 here we can watch but go in 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.660
 autoload tab and here we can 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.030
 watch a lot of programs 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.590
 installed on your computer 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.720
 which runs along with the launch 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.090
 windows that is, as soon as you turn on 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.799
 computer log in all these 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.350
 programs automatically run on 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.780
 you are already on the computer of course this is not 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.780
 there is good if you do not use them 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.700
 There are many programs that 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.040
 which you simply do not use 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.600
 which you just don't need you can 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.850
 here remove them from autoload that 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.610
 of course it will increase and significantly 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.110
 running your system and generally will increase 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.449
 performance 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.520
 but I think that's all thanks for your attention 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.150
 subscribe to my channel total 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.150
 good luck
