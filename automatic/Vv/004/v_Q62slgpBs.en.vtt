 by way of breaking up and download toomanyitems 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.120

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.160
 beasts that are required at home by man 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.150
 In this removal of buffs, the effects of all sorts 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.920
 this one can also save your set 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.290
 let's say we scored to hell with us 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 started it 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.050
 aptos all of them accidentally thrown out 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.209
 lost very much happened to them 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.800
 let's say we remove them now 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.040
 click here they come back so 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.470
 you can make 7 sets and enjoy life 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.930

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.890

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.060
 what weapon do you want even fish not 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.060

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 127 maximum, why should they 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.830
 unacceptable so get this fish up 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.320
 I understand the fish can not be considered 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.570
 pickaxe on here shows what it can 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.100
 enchant for luck just silk 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.870
 touch red these are the ones who don't 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.360
 fit and undesirable for this 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.760
 the subject is valid for the sword here at all 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.280

 create potions I never understood how I 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.930
 probably set a unique design 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 cyanide understood everything 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.440

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.620
