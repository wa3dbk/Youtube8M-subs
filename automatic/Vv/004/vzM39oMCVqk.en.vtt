00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
message and it really discouraged me he

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.779

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
think this gameplay ended like three

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.320 
think this gameplay ended like three
minutes<00:01:41.800> early<00:01:41.979> after<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:42.490> saw<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.759> message<00:01:42.940> I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
minutes early after I saw that message I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.850 
minutes early after I saw that message I

remember in mah room for three of the
game<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.170> would<00:02:20.560> go<00:02:20.800> sometimes<00:02:21.430> even<00:02:21.550> 11<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.000> 12

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
game it would go sometimes even 11 to 12

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.089

minutes<00:02:22.480> sometimes<00:02:22.900> 13<00:02:23.380> if<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.620> knew<00:02:23.890> how<00:02:24.040> to

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
minutes sometimes 13 if you knew how to

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.070 
minutes sometimes 13 if you knew how to
extend<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.670> game<00:02:24.819> long<00:02:25.000> enough<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.480> i<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
extend the game long enough and i just

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.690 
extend the game long enough and i just
don't<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.290> how<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.590> game<00:02:27.099> can<00:02:27.340> only<00:02:27.459> last

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
don't like how the game can only last

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.979 
don't like how the game can only last
like<00:02:27.849> 10<00:02:28.209> minutes<00:02:28.390> i'm<00:02:28.569> sure<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:28.959> be

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
like 10 minutes i'm sure there would be

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.350 
like 10 minutes i'm sure there would be
a<00:02:29.110> lot<00:02:29.319> more<00:02:29.349> 200-plus<00:02:29.980> kill<00:02:30.280> games<00:02:30.520> if<00:02:30.819> it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
a lot more 200-plus kill games if it

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.449 
a lot more 200-plus kill games if it
would<00:02:31.569> last<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.200> 11<00:02:32.560> 12<00:02:32.830> 13<00:02:32.890> minute

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459

apocalypse and this is probably the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.620 
apocalypse and this is probably the
third<00:02:39.489> or<00:02:39.610> fourth<00:02:39.819> one<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.300> I've<00:02:40.360> lived

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
drop of snow up until this point and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.420 
drop of snow up until this point and
