00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
lucid dreaming so I figured it would be

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.230 
lucid dreaming so I figured it would be
best<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:49.980> started<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.490> dream<00:03:50.670> journal<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
best if I started in a dream journal and
