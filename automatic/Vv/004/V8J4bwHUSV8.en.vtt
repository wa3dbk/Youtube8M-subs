00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.260 
you can do this right here kind of makes
it<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.939> realistic<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
it look more realistic it like kind of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.720 
it look more realistic it like kind of
shades<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.459> usually

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
shades it if you will I don't usually

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.540 
shades it if you will I don't usually
use<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.540> for

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
use that but it's just for

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.330 
use that but it's just for
an<00:02:14.550> example<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:15.990> go<00:02:16.290> ahead<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.770> mess

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
an example so you can go ahead and mess

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.970 
an example so you can go ahead and mess
with<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:19.020> colors<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> eyes<00:02:19.740> if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> want

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
with the colors of the eyes if you want

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.300 
with the colors of the eyes if you want
you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.190> draw<00:02:23.520> your<00:02:23.850> own<00:02:23.880> parts<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.630> want

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you can draw your own parts if you want

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can draw your own parts if you want
so<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.970> example<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.600> could<00:02:28.250> if<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.430> want<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.910> could

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
so for example I could if I want I could

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.700 
so for example I could if I want I could
extend<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.410> guy's<00:02:31.590> arm<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.500> as

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
extended all the way around so there's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.570
