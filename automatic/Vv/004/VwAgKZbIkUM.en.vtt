00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.410
 what is it that I have 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.240
 around the neck here is a scarf 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.350
 done in Vienna with just an old tee 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.350
 shirt you need a needle 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.760
 scissors and that's all there and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.129
 you're done it's very easy to do 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.300
 I let you watch all this and 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.530
 do not hesitate to put a small 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.850
 comment is to subscribe to ms 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.860
 hachem if you're interested 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 here I wish you a good viewing 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.260
 so to do this tutorial you will have 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.660
 need a pair of old scissors 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.680
 t-shirt so a simple t-shirt in 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.480
 cotton hop here is a normal t-shirt he 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.790
 you will also need some sewing thread from 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.979
 the color of your t-shirt and a 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:13.100
 needle and you go place and tee 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.649
 shirt horizontally admits on on the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.590
 table and now we're going to cut out 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:23.450
 here the end seam what does it serve 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.779
 for nothing it will not be useful so we 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.779
 cutting 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 m 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.740
 so once that's done we're going 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.880
 come on so I remember that the sleeves 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.640
 are here and here 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 that's it and so we're going to come 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.760
 bands like this here it's simple 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.170
 so of course the tapes she has to she 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.940
 be firm and on each side 1 take 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.020
 well tee shirt in the good sense so we 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.480
 cutting benches of width that 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.590
 you want me I take sales from to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.590
 about 2 cm 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.540
 it is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 Paris 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.719
 so you continue like this until 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.250
 do not worry if it's not 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.989
 super right it's really not serious 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.129
 you will see after that anyway 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.760
 it will not be seen here you do that 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.889
 really to the end 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.930
 so here I have two leftovers because 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.349
 that we will be embarrassed by the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.349
 the sleeves so but hey you have 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:17.200
 still keep it that piece out here 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:20.439
 because we will use it after that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.310
 so here I cut out my last little 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.469
 tape up and so I have that left of the tee 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.019
 shirt 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.719
 here it is the sleeves and the collar 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:37.150
 what's that I put aside 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:42.669
 here you are here with so 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.440
 all all your t-shirts and 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.000
 now you are going to come get 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:55.389
 each end and you simply 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.109
 the dashes here are pulling on it and we 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.970
 gets to that it smells rolls in fact so 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.709
 it's really great even if it's not 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:09.609
 cut right is not serious since 500 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:11.739
 I'm doing a second man 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.870
 I take each end at every stitch 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.870
 in fact and hop I pull 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.210
 so that's because you had before and 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:29.830
 there I made two mastiffs with when 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:32.190
 you end up so you go 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.110
 do that with all the strips of fabric 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.860
 and Bella I will finish and then I will 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.870
 find right after that so here I 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.730
 am completely disgusted because 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.440
 did there was more room on my 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.870
 map and I erased the whole part that 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.360
 was coming before this one what so I'm going 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.170
 explain to you I hope that it will go 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.390
 for you but hey it's very simple and 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.220
 finally go again I'm sorry 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.020
 I'm downright disgusted 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.840
 really not erased the good part 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:10.120
 well, it does not matter once you 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:12.700
 have finished so you're going to get this 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.340
 result there so pulling on that 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.740
 without rolling its shape of the small tubes 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.500
 you will take the seams yourself 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.140
 go the assemblies not both sides 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.750
 of course a sewing lot of each 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:30.400
 side then you will take the 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.740
 rest of the t-shirt we put aside 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.080
 just now you cut them two 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.960
 rectangles of big rectangle of in the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.300
 bigger possible and then you 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.090
 would come at the seams 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.300
 wrap them around to hide them so 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.130
 there what I did was that I 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.400
 stitch with a needle in the sharp 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.860
 and in the end of rectangle I stitched 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.390
 several times and then I did a 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.760
 knot at the end after I rolled up the 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.860
 kind roulettes or the rectangle and then 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.510
 so around the seams that lies 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.920
 there in the middle so I went from 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.080
 each side a little further 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.360
 and then if I made a last small 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.780
 point and I cut the end of fabric that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 exceeded so that's the end that you 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.400
 give this here is then either you 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.930
 can wear it like that or then you 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.140
 can very well place to put a 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.580
 fabric end of the same t-shirt by 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.000
 example 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.919
 more a game is not a piece of a 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.080
 brown or that's another color and 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:37.139
 then hung a little pin on it 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.569
 for a slightly more accessorized effect 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:42.599
 or so here you can wear it 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.979
 like that you can tour a big 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:47.280
 number of times - the tee shirt I have 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.449
 it was xl like that because I 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.020
 wanted her to be the biggest 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.409
 possible 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.270
 it was even double xl so I think 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:07:01.949
 here and then you can very well 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:04.590
 do a last trick up and that you 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.389
 give it that I think it's a 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.330
 nice scarf for this summer for 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.469
 for the cool evening you 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.710
 can put that instead of putting a 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:15.569
 wool scarf what are you listening to 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.360
 and I hope this little tutorial will have you 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.849
 been helpful after you can very well 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.620
 put on the head 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.529
 here you can very well do that or 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.180
 squarely wrap it around the head 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:29.849
 to make you a kind of bandanna 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.379
 there are plenty of possibilities or 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.080
 taking for example a children's t-shirt 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.060
 you can make a bracelet there are 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.699
 really full full of things to 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.199
 to do with that well here's listening and 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.199
 I hope this little tutorial would have you 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.389
 been helpful and I'm still sorry for 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.279
 the missing part good it's the most 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.229
 simple I hope anyway it's a 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:51.629
 very simple tutorial I hope it 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.039
 you will still be enough and I will 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:56.599
