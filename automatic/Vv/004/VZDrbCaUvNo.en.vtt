I<00:00:00.110> like<00:00:01.110> filming<00:00:01.500> my<00:00:01.650> videos<00:00:02.040> with<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.240> iphone

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I like filming my videos with my iphone

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.340 
I like filming my videos with my iphone
in<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.890> case<00:00:05.130> my<00:00:05.339> iphone<00:00:05.730> 5<00:00:06.029> it's<00:00:06.899> got<00:00:07.080> an<00:00:07.200> 8

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
in this case my iphone 5 it's got an 8

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.009 
in this case my iphone 5 it's got an 8
megapixel<00:00:07.620> camera<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.360> results<00:00:09.870> I've

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
megapixel camera and the results I've

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.320 
megapixel camera and the results I've
seen<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.620> been<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:11.309> really<00:00:11.429> good<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
seen have been really really good so I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.289 
seen have been really really good so I
thought<00:00:12.630> why<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.320> make<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.730> camera<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
thought why not make this my camera and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.380 
thought why not make this my camera and
it's<00:00:15.480> worked<00:00:15.690> great<00:00:15.990> except<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:16.859> I

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
it's worked great except for one thing I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.660 
it's worked great except for one thing I
didn't<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> great<00:00:18.960> way<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> mount<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
didn't have a great way to mount it to a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.540 
didn't have a great way to mount it to a
tripod<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> went<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.960> Thingiverse<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
tripod so I went on Thingiverse and I

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.089 
tripod so I went on Thingiverse and I
found<00:00:23.850> several<00:00:24.359> different<00:00:25.019> iphone<00:00:25.590> stands

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
found several different iphone stands

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.390 
found several different iphone stands
that<00:00:26.820> work<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> tripod<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.890> found<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that work with a tripod and I found a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
that work with a tripod and I found a
real<00:00:29.699> simple<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:31.080> two<00:00:31.320> walls

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
real simple one that had two walls

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.520 
real simple one that had two walls
sticking<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.600> put<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> iphone

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
sticking up and you put the iphone

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
sticking up and you put the iphone
between<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.640> problem<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
between it the problem was one of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
between it the problem was one of the
walls<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.520> block<00:00:38.820> my<00:00:39.149> view<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
walls would actually block my view in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.940 
walls would actually block my view in
the<00:00:40.379> front<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> camera<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:43.140> made<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> new

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the front of the camera so i made a new

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.450 
the front of the camera so i made a new
one<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> lower<00:00:45.510> wall<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.219> that's<00:00:47.219> what

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
one with a lower wall and that's what

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.500 
one with a lower wall and that's what
I'm<00:00:47.550> using<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:49.110> hold<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> iphone<00:00:50.390> let<00:00:51.390> me

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
I'm using here to hold the iphone let me

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
I'm using here to hold the iphone let me
show<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.129> how<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> built<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.170> use<00:00:55.170> Tinkercad

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
show you how I built it I use Tinkercad

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.639 
show you how I built it I use Tinkercad
to<00:00:56.010> create<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> design<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.059> load<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to create the design I load it in the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.279 
to create the design I load it in the
original<00:00:58.890> stl<00:00:59.670> file<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.390> user<00:01:00.660> named<00:01:00.989> Sam

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
original stl file from user named Sam

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.030 
original stl file from user named Sam
Kass<00:01:02.390> next<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> needed<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> gap<00:01:04.530> wider

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Kass next I needed to make the gap wider

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
Kass next I needed to make the gap wider
I<00:01:05.400> needed<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.420> ten<00:01:06.780> point<00:01:07.080> eight

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I needed it to be ten point eight

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280 
I needed it to be ten point eight
millimeters<00:01:07.860> wide<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> placed<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.750> block<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
millimeters wide so I placed a block in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
millimeters wide so I placed a block in
between<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.040> sides<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.360> exactly

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
between the two sides that was exactly

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.770 
between the two sides that was exactly
ten<00:01:13.140> point<00:01:13.380> eight<00:01:13.560> millimeters<00:01:14.159> wide<00:01:14.450> then<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
ten point eight millimeters wide then I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
ten point eight millimeters wide then I
changed<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.979> hole<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.299> actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
changed that to a hole so would actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560 
changed that to a hole so would actually
take<00:01:18.810> away<00:01:19.110> material<00:01:19.909> next<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.090> needed<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> make

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
take away material next I needed to make

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
take away material next I needed to make
one<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> walls<00:01:22.229> lower<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.860> needed<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
one of the walls lower I needed it to be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
one of the walls lower I needed it to be
15<00:01:24.479> millimeters<00:01:25.020> tall<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> bottom<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
15 millimeters tall from the bottom so I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.539 
15 millimeters tall from the bottom so I
placed<00:01:27.210> another<00:01:27.509> block<00:01:28.070> exactly<00:01:29.070> 15

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
placed another block exactly 15

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
placed another block exactly 15
millimeters<00:01:30.090> off<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.479> bottom<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.930> covered

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
millimeters off the bottom and covered

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
millimeters off the bottom and covered
the<00:01:32.009> whole<00:01:32.189> wall<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:33.210> made<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the whole wall then made that into a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.470 
the whole wall then made that into a
hole<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.159> material<00:01:35.610> away

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
hole to take material away

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.540 
hole to take material away
then<00:01:37.870> I<00:01:37.960> grouped<00:01:38.230> everything<00:01:38.710> together<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
then I grouped everything together to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.450 
then I grouped everything together to
make<00:01:39.760> one<00:01:39.970> solid<00:01:40.510> unit<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.860> had<00:01:42.220> my

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
make one solid unit and then I had my

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.460 
make one solid unit and then I had my
final<00:01:43.150> design<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.880> exported<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> stl

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
final design then I exported the stl

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.250 
final design then I exported the stl
file<00:01:47.740> from<00:01:47.980> Tinkercad<00:01:48.370> and<00:01:49.080> imported<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.170> into

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
file from Tinkercad and imported it into

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.340 
file from Tinkercad and imported it into
the<00:01:50.620> XYZ<00:01:51.040> software<00:01:51.760> for<00:01:52.330> my<00:01:52.450> DaVinci<00:01:52.990> 3d

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the XYZ software for my DaVinci 3d

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.770 
the XYZ software for my DaVinci 3d
printer<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.990> used<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.140> 0.4<00:01:57.130> layer<00:01:57.970> height<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.450> a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
printer I used a 0.4 layer height and a

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.410 
printer I used a 0.4 layer height and a
ten<00:01:59.020> percent<00:01:59.170> fill<00:01:59.680> this<00:02:00.610> gave<00:02:00.880> me<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> design

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
ten percent fill this gave me a design

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
ten percent fill this gave me a design
that<00:02:01.450> was<00:02:01.690> plenty<00:02:02.020> strong<00:02:02.230> enough<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.740> quick

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
that was plenty strong enough and quick

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:21.080 
that was plenty strong enough and quick
to<00:02:03.700> build<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.690> printed<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.230> about<00:02:05.620> 30<00:02:06.010> minutes

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.140 

you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.170 

when<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> design<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.409> done<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.950> let<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.970> cool

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
when the design was done I let it cool
