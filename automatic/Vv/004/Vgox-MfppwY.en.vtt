I<00:06:36.520> haven't<00:06:36.970> tried<00:06:37.090> it<00:06:37.180> yet<00:06:37.300> because<00:06:37.450> I<00:06:37.630> just

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
I haven't tried it yet because I just

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.870

ran<00:06:38.050> out<00:06:38.260> but<00:06:38.770> I<00:06:38.830> think<00:06:39.070> I<00:06:39.190> might<00:06:39.400> because<00:06:39.580> it

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
ran out but I think I might because it

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.610 
ran out but I think I might because it
doesn't<00:06:40.120> crease<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.570> i<00:06:41.050> like<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.350> use<00:06:41.410> it<00:06:41.590> for

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
doesn't crease and i like to use it for

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.080 
doesn't crease and i like to use it for

my under eye circles and like all of
