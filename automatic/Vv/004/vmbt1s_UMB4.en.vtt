all<00:00:01.790> right<00:00:02.030> so<00:00:02.390> today<00:00:02.510> I'm<00:00:02.570> gonna<00:00:02.720> explain<00:00:02.930> a

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990 
all right so today I'm gonna explain a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.749 
all right so today I'm gonna explain a
little<00:00:03.080> bit<00:00:03.290> about<00:00:03.440> the<00:00:03.680> the<00:00:04.040> cooling<00:00:04.370> system

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
little bit about the the cooling system

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.239 
little bit about the the cooling system
like<00:00:05.029> the<00:00:05.149> radiator<00:00:05.509> and<00:00:05.720> a<00:00:05.779> thermostat<00:00:06.289> on<00:00:06.470> a

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:07.249 
like the radiator and a thermostat on a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.400 
like the radiator and a thermostat on a
Jeep<00:00:07.669> Grand<00:00:07.819> Cherokee<00:00:08.360> this<00:00:08.960> applies<00:00:09.230> towards

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
Jeep Grand Cherokee this applies towards

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.730 
Jeep Grand Cherokee this applies towards
a<00:00:09.740> lot<00:00:10.040> of<00:00:10.099> different<00:00:10.339> vehicles<00:00:10.669> though<00:00:11.740> so

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
a lot of different vehicles though so

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.959 
a lot of different vehicles though so
first<00:00:12.950> of<00:00:13.040> all<00:00:13.099> we<00:00:13.190> have<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.370> radiator<00:00:13.759> cap

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
first of all we have the radiator cap

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.299 
first of all we have the radiator cap
here<00:00:14.240> what<00:00:14.959> the<00:00:15.019> radiator<00:00:15.289> cap<00:00:15.469> does<00:00:15.740> is<00:00:15.950> first

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
here what the radiator cap does is first

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.100 
here what the radiator cap does is first
of<00:00:16.460> all<00:00:16.550> it<00:00:16.670> allows<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:17.210> know<00:00:17.270> it's<00:00:17.420> a<00:00:17.480> lid<00:00:17.690> for

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
of all it allows you know it's a lid for

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.290 
of all it allows you know it's a lid for
your<00:00:18.140> radiator<00:00:18.620> but<00:00:19.250> it<00:00:19.340> also<00:00:19.460> is<00:00:19.730> made<00:00:20.180> up

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
your radiator but it also is made up

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.870 
your radiator but it also is made up
with<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> few<00:00:20.660> different<00:00:20.930> parts<00:00:21.550> we<00:00:22.550> got<00:00:22.580> the

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
with a few different parts we got the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.810 
with a few different parts we got the
the<00:00:23.240> spring<00:00:23.570> inside<00:00:23.930> of<00:00:24.080> there<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.820> it's

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
the spring inside of there is it's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.150 
the spring inside of there is it's
temperature<00:00:26.780> sensitive<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.620> when<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:27.950> when

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
temperature sensitive like when it when

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.010 
temperature sensitive like when it when
it<00:00:28.250> gets<00:00:28.370> really<00:00:28.760> hot<00:00:28.970> that<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.690> spring

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
it gets really hot that the spring

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.390 
it gets really hot that the spring
contracts<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:30.860> allows<00:00:31.700> this<00:00:32.980> part<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
contracts and allows this part of it the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.250 
contracts and allows this part of it the
lid<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.090> shrink<00:00:35.480> down<00:00:35.690> inside<00:00:36.050> of<00:00:36.170> it

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
lid of it to shrink down inside of it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.980 
lid of it to shrink down inside of it
just<00:00:36.410> like<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:36.560> allowing<00:00:37.510> more<00:00:38.510> space<00:00:38.810> to

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
just like that allowing more space to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.569 
just like that allowing more space to
pass<00:00:39.170> through<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.620> reason<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:39.950> does<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.130> is

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
pass through the reason it does that is

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.230 
pass through the reason it does that is
because<00:00:41.540> you<00:00:41.630> can<00:00:41.810> see<00:00:42.020> here<00:00:42.290> on<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.530> radiator

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
because you can see here on the radiator

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.880 
because you can see here on the radiator
there's<00:00:44.240> a<00:00:44.300> little<00:00:44.540> hose<00:00:44.750> right<00:00:45.020> here<00:00:45.290> so<00:00:45.739> when

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
there's a little hose right here so when

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.729 
there's a little hose right here so when
the<00:00:45.980> cap<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.489> fully<00:00:46.820> on<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.120> cool<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.530> is

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
the cap is fully on and cool this is

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.340 
the cap is fully on and cool this is
expanded<00:00:49.220> all<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> way<00:00:49.870> but<00:00:50.870> as<00:00:50.960> soon<00:00:51.140> as<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
expanded all the way but as soon as the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.410 
expanded all the way but as soon as the
radiator<00:00:51.710> starts<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.160> eat<00:00:52.340> up<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:52.790> contracts

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
radiator starts to eat up this contracts

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.840 
radiator starts to eat up this contracts
allowing<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.739> fluid<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.310> escape<00:00:55.610> through

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
allowing the fluid to escape through

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.720 
allowing the fluid to escape through
this<00:00:55.970> line<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.530> go<00:00:57.530> into<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.920> reservoir<00:00:58.460> a

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
this line and go into the reservoir a

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.930 
this line and go into the reservoir a
coolant<00:00:59.300> reservoir<00:00:59.420> over<00:00:59.840> there<00:01:00.820> then<00:01:01.820> we

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
coolant reservoir over there then we

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.119 
coolant reservoir over there then we
have<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.630> thermostat<00:01:03.320> which<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.710> kind<00:01:03.950> of<00:01:04.009> the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
have the thermostat which is kind of the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.770 
have the thermostat which is kind of the
same<00:01:04.549> concept<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.509> this<00:01:06.280> contracts<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:08.450> allow

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
same concept but this contracts to allow

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.050 
same concept but this contracts to allow
the<00:01:08.840> coolant<00:01:09.469> to<00:01:09.649> enter<00:01:09.979> into<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.579> engine

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
the coolant to enter into the engine

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.599 
the coolant to enter into the engine
itself<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:12.409> if<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.679> ever<00:01:12.799> get<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.130> point

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
itself so if you ever get to a point

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.569 
itself so if you ever get to a point
where<00:01:13.880> your<00:01:14.060> engine<00:01:14.770> or<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:15.920> radiator<00:01:16.399> is

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
where your engine or your radiator is

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.910 
where your engine or your radiator is
just<00:01:16.759> boiling<00:01:17.179> over<00:01:17.329> with<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:17.990> with<00:01:18.829> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
just boiling over with the with the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.349 
just boiling over with the with the
radiator<00:01:19.280> fluid<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:19.789> one<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.030> these<00:01:20.149> two

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
radiator fluid it's one of these two

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.379 
radiator fluid it's one of these two
parts<00:01:20.719> either<00:01:21.709> the<00:01:21.950> radiator<00:01:22.520> cap<00:01:22.789> or<00:01:23.329> the

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
parts either the radiator cap or the

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.379 
parts either the radiator cap or the
thermostat<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.310> on<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.520> thermostat<00:01:25.759> usually

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
thermostat so on the thermostat usually

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.760 
thermostat so on the thermostat usually
goes<00:01:26.569> you<00:01:26.899> know<00:01:26.959> towards<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.350> top<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.709> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
goes you know towards the top of the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.660 
goes you know towards the top of the
engine<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:29.389> case<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:29.929> goes<00:01:30.079> right<00:01:30.289> here

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
engine in this case it goes right here

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.459 
engine in this case it goes right here
inside<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:31.939> little<00:01:31.999> contraption<00:01:32.899> so<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
inside of this little contraption so the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:34.959 
inside of this little contraption so the
radiator<00:01:33.859> fluid<00:01:33.979> comes<00:01:34.340> out<00:01:34.549> through<00:01:34.759> here

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
radiator fluid comes out through here

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.209 
radiator fluid comes out through here
and<00:01:35.209> goes<00:01:35.359> down<00:01:35.689> but<00:01:36.499> only<00:01:37.029> when<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:39.469> engine

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
and goes down but only when the engine

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.949 
and goes down but only when the engine
is<00:01:40.310> hot<00:01:40.520> enough<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.569> get<00:01:41.659> these<00:01:41.779> at

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
is hot enough so you can get these at

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.989 
is hot enough so you can get these at
varying<00:01:42.289> degrees<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.770> one<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.099> 195<00:01:43.759> you

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
varying degrees this one is the 195 you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.019 
varying degrees this one is the 195 you
can<00:01:44.119> kind<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.299> see<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.539> right<00:01:44.659> there<00:01:45.099> I<00:01:46.099> replace

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
can kind of see it right there I replace

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.629 
can kind of see it right there I replace
mine<00:01:47.359> with<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.569> with<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> lower<00:01:48.590> 101-80

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
mine with a with a lower 101-80

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.219 
mine with a with a lower 101-80
just<00:01:49.999> so<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.119> can<00:01:50.299> get<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.539> coolant<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.079> there

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
just so I can get the coolant in there
