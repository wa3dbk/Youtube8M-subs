is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> massive<00:00:22.619> amplifier<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.189> terms<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> power

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
is a massive amplifier in terms of power

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.340 
is a massive amplifier in terms of power
but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.720> large<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
but it's really not all that large and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.630 
but it's really not all that large and
if<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
if you think about it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820 
if you think about it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.610 
installation some really cool things
about<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.420> amplifier<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
about this amplifier that I like is the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
about this amplifier that I like is the
fact<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.920> first<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> has<00:00:41.850> our

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
fact that first of all it has our

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
fact that first of all it has our
advanced<00:00:42.420> rollback<00:00:42.930> thermal<00:00:43.290> protection

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
advanced rollback thermal protection

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
advanced rollback thermal protection
which<00:00:44.340> basically<00:00:44.700> means<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
which basically means that even if the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
which basically means that even if the
amplifier<00:00:46.079> starts<00:00:46.379> getting<00:00:46.620> hot<00:00:46.649> it'll<00:00:47.039> never

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
amplifier starts getting hot it'll never

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
amplifier starts getting hot it'll never
shut<00:00:47.640> down<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> thermal<00:00:48.360> event<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.960> if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
shut down from a thermal event so if

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.479 
shut down from a thermal event so if
you're<00:00:49.200> playing<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.559> system<00:00:49.860> hard<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you're playing your system hard you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.380 
you're playing your system hard you
don't<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> worry<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> ever

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
don't have to worry about it ever

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
don't have to worry about it ever
shutting<00:00:51.780> down<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> thermal<00:00:52.440> issue<00:00:52.879> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
shutting down from a thermal issue the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.020 
shutting down from a thermal issue the
XT<00:00:54.270> 1000<00:00:54.870> /<00:00:55.050> 1v2<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:56.070> takes<00:00:56.340> advantage<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
XT 1000 / 1v2 also takes advantage of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
XT 1000 / 1v2 also takes advantage of
our<00:00:57.210> next<00:00:57.600> e<00:00:57.719> switching<00:00:58.230> amplifier

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
our next e switching amplifier

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
our next e switching amplifier
technology<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.730> what<00:01:00.180> next<00:01:00.329> D<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.899> all

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
technology and what next D is really all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
technology and what next D is really all
about<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.620> making<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> amplifier<00:01:02.430> more

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
about is making the amplifier more

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.910 
about is making the amplifier more
efficient<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.780> means<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.320> draws<00:01:04.680> less

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
efficient and that means it draws less

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
efficient and that means it draws less
from<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.250> electrical<00:01:05.760> system<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
from your electrical system and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
from your electrical system and
generates<00:01:06.780> less<00:01:06.990> heat<00:01:07.049> that's<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.040> get

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
generates less heat that's how we get

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.920 
generates less heat that's how we get
the<00:01:08.310> chassis<00:01:08.729> size<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.119> small<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.810> need

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the chassis size so small we don't need

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
the chassis size so small we don't need
as<00:01:10.080> much<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.439> heatsink<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> dissipate<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
as much of heatsink to dissipate that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
as much of heatsink to dissipate that
excess<00:01:12.390> wasted<00:01:12.960> Heat<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.920> much

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
excess wasted Heat there is not much

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370

a separate knob the inputs and outputs
on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> amplifier<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.720> special<00:01:34.170> we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
on the amplifier are really special we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
on the amplifier are really special we
feature<00:01:34.799> balanced<00:01:35.310> differential<00:01:35.880> input

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210

stage<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> amplifier<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
stage on the amplifier so you can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
stage on the amplifier so you can
basically<00:01:37.890> hook<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> virtually<00:01:39.090> any

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
basically hook it up to virtually any
