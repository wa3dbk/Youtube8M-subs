first off this program is actually in
pre<00:03:41.730> beta<00:03:42.000> version<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.800> they<00:03:44.190> got<00:03:44.430> leaked

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
pre beta version and the they got leaked

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.040 
pre beta version and the they got leaked
and<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.280> very<00:03:47.310> buggy<00:03:47.849> like<00:03:48.269> sometimes<00:03:48.569> say

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
and it is very buggy like sometimes say

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.530 
and it is very buggy like sometimes say
you<00:03:49.110> start<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.680> your<00:03:49.709> music<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.760> maybe<00:03:51.209> some

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you start up your music and maybe some

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.509 
you start up your music and maybe some
games<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.470> go<00:03:52.620> back<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.860> try<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.190> do<00:03:53.370> it

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
games if you go back and try to do it

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.580 
games if you go back and try to do it
they<00:03:53.700> will<00:03:53.819> most<00:03:54.060> likely<00:03:54.269> not<00:03:54.450> do<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.560> that

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
they will most likely not do it and that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.090 
they will most likely not do it and that
means<00:03:56.400> you're<00:03:56.519> going<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.700> restring<00:03:57.209> it

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
means you're going to restring it

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.480 
means you're going to restring it
sometimes

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
sometimes

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.790 
sometimes
some<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.240> icons<00:04:01.360> we<00:04:01.810> flipped<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.590> then

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
some of the icons we flipped so then

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.110 
some of the icons we flipped so then
will<00:04:02.950> not<00:04:03.130> be<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:04.950> might<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.100> stuck<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> at

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
will not be and might be stuck in the at

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.490 
will not be and might be stuck in the at
the<00:04:07.240> point<00:04:07.450> where<00:04:07.660> you<00:04:07.780> cannot<00:04:08.050> flip<00:04:08.320> your

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
the point where you cannot flip your

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.860 
the point where you cannot flip your
icons<00:04:08.830> anymore<00:04:09.250> because<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.940> don't<00:04:10.810> know

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
icons anymore because I don't know

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.390 
icons anymore because I don't know
really<00:04:11.260> what<00:04:11.470> happens<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.540> yeah<00:04:14.040> that's<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
really what happens so yeah that's the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.220 
really what happens so yeah that's the
only<00:04:15.640> bad<00:04:16.000> thing<00:04:16.060> about<00:04:16.300> this<00:04:16.570> it's<00:04:16.840> don't<00:04:17.110> a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
only bad thing about this it's don't a

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.020 
only bad thing about this it's don't a
pre<00:04:17.530> beta<00:04:17.920> version<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.489> even<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.820> beta

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
pre beta version not even the beta

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.840 
pre beta version not even the beta
version<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.510> out<00:04:19.630> yet<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.370> do<00:04:21.370> not<00:04:21.489> know<00:04:21.730> when

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
version is out yet I do not know when

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.460 
version is out yet I do not know when
the<00:04:21.940> actual<00:04:22.210> version<00:04:22.390> will<00:04:22.630> be<00:04:22.660> out<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:23.170> keep

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
the actual version will be out just keep

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.130 
the actual version will be out just keep
up<00:04:23.620> with<00:04:23.830> xsellize<00:04:24.570> since<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.720> believe<00:04:25.990> they

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
up with xsellize since I believe they

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.310 
up with xsellize since I believe they
are<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.650> main<00:04:27.310> carriers<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.320> hope

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
are the main carriers of this and hope

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.770 
are the main carriers of this and hope
you<00:04:29.440> enjoy<00:04:29.590> this
