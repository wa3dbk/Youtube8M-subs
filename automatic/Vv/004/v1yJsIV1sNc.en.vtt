00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.769
 what can happen 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 it's true that we play mostly to 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.699
 our team we do not look much 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.230
 other teams we have it especially our 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.609
 team that would have only two 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 teams that is worse than we see it 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
 all the teams that play against the

 wac plays without pressure is the pressure 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460

 always win colossal incana accounts 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 know earth we have been placed our 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.970
 players must know how to play and live 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.549
 with this pressure a pressure of 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.310
 champion and two great teams no 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.619
 that no more heroes kingdoms 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 we're not going to do I think we're not going 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.020

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.270
 players for three positions then he can 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:29.850

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.870

 lausanne drags off the nerves ocstat 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 but it's a problem that all 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 coaches like to have to choose 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.380
 between good players between good 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.380
