00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.879 

so<00:00:05.910> what<00:00:06.090> inspired<00:00:06.240> me<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.809> go<00:00:07.080> plastic<00:00:07.590> free

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:07.889 
so what inspired me to go plastic free

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.310 
so what inspired me to go plastic free
was<00:00:08.429> our<00:00:08.849> albatross<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> Monterey<00:00:10.290> Bay

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
was our albatross at the Monterey Bay

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.020 
was our albatross at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.549> the<00:00:11.610> things<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.999> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Aquarium one of the things that I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.259 
Aquarium one of the things that I
realized<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:13.139> plastic<00:00:13.650> free<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.280> this

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
realized going plastic free is this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.359 
realized going plastic free is this
extends<00:00:15.749> to<00:00:15.929> much<00:00:16.200> more<00:00:16.500> than<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.710> plastic

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
extends to much more than just plastic

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.370 
extends to much more than just plastic
in<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:17.760> life<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.960> our<00:00:19.110> lives

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
in my life and really all of our lives

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
in my life and really all of our lives
it<00:00:19.800> speaks<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.610> conservation<00:00:21.450> ethic<00:00:21.630> that

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it speaks to the conservation ethic that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.440 
it speaks to the conservation ethic that
we<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.530> of<00:00:22.680> us<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.280> me<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.150> was

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
we have in all of us for me this was

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.930 
we have in all of us for me this was
really<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.870> moral<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.590> ethical<00:00:25.800> issue<00:00:26.340> about

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
really a moral and ethical issue about

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.000 
really a moral and ethical issue about
what<00:00:27.390> we're<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:27.840> our<00:00:28.020> planet<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> what

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
what we're doing to our planet and what

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
what we're doing to our planet and what
I'm<00:00:29.130> leaving<00:00:29.340> behind<00:00:29.600> for<00:00:30.600> my<00:00:31.020> future

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I'm leaving behind for my future

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.610 
I'm leaving behind for my future
children<00:00:32.189> grandchildren<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> only<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
children grandchildren it's only been in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.100 
children grandchildren it's only been in
the<00:00:34.710> last<00:00:34.890> 50<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.490> 70<00:00:35.970> years<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.630> plastics

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the last 50 to 70 years where plastics

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
the last 50 to 70 years where plastics
have<00:00:37.170> become<00:00:37.470> prevalent<00:00:37.740> but<00:00:38.550> we've

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have become prevalent but we've

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.819 
have become prevalent but we've
exchanged<00:00:39.300> convenience<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.530> time

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
exchanged convenience for time

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.340 
exchanged convenience for time
commitment<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> had<00:00:42.060> to<00:00:42.180> give<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.660> lot<00:00:43.110> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
commitment so I had to give up a lot of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
commitment so I had to give up a lot of
plastic<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.880> much<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
plastic because so much of what we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
plastic because so much of what we
consume<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.739> outside<00:00:47.250> packaging<00:00:47.730> might<00:00:47.880> be

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
consume the outside packaging might be

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.300 
consume the outside packaging might be
paper<00:00:48.239> cardboard<00:00:48.810> but<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> inside<00:00:49.739> packaging

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
paper cardboard but the inside packaging

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.610 
paper cardboard but the inside packaging
is<00:00:50.460> plastic<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.270> least<00:00:51.450> plastic<00:00:51.960> line<00:00:52.200> some

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
is plastic or at least plastic line some

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
is plastic or at least plastic line some
of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> stuff<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.130> found<00:00:53.360> probably<00:00:54.360> went<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of the stuff I found probably went to a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.160 
of the stuff I found probably went to a
landfill<00:00:56.070> probably<00:00:56.700> went<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.210> trash<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.989> at

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
landfill probably went to a trash can at

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
landfill probably went to a trash can at
some<00:00:58.350> point<00:00:58.489> probably<00:00:59.489> even<00:00:59.670> went<00:00:59.880> into<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
some point probably even went into a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
some point probably even went into a
recycling<00:01:00.720> container<00:01:01.110> but<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.700> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
recycling container but all of that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.450 
recycling container but all of that
stuff<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.360> escape<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.799> didn't<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.339> them

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
stuff can escape and I didn't want them

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.380 
stuff can escape and I didn't want them
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.030> our<00:01:06.810> ocean<00:01:07.440> because<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
going to our ocean because it really is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
going to our ocean because it really is
the<00:01:09.450> life-support<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.440> our<00:01:10.560> planet<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.190> also

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the life-support of our planet I also

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.420 
the life-support of our planet I also
had<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.940> think<00:01:12.120> about<00:01:12.330> things<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:13.340> where<00:01:14.340> do

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
had to think about things like where do

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
had to think about things like where do
my<00:01:14.520> clothes<00:01:14.820> come<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.690> my<00:01:15.780> clothes

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
my clothes come from what are my clothes

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.680 
my clothes come from what are my clothes
made<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.920> most<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:17.970> clothes<00:01:18.270> today

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
made out of most of our clothes today

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.130 
made out of most of our clothes today
are<00:01:18.990> made<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> plastic<00:01:20.330> polyester<00:01:21.330> rayon

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
are made out of plastic polyester rayon

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.320 
are made out of plastic polyester rayon
nylon<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.850> those<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.510> plastic<00:01:25.320> polymers

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
nylon all of those are plastic polymers

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
nylon all of those are plastic polymers
health-wise<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:28.140> also<00:01:28.430> experienced<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
health-wise I really also experienced a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
health-wise I really also experienced a
change<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.810> attribute<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.260> primarily<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
change and I attribute that primarily to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.450 
change and I attribute that primarily to
the<00:01:32.310> reduction<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:34.070> chemicals<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> were

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the reduction of chemicals that were

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630 
the reduction of chemicals that were
being<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.110> food<00:01:37.380> by<00:01:37.860> association

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
being put into my food by association

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.469 
being put into my food by association
the<00:01:38.850> FDA<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:40.229> over<00:01:40.760> 70,000<00:01:41.760> chemicals<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the FDA has over 70,000 chemicals that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.570 
the FDA has over 70,000 chemicals that
it<00:01:42.600> allows<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.320> proximity<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.189> food

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
it allows to be in proximity to our food

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.399 
it allows to be in proximity to our food
that<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.630> directly<00:01:46.170> regulated

that are not directly regulated

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.850 
that are not directly regulated
in<00:01:47.500> some<00:01:48.220> places<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.880> my<00:01:49.299> life<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.810> saved<00:01:50.320> quite

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
in some places of my life I saved quite

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.859 
in some places of my life I saved quite
a<00:01:50.920> bit<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.250> money<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.790> others<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.450> spent<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
a bit of money and others I spent a

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.530 
a bit of money and others I spent a
little<00:01:52.960> bit<00:01:53.110> more<00:01:53.290> bulk<00:01:54.280> items<00:01:54.640> are<00:01:54.939> usually

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
little bit more bulk items are usually

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.350 
little bit more bulk items are usually
fresher<00:01:55.840> they<00:01:56.650> are<00:01:57.130> more<00:01:57.880> related<00:01:58.150> to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
fresher they are more related to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.770 
fresher they are more related to
seasonality<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.530> really<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.850> better<00:02:01.420> for

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
seasonality and really just better for

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.160 
seasonality and really just better for
you<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:02.229> terms<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.979> how<00:02:03.610> they're<00:02:03.880> preserved<00:02:04.420> so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
you in terms of how they're preserved so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.810 
you in terms of how they're preserved so
it's<00:02:05.290> something<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.590> be<00:02:05.740> really<00:02:06.009> cognizant<00:02:06.549> of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
it's something to be really cognizant of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.630 
it's something to be really cognizant of
