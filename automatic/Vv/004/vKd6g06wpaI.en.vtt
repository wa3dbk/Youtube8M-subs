00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
ones more recently we tend to have

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.880 
ones more recently we tend to have
naming<00:02:23.459> competition<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.330> people<00:02:25.019> members<00:02:25.769> of

the public suggest names and and once
pictures<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.629> winner<00:02:30.840> they<00:02:31.319> also<00:02:31.500> have

pictures as the winner they also have

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.199 
pictures as the winner they also have
separate<00:02:32.160> names<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> keepers<00:02:33.060> will

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
separate names that the keepers will

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.880 
separate names that the keepers will
call<00:02:33.420> them<00:02:33.629> which<00:02:33.840> are<00:02:34.170> different<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.739> their

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
call them which are different to their

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.089 
call them which are different to their
public<00:02:35.069> names<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.870> when<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.950> keeper

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
public names so that when the keeper

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.339 
public names so that when the keeper
calls<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.640> there<00:02:38.910> their<00:02:39.269> name<00:02:39.540> they'll<00:02:39.959> react

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
calls out there their name they'll react

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.710 
calls out there their name they'll react
but<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.250> public<00:02:41.579> are<00:02:41.700> calling<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
but if all the public are calling out I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.229 
but if all the public are calling out I
guess<00:02:43.620> their<00:02:44.220> public<00:02:44.579> name<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> time

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
guess their public name all the time

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.390 
guess their public name all the time
then<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.870> gorillas<00:02:46.440> kind<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.799> tend<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> ignore

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
then the gorillas kind of tend to ignore

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.069 
then the gorillas kind of tend to ignore
that<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.970> keepers<00:02:48.299> have<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> special<00:02:48.900> name

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
that so the keepers have a special name

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.990 
that so the keepers have a special name
for<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.769> when<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.069> hear<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.310> they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
for them so when they hear that they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.460 
for them so when they hear that they
know<00:02:51.180> that

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.130 

did<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.520> do<00:02:57.580> exercise<00:03:00.240> yes<00:03:01.240> oh<00:03:01.450> yes<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:01.990> do

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
did I do exercise yes oh yes I do do

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.110 
did I do exercise yes oh yes I do do
