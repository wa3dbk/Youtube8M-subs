00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.860
 team today to meet rivals 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 so with little penetrative and 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.410
 run with salt because we have it 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.290

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.770
 first these rivals the truth that I 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.570
 15 is giving me a lot with the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 people who dressed telling the truth that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.920
 It's making me pretty hard for that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.920
 the match game is very occasionally 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 for the name but good very good 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 new venue play you know here we have the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 next very good play new status 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 we caught her , the rapport of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 new is going to take it out the bike 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 something our defense got out that it does 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 very well stepping on it and takes it 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 our defense again we try 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.360
 take out again the ball catch sack a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 Roulette our defense that garcía both 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 and we get the second 0-2 and there is a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 thing to say they were working them 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 tremendously good their by god and ni 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 soldiers with my players I committed suicide 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.399
 more could not happen here the next 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.649
 ball that hits the stick that 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.240
 played by jesé rodríguez who was not 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.340
 finishing scoring goals but I know that I 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:47.100
 he was liking he lacked the goal well 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.979
 often reject disc again 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 that from there he tried to prove anything 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.549
 reject I do not go with the pizza is the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.740
 drawback the pizza back the shot does not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.780
 I'm going to reject our center again 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.369
 of a again refuse to look at how 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 they were depending their power of 50 euros 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.319
 I had the Venus bus 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 new a shot our ball to corner 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.700
 it was incredible impossible to do anything 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 next moves the arrival of james 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.080
 James with a big left back 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.630
 king has not had to come again the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.549
 midfielder and the center of which he was flying 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.769
 all over the squad and you see at last 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.799
 minute 85 we put in a two gave 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.780
 hopes to the party was being a 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.129
 tremendous match since the opponent plays 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.620
 just with the bus and counterattack to 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.910
 pick up the ball to toxa and pulled out and was 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.680
 amazing how they were defending those 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.970
 players that are going to be again disc 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.450
 Pizza 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 rafa back and in the definition in the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.370
 90 minute 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.560
 Isco put us back in the game 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.600
 huge isco alarcón huge the player 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.579
 del real madrid what good play inside 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.550
 of the area after taking everything away 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.500
 above 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.690
 that the bus was imposed is 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.970
 awful but good next plays 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.150
 we were going to take it with language language 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.280
 for james rodríguez who was 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.780
 disappearing in these last matches 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640
 but hey, here he will go back to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.160
 take the con again with a bounce 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.860
 as you do not see yourself going back to take with another 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.690
 bounced and pulled that the sticked by the stick 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.670
 of the goalkeeper that goalkeeper would change 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.840
 and you have to change the defense a lot and 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.070
 I tell you that in the first ones 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.170
 next matches that we win then 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.450
 we will change porter and defenses because 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.580
 it has to be yes or yes 120 minutes of 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.520
 again add in a minute here comes the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.700
 last one to take again 2nd the pass 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.180
 isco again puts the 3 to 3 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.800
 Frisco's new record with the goal and eye 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.710
 to the party that will be called with our 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.970
 central I give thanks to him two goals 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.500
 huge 2 here the extension was over 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.090
 penalty time and we will live the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.550
 penalties the first of the veterans with 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.350
 MMIX antros media world and well 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.390
 up could not do anything his 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.010
 goalkeeper was quite selected that 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.470
 win this game as we improve our 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.570
 defense was essential and mandatory 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.810
 and very good stop of our goalkeeper 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.970
 bronze very well guessed if it is already 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.560
 Rodríguez and Jesé Rodríguez that I was going to 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.850
 tracing by the squad was over 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.180
 the site the goalie but not 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.730
 squad and here is where you will have 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.290
 this happens to put plays of 50 of 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.640
 average they do not know how to throw penalties and 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.140
 ball to the crossbar 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.690
 the next our was and I was 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.900
 I was quite there with that green claw 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.199
 but we managed to get in and there we go 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.419
 lie again happens to you by putting games 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.060
 50 on average to have handicap there 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.229
 the won we win the penalties by 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.639
 end match won was going to be the only 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.110
 episode party I wanted to be a 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.600
 Pretty pretty intense party 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.630
 enough work and others and good here 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.250
 let's put diego alves and valdés and 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.960
 we were also going to put that is almost there 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.669
 to give insight into others 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.990
 players 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:52.730
 this vision was very good very good 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.470
 and very good match that are being marked 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.030
 very good you are doing in general 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.500
 here we are going to see the baskets again of 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.870
 James who has five games and six 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.460
 goals and isco four games and five 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.710
 goals and a boss that is costing 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.030
 appear so nothing here is over the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.450
 today's episode I hope you have 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.220
 liked and a pretty game but that 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.110
 quite intense I will try to climb 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.640
 when they are so long matches then 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.770
 I will try to upload only one game so that 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.940
 the series is going to win more and see 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.100
 how about to see how about that because neither 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.810
 I'm having time to play a lot 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.250
 because the truth is that you play against these 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.900
 rivals because it ends up getting tired of hands 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.280
 and that nothing I hope you liked already 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.780
 you know that it is so you can leave a 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.060
 like to subscribe when you lose any 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.220
 another floor should do nothing else here 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.470
 I say goodbye to give love to this episode of 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.510
 James and ten more and we'll see each other 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.510
 following chao chao episodes
