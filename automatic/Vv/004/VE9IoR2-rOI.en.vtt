failure<00:01:47.930> huh<00:01:53.920> okay<00:01:54.920> let's<00:01:55.220> try<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
failure huh okay let's try it with the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.940 
failure huh okay let's try it with the
wick<00:01:55.970> under<00:01:56.570> it<00:02:02.110> probably<00:02:03.110> got<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.680> little

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
wick under it probably got just a little

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:18.160 
wick under it probably got just a little
free<00:02:04.190> heat<00:02:04.400> from<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.790> first<00:02:05.030> time<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:17.170> think

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
free heat from the first time I think

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.930 
free heat from the first time I think
that's<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.190> way<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.400> go<00:02:24.760> yeah

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
that's that's the way to go yeah

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.350 
that's that's the way to go yeah
she<00:02:26.209> caught<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.750> char<00:02:27.850> they<00:02:28.850> wick<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.239> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
she caught that char they wick on the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.590 
she caught that char they wick on the
elbow<00:02:29.720> ain't<00:02:29.959> gonna<00:02:30.200> don't<00:02:30.920> put<00:02:31.130> enough<00:02:31.430> heat

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.479 

maybe<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.930> or<00:02:36.050> two<00:02:36.230> rounds<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.190> pipe

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
maybe one or two rounds on the pipe

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.130 
maybe one or two rounds on the pipe
itself<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.959> then<00:02:40.330> put<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> little<00:02:41.540> bit<00:02:41.750> work<00:02:41.959> on

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
itself and then put a little bit work on

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.040 
itself and then put a little bit work on
this<00:02:42.290> area<00:02:42.560> instead<00:02:43.130> maybe<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.730> doubt<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.300> but

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.640 

ya<00:02:51.050> got<00:02:51.290> more<00:02:51.890> fine<00:02:52.280> than<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.700> needed

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
ya got more fine than I needed

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.330 
ya got more fine than I needed

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
so Salih Saleh get used to your stove

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.180 
so Salih Saleh get used to your stove
you<00:02:58.820> don't<00:02:59.030> need<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.390> bigger<00:02:59.660> friend<00:02:59.989> that's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
you don't need that bigger friend that's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.670 
you don't need that bigger friend that's
it<00:03:01.190> looks<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.700> way<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.850> go

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it looks like the way to go

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.620 
it looks like the way to go
let's<00:03:03.680> see<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:04.550> she'll<00:03:04.760> keep<00:03:05.000> burning<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
let's see if she'll keep burning when a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.039 
let's see if she'll keep burning when a
primer<00:03:06.500> goes<00:03:06.800> out

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:40.440 

yeah<00:03:15.049> we<00:03:15.319> burn<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.189> wood<00:03:16.340> too

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.610 

well<00:03:41.450> that's<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.840> hot<00:03:44.050> okay<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.290> time<00:03:45.320> I'm

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
well that's a hot okay this time I'm

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.510 
well that's a hot okay this time I'm
gonna<00:03:45.800> try<00:03:46.100> mr.<00:03:46.870> Hamid<00:03:47.870> Cook's<00:03:48.200> idea<00:03:49.160> putting

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
gonna try mr. Hamid Cook's idea putting

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.050 
gonna try mr. Hamid Cook's idea putting
putting<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.630> holes<00:03:50.810> on<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.170> bottom<00:03:51.320> I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
putting the holes on the bottom I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.760 
putting the holes on the bottom I
drilled<00:03:53.060> them<00:03:53.240> I<00:03:53.360> didn't<00:03:53.630> hide<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.960> didn't

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
drilled them I didn't hide it didn't

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.860 
drilled them I didn't hide it didn't

slide I'm I didn't have time it's cold
out<00:03:57.080> here<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.470> all<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.710> good<00:03:57.890> stuff<00:03:57.950> then

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
out here and all this good stuff then

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.870 
out here and all this good stuff then
we're<00:03:58.970> going<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.180> use<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.600> the<00:04:00.520> bottom<00:04:01.520> primer

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
we're going to use the the bottom primer

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.630 
we're going to use the the bottom primer
wick<00:04:02.270> which<00:04:03.140> is<00:04:03.320> gonna<00:04:03.560> go<00:04:03.740> right<00:04:03.920> up<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.340> there

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
wick which is gonna go right up in there

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.760 
wick which is gonna go right up in there
and<00:04:04.850> probably<00:04:05.330> heat<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.660> alcohol<00:04:06.140> faster<00:04:06.650> now

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
and probably heat the alcohol faster now

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
a try

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.690 
a try
all<00:04:12.170> right<00:04:12.500> we'll<00:04:12.800> climb<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.280> up<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.640> time

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
all right we'll climb it up this time

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.090 
all right we'll climb it up this time
and<00:04:13.970> hope<00:04:14.330> we<00:04:14.480> don't<00:04:14.600> get<00:04:14.870> too<00:04:15.080> much<00:04:15.290> let's<00:04:15.680> add

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
and hope we don't get too much let's add

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.490 
and hope we don't get too much let's add
too<00:04:16.280> much<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.670> primer<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:17.450> try<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.140> that

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
too much of a primer that's try it that

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.440 
too much of a primer that's try it that
way<00:04:18.760> see<00:04:19.760> what<00:04:19.940> happens<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.640> my<00:04:23.060> elbows<00:04:23.420> a

way see what happens and my elbows a
little<00:04:23.600> crooked<00:04:23.930> man<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:25.150> don't<00:04:26.150> think<00:04:26.390> it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
little crooked man I don't think it

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:47.300 
little crooked man I don't think it
makes<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.050> much<00:04:27.110> difference

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.450 

unless<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.550> started<00:04:49.000> up<00:04:49.150> fast<00:04:50.219> but<00:04:51.219> that

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
unless you started up fast but that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.589 
unless you started up fast but that
don't<00:04:51.669> mean<00:04:51.849> nothing<00:04:52.330> does<00:04:52.509> it<00:04:57.060> too<00:04:58.060> much<00:04:58.210> farm

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
don't mean nothing does it too much farm

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:14.330 
don't mean nothing does it too much farm
again<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.050> think

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.020 

I<00:05:15.350> can<00:05:16.350> hear<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.590> sizzling<00:05:17.220> she<00:05:17.550> boiling

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030
