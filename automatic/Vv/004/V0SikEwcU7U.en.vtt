the<00:00:34.690> school<00:00:35.050> killing<00:00:35.470> them<00:00:35.829> in<00:00:36.100> which<00:00:36.760> way

the school killing them in which way
well<00:00:38.550> schools<00:00:39.550> sometimes<00:00:40.270> ignore<00:00:40.720> them<00:00:40.899> I

well schools sometimes ignore them I

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.729 
well schools sometimes ignore them I
would<00:00:41.890> say<00:00:42.720> part<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:43.870> argument<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
would say part of the argument of the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.410 
would say part of the argument of the
book<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:45.129> that<00:00:45.160> we<00:00:45.519> all<00:00:45.640> have<00:00:45.670> very<00:00:45.969> different

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
book is that we all have very different

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.520 
book is that we all have very different
talents<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.940> show<00:00:49.899> themselves<00:00:50.079> in<00:00:50.410> all

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
talents and they show themselves in all

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.840 
talents and they show themselves in all
sorts<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.859> different<00:00:50.949> areas<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.519> know<00:00:51.699> for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
sorts of different areas you know for

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.939 
sorts of different areas you know for
some<00:00:52.000> people<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:53.050> may<00:00:53.199> be<00:00:53.260> science<00:00:53.739> or

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
some people it may be science or

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.349 
some people it may be science or
mathematics<00:00:54.160> for<00:00:54.730> other<00:00:54.850> people<00:00:55.090> it<00:00:55.179> may<00:00:55.300> be

mathematics for other people it may be

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.740 
mathematics for other people it may be
dance<00:00:55.660> or<00:00:55.929> music<00:00:56.289> I<00:00:56.649> always<00:00:57.309> think<00:00:57.579> of<00:00:57.750> human

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
dance or music I always think of human

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.110 
dance or music I always think of human
talents<00:00:59.199> like<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.829> Earth's<00:01:00.219> natural

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
talents like the Earth's natural

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.439 
talents like the Earth's natural
resources<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.829> know<00:01:02.920> they<00:01:03.100> may<00:01:03.850> be<00:01:03.879> there<00:01:04.210> but

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
resources you know they may be there but

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.000 
resources you know they may be there but
you<00:01:04.570> may<00:01:04.690> never<00:01:04.839> discover<00:01:05.080> them<00:01:05.410> they<00:01:05.800> may<00:01:05.950> be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
you may never discover them they may be

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.050 
you may never discover them they may be
buried<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.960> may<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.070> work<00:01:09.220> hard<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.820> find

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
buried you may have to work hard to find

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.830 
buried you may have to work hard to find
them<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.860> schools<00:01:12.000> tend<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.180> focus<00:01:13.330> on<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.690> very

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
them and schools tend to focus on a very

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.150 
them and schools tend to focus on a very
narrow<00:01:14.700> idea<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.880> ability<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:18.070> know

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
narrow idea of ability you know

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.010 
narrow idea of ability you know
particularly<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:19.240> certain<00:01:19.600> sort<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.870> academic

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
particularly a certain sort of academic

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.640 
particularly a certain sort of academic
work<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.090> why<00:01:22.320> students<00:01:23.320> at<00:01:23.410> schools

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
work so it's why students at schools

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.220 
work so it's why students at schools
spend<00:01:23.920> most<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.310> time<00:01:24.580> writing<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.660> sitting

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
spend most that time writing and sitting

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.440 
spend most that time writing and sitting
down<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.770> I'm<00:01:27.730> not<00:01:27.850> saying<00:01:28.150> those<00:01:28.300> things

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
down and I'm not saying those things

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.820 
down and I'm not saying those things
aren't<00:01:28.690> important<00:01:29.170> but<00:01:29.290> they're<00:01:29.410> not<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
aren't important but they're not the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.470 
aren't important but they're not the
whole<00:01:29.980> of<00:01:30.010> human<00:01:30.370> talent<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:30.910> so<00:01:31.120> schools

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
whole of human talent and so schools

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.920 
whole of human talent and so schools
often<00:01:32.290> ignore<00:01:32.880> young<00:01:33.880> people's<00:01:34.240> real<00:01:34.450> talents

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
often ignore young people's real talents

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.970 
often ignore young people's real talents
and<00:01:35.050> they<00:01:35.170> therefore<00:01:35.380> may<00:01:35.620> never<00:01:35.830> discover

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
and they therefore may never discover

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.770 
and they therefore may never discover
them

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.360 

you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.870> I<00:01:42.900> think<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.160> need<00:01:44.190> a

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
you know I think that we do need a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.540 
you know I think that we do need a
revolution<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.330> education<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> change<00:01:47.370> is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
revolution in education so the change is

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.100 
revolution in education so the change is
beginning<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:47.940> happen<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:48.810> it'll

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
beginning to happen and I think it'll

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.550 
beginning to happen and I think it'll
get<00:01:49.260> faster<00:01:49.880> are<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> teachers<00:01:51.540> helping<00:01:52.410> on

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
get faster are the teachers helping on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.490 
get faster are the teachers helping on
that<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.600> well<00:01:54.600> somehow<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.900> some

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that or not well somehow and and some

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.720 
that or not well somehow and and some
aren't<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.100> complicated<00:01:59.340> system

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
aren't it's a very complicated system

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.820 
aren't it's a very complicated system
and<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.690> have<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.870> look<00:02:01.080> at<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.680> there

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and you have to look at you know there

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.200 
and you have to look at you know there
are<00:02:01.920> trends<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.550> patterns<00:02:02.760> in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
are trends there are patterns in

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
are trends there are patterns in
different<00:02:03.300> countries<00:02:03.750> around<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.080> world

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
different countries around the world

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
different countries around the world
you<00:02:04.800> know<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.100> you're<00:02:05.370> right<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:05.760> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you know but you're right there are a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
you know but you're right there are a
lot<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> people<00:02:06.090> education<00:02:06.660> have<00:02:06.810> been<00:02:06.960> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
lot of people education have been in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
lot of people education have been in
this<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.860> long<00:02:07.980> time<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.700> don't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
this for a very long time and they don't

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.120 
this for a very long time and they don't
necessarily<00:02:09.510> see<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.290> need<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.470> change<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
necessarily see the need for change and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.380 
necessarily see the need for change and
don't<00:02:11.250> necessarily<00:02:11.610> feel<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.210> well

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
don't necessarily feel very well

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.120 
don't necessarily feel very well
equipped<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.170> bring<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.410> change<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:13.860> even

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
equipped to bring the change about even

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
equipped to bring the change about even
if<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.340> were<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.460> understand<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> think

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
if they were to understand it so I think

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.480 
if they were to understand it so I think
there's<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> big<00:02:16.140> generational<00:02:16.740> shift<00:02:17.040> that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
there's a big generational shift that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.760 
there's a big generational shift that
will<00:02:17.640> happen<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.230> generation

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
will happen I think as this generation

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710 
will happen I think as this generation
of<00:02:19.890> young<00:02:20.520> people<00:02:20.550> moves<00:02:21.240> through<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.570> system

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of young people moves through the system

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.530 
of young people moves through the system
you<00:02:22.140> may<00:02:22.260> well<00:02:22.470> find<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.940> whole<00:02:24.060> context

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
you may well find that the whole context

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.330 
you may well find that the whole context
will<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.750> changed<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.740> have<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
will have changed and they all have a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
will have changed and they all have a
different<00:02:27.120> set<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> aptitudes<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> energies

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
different set of aptitudes and energies

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.830 
different set of aptitudes and energies
to<00:02:28.800> bring<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.160> shift<00:02:35.750> creativity<00:02:36.750> is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
to bring to this shift creativity is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.760 
to bring to this shift creativity is
bring<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:38.220> imagination<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> work<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
bring your imagination to work and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.160 
bring your imagination to work and
sometimes<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:41.340> an<00:02:42.030> individual<00:02:42.600> effort<00:02:42.960> and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
sometimes it's an individual effort and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.590 
sometimes it's an individual effort and
sometimes<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.890> evolves<00:02:44.250> collaboration<00:02:44.910> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
sometimes it evolves collaboration it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.570 
sometimes it evolves collaboration it
almost<00:02:45.900> always<00:02:46.200> involves<00:02:47.010> being<00:02:47.160> influenced

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
another even people who work alone are

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.310 
another even people who work alone are
usually<00:02:54.000> conscious<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.870> other<00:02:54.959> people<00:02:55.260> who

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
worked in the same field so there's a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
worked in the same field so there's a
kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.390> dialogue<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.590> lot<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.890> creative

kind of dialogue in a lot of creative

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.410 
kind of dialogue in a lot of creative
processes<00:02:59.580> whether<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.970> actually<00:03:00.390> a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
processes whether it's actually a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.770 
processes whether it's actually a
dialogue<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.820> it's<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:03.000> kind<00:03:03.690> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
dialogue like this or it's a kind of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
dialogue like this or it's a kind of
internal<00:03:04.470> conversation<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.190> what's<00:03:05.400> you've

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
internal conversation with what's you've

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.000 
internal conversation with what's you've
already<00:03:05.940> seen<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.600> experienced<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.320> think<00:03:07.950> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
already seen and experienced I think of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.250 
already seen and experienced I think of
innovation<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.940> putting<00:03:09.180> good<00:03:09.390> ideas<00:03:09.750> into

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
innovation as putting good ideas into

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.740 
innovation as putting good ideas into
practice<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.950> think<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.530> there's<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.620> huge

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
practice I think that the there's a huge

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
practice I think that the there's a huge
area<00:03:15.750> for<00:03:16.340> innovation<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.640> organize

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
area for innovation how we organize

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150 
area for innovation how we organize
schools<00:03:18.510> internally<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.260> mean<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.130> example

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
schools internally I mean for example

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.770 
schools internally I mean for example
most<00:03:20.610> schools<00:03:20.850> are<00:03:21.000> still<00:03:21.150> organized<00:03:21.570> by

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
most schools are still organized by

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.970 
most schools are still organized by
subjects<00:03:23.180> they<00:03:24.380> divide<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> day<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.770> into

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
subjects they divide the day up into

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.890 
subjects they divide the day up into
small<00:03:26.220> bits<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.880> know<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> 40<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.450> 50<00:03:27.780> minutes

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
small bits you know to 40 or 50 minutes

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.320 
small bits you know to 40 or 50 minutes
and<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.260> ring<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.500> bell<00:03:28.650> every<00:03:29.610> 50<00:03:30.060> minutes

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
and they ring a bell every 50 minutes

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.670 
and they ring a bell every 50 minutes
you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.660> I've<00:03:30.959> seen<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.260> recently<00:03:31.440> if

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
you know I've seen this recently if

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.660 
you know I've seen this recently if
you're<00:03:31.830> running<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.160> business<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.520> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you're running a business like that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.420 
you're running a business like that
you'd<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.120> bankrupt<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> week<00:03:34.050> know<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:35.010> you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
you'd be bankrupt in a week know if you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.760 
you'd be bankrupt in a week know if you
had<00:03:35.580> 2,000<00:03:36.300> employees<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.959> every<00:03:37.170> 40<00:03:37.470> minutes

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
had 2,000 employees in every 40 minutes

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
had 2,000 employees in every 40 minutes
they<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.700> stop<00:03:38.910> what<00:03:39.060> they<00:03:39.180> were<00:03:39.209> doing

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
they have to stop what they were doing

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.550 
they have to stop what they were doing
and<00:03:39.600> go<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.870> different<00:03:40.140> room<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.500> do

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and go to a different room and do

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.530 
and go to a different room and do
something<00:03:40.860> else<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.160> 40<00:03:41.430> minutes<00:03:41.610> with<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
something else for 40 minutes with a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.850 
something else for 40 minutes with a
different<00:03:42.840> group<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.050> people<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.590> then

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
different group of people and then

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.500 
different group of people and then
repeat<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.430> six<00:03:44.760> times<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.120> day<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.450> mean

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
repeat that six times a day I mean

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.940 
repeat that six times a day I mean
they're<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:45.959> be<00:03:46.050> demoralized<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.739> wouldn't

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
they're just be demoralized it wouldn't

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.500 
they're just be demoralized it wouldn't
you'd<00:03:47.070> never<00:03:47.220> get<00:03:47.400> anything<00:03:47.430> done<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:48.299> we<00:03:48.420> do

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
you'd never get anything done but we do

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.110 
you'd never get anything done but we do
it<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.690> schools<00:03:48.989> all<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.200> time<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.730> think<00:03:50.790> if

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
it in schools all the time so I think if

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.060 
it in schools all the time so I think if
you<00:03:51.239> organize<00:03:51.480> scores<00:03:52.320> all<00:03:52.769> learning

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
you organize scores all learning

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.870 
you organize scores all learning
communities

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
communities

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.220 
communities
the<00:03:54.090> nature<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> tasks<00:03:54.960> that<00:03:55.020> you're

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the nature of the tasks that you're

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.410 
the nature of the tasks that you're
asking<00:03:55.470> people<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.770> do<00:03:55.970> you'd<00:03:56.970> see<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> very

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
asking people to do you'd see a very

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.520 
asking people to do you'd see a very
different<00:03:57.690> kind<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.900> dynamic<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.410> mean

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
different kind of dynamic I mean

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.200 
different kind of dynamic I mean
sometimes<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.430> want<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.640> spend<00:03:59.880> all<00:04:00.030> day

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
sometimes you want to spend all day

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.550 
sometimes you want to spend all day
working<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.720> project<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.200> sometimes

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
working on the project and sometimes

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
working on the project and sometimes
just<00:04:01.740> need<00:04:01.890> 15<00:04:02.280> minutes<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.610> do<00:04:02.730> something<00:04:03.000> in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
just need 15 minutes to do something in

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.820 
just need 15 minutes to do something in
particular<00:04:03.180> at<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.320> moment<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:04.710> all

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
particular at the moment it's all

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.850 
particular at the moment it's all
organized<00:04:05.730> around<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.810> schedule<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.680> try

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
organized around the schedule and we try

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.740 
organized around the schedule and we try
to<00:04:07.890> fit<00:04:08.130> everything<00:04:08.340> else<00:04:08.610> into<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:14.750> great

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
to fit everything else into it a great
