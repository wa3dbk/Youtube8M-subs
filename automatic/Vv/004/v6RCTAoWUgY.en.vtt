you a quick bit of history about the 87
442<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.700> came<00:01:58.700> from<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.060> factory<00:01:59.570> with<00:01:59.780> a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
442 here came from the factory with a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.320 
442 here came from the factory with a
307<00:02:00.740> small-block<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:02.290> 200<00:02:03.290> r4<00:02:03.650> rear<00:02:03.920> a

307 small-block and 200 r4 rear a
small-block<00:02:05.330> had<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.630> hydraulic<00:02:06.260> roller<00:02:06.409> cam

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
small-block had a hydraulic roller cam

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.359 
small-block had a hydraulic roller cam
that<00:02:07.610> packed<00:02:07.909> out<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.360> meager<00:02:09.009> 170<00:02:10.009> horsepower

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that packed out a meager 170 horsepower

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.690 
that packed out a meager 170 horsepower
and<00:02:10.849> 250<00:02:11.750> foot-pounds<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.319> torque

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and 250 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.030 
and 250 foot-pounds of torque
now<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.760> compare<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.470> 1970<00:02:15.470> when<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
now you compare that to 1970 when a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
now you compare that to 1970 when a
small-block<00:02:16.490> would<00:02:16.760> give<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.180> 325

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
small-block would give you about 325

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and 360 foot-pounds of torque you'll see

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
means an original build there are a ton

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
of big block G bodies out there but this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.559 
of big block G bodies out there but this
is<00:03:12.709> an<00:03:12.829> excellent<00:03:13.250> first<00:03:13.670> build<00:03:14.030> project

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
is an excellent first build project

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.539 
is an excellent first build project
which<00:03:14.870> consists<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.440> mostly<00:03:15.650> both<00:03:16.129> ons<00:03:16.400> that

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
which consists of mostly both ons that

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.220 
which consists of mostly both ons that
can<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.879> performed<00:03:17.389> with<00:03:17.510> ordinary<00:03:17.870> hand

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
can be performed with ordinary hand

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
can be performed with ordinary hand
tools<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.819> can<00:03:19.849> do<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.239> in<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.389> two-car

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
tools and you can do it in a two-car

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.690 
tools and you can do it in a two-car
garage<00:03:21.109> without<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:22.099> team<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.549> Master

Craftsmen and a ton of money on some

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.039 
Craftsmen and a ton of money on some
small<00:03:26.060> fortune<00:03:26.540> budget<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.730> think<00:03:29.209> for<00:03:29.989> a

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
small fortune budget so I think for a

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.229 
small fortune budget so I think for a
starting<00:03:30.470> point<00:03:30.680> for<00:03:31.010> your<00:03:31.430> average<00:03:31.639> builder

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
starting point for your average builder

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.460 
starting point for your average builder
with<00:03:32.810> hand<00:03:33.079> tools<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.980> garage<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.970> no<00:03:35.120> lift

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
with hand tools in a garage with no lift

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.809 
with hand tools in a garage with no lift
this<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.650> going<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.889> be<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.040> good<00:03:37.220> project<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
this is going to be a good project to

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.289 
this is going to be a good project to
learn<00:03:38.060> something<00:03:38.510> from<00:03:38.980> anyway<00:03:39.980> as<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:41.150> go

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
learn something from anyway as we go

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.750 
learn something from anyway as we go
through<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.840> hope<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.410> enjoyed<00:03:42.799> this<00:03:43.010> build<00:03:43.340> as
