00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
reasons one its super anti inflammatory

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.029 
reasons one its super anti inflammatory
for<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.600> reason<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:30.079> don't<00:01:30.320> recommend<00:01:30.680> taking

it within three hours of a workout

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.350 
it within three hours of a workout
because<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:34.070> don't<00:01:34.340> want<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.610> shut<00:01:34.939> any<00:01:35.179> of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
insulin sensitive sensitivity all the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.559 
insulin sensitive sensitivity all the
time<00:04:09.110> because<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:09.890> is<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.280> key<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.970> making

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
time because that is the key to making

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.740

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
sure that you're building muscle and not

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.539 
sure that you're building muscle and not
putting<00:04:14.750> on<00:04:14.840> fat<00:04:15.220> making<00:04:16.220> sure<00:04:16.280> that

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
putting on fat making sure that

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.219 
putting on fat making sure that
nutrients<00:04:17.239> are<00:04:17.329> actually<00:04:17.630> getting<00:04:17.840> into<00:04:18.140> the

nutrients are actually getting into the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.129 
nutrients are actually getting into the
cells<00:04:18.500> so<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.700> make<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.060> fish<00:04:20.239> oil<00:04:20.419> really

under<00:04:48.289> stress<00:04:48.410> your<00:04:49.250> body<00:04:49.280> does<00:04:49.669> not<00:04:49.700> want<00:04:50.030> to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
under stress your body does not want to

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.210 
under stress your body does not want to
build<00:04:50.240> build<00:04:50.750> muscle<00:04:51.169> all<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.680> wants<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.919> do<00:04:52.070> is

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
build build muscle all it wants to do is

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.920 
build build muscle all it wants to do is
really<00:04:52.250> store<00:04:52.729> fat<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.419> take<00:04:53.600> care<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.780> those

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
really store fat to take care of those

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.110 
really store fat to take care of those
toxins<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.310> they<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.550> be<00:04:55.610> stored<00:04:55.880> in

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
toxins so that they can be stored in

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.260 
toxins so that they can be stored in
someplace<00:04:56.810> away<00:04:57.080> from<00:04:57.380> your<00:04:57.530> internal<00:04:57.919> organs

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
someplace away from your internal organs

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.450 
someplace away from your internal organs
so<00:04:59.270> alpha<00:05:00.140> lipoic<00:05:00.410> acid<00:05:00.620> helps<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.310> detoxify

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
so alpha lipoic acid helps to detoxify

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.440 
so alpha lipoic acid helps to detoxify
you<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.270> increases<00:05:03.200> insulin<00:05:03.380> sensitivity

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
you and increases insulin sensitivity

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.400 
you and increases insulin sensitivity
number<00:05:05.450> for<00:05:05.690> magnesium<00:05:06.289> oh<00:05:06.740> as<00:05:07.310> far<00:05:08.060> as<00:05:08.090> a

number for magnesium oh as far as a

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.690 
number for magnesium oh as far as a
dosages<00:05:09.410> I'll<00:05:09.590> go<00:05:09.950> with<00:05:09.979> dosages<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
dosages I'll go with dosages in the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.450 
dosages I'll go with dosages in the
battle<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.210> after<00:05:12.080> all<00:05:12.289> this<00:05:12.710> I'll<00:05:12.979> go<00:05:13.310> at<00:05:13.370> it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
battle but after all this I'll go at it

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.810 
battle but after all this I'll go at it
at<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.970> end<00:05:14.320> magnesium<00:05:15.320> magnesium<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:16.400> really

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
at the end magnesium magnesium is really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.770 
at the end magnesium magnesium is really
good<00:05:17.000> for<00:05:17.419> building<00:05:17.600> muscle<00:05:17.930> energy<00:05:19.780> helps

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
good for building muscle energy helps

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.650 
good for building muscle energy helps
with<00:05:20.960> cardiovascular<00:05:21.680> function<00:05:22.250> so<00:05:23.240> it's

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
with cardiovascular function so it's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.940 
with cardiovascular function so it's
really<00:05:23.900> going<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.050> help<00:05:24.140> you<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.800> have

really going to help you to have
endurance<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.580> get<00:05:25.729> through<00:05:25.880> those<00:05:26.000> workouts

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
endurance to get through those workouts

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.330 
endurance to get through those workouts
and<00:05:26.600> it's<00:05:26.870> really<00:05:27.169> going<00:05:27.350> to<00:05:27.410> help<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.770> with

and it's really going to help you with

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.940 
and it's really going to help you with
your<00:05:28.370> build-up<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.970> adenosine<00:05:29.950> triphosphate

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
your build-up of adenosine triphosphate

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.650 
your build-up of adenosine triphosphate
it'll<00:05:31.250> help<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.520> with<00:05:31.669> your<00:05:31.820> ATP<00:05:32.120> side

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
it'll help you with your ATP side

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.190 
it'll help you with your ATP side
so<00:05:33.470> you'll<00:05:33.650> have<00:05:33.830> more<00:05:34.580> brute<00:05:35.360> force<00:05:35.660> put<00:05:36.050> onto

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
so you'll have more brute force put onto

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.250 
so you'll have more brute force put onto
the<00:05:36.410> weights<00:05:36.620> as<00:05:37.160> far<00:05:37.460> as<00:05:37.550> dosages<00:05:38.030> go<00:05:38.260> for

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
the weights as far as dosages go for

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.140 
the weights as far as dosages go for
