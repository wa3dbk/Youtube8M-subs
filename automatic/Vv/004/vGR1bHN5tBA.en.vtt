the alternator inverter it's it's really
a<00:00:35.620> brand<00:00:35.890> new<00:00:36.100> technology<00:00:36.579> for<00:00:37.329> us<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.739> as<00:00:38.890> we

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
a brand new technology for us so as we

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.430 
a brand new technology for us so as we
work<00:00:39.399> with<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.670> different<00:00:39.940> bus<00:00:40.329> OMS<00:00:41.140> they<00:00:41.260> all

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
work with the different bus OMS they all

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.799 
work with the different bus OMS they all
have<00:00:41.920> some<00:00:42.190> unique<00:00:42.609> features<00:00:42.879> to<00:00:43.690> the

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
have some unique features to the

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.899 
have some unique features to the
application<00:00:44.589> so<00:00:44.829> we<00:00:44.979> have<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.219> modify<00:00:45.670> what

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
application so we have to modify what

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.200 
application so we have to modify what
we're<00:00:46.120> doing<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.649> transit<00:00:48.370> as<00:00:48.489> well<00:00:48.550> as

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
we're doing to the transit as well as

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.399 
we're doing to the transit as well as
working<00:00:49.870> with<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.229> bus<00:00:50.620> OEMs<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.839> this<00:00:52.839> system

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
working with the bus OEMs in this system

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.219 
working with the bus OEMs in this system
we<00:00:53.559> have<00:00:53.799> compressors<00:00:54.549> on<00:00:55.479> each<00:00:55.659> side<00:00:55.960> and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
we have compressors on each side and

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.959 
we have compressors on each side and
that<00:00:56.289> helps<00:00:56.769> again<00:00:57.069> with<00:00:57.309> balancing

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
that helps again with balancing

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.639 
that helps again with balancing
performance<00:00:58.719> versus<00:00:59.049> their<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.469> load

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
performance versus their the load

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.020 
performance versus their the load
requirements<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:00.399> as<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.729> ambient

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
requirements so as the ambient

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.879 
requirements so as the ambient
temperature<00:01:01.329> varies<00:01:01.989> inside<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.709> load

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
temperature varies inside the load

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.560 
temperature varies inside the load
requirements<00:01:03.549> and<00:01:03.670> cooling<00:01:03.999> requirement

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
requirements and cooling requirement

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.840 
requirements and cooling requirement
demand<00:01:04.869> on<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.170> system<00:01:05.560> changes<00:01:06.039> because

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
demand on the system changes because

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.969 
demand on the system changes because
it's<00:01:07.090> electric<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.869> maintains<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.770> constant

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
it's electric it maintains a constant

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's electric it maintains a constant
temperature<00:01:09.570> regardless<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.899> idle<00:01:11.229> speed

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
temperature regardless of the idle speed

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.980 
temperature regardless of the idle speed
so<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:12.100> passengers<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.909> more<00:01:13.149> comfort<00:01:13.479> they

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
so the passengers have more comfort they

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.410 
so the passengers have more comfort they
have<00:01:14.110> constant<00:01:14.560> cooling<00:01:14.939> regardless<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.119> the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
have constant cooling regardless of the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.749 
have constant cooling regardless of the
engine<00:01:16.869> speed<00:01:17.079> that's<00:01:17.799> very<00:01:18.039> critical<00:01:18.280> we

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
engine speed that's very critical we

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.120 
engine speed that's very critical we

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
cannot run a bus without a AC here in

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.160 
cannot run a bus without a AC here in
Miami<00:01:21.549> I<00:01:21.880> think<00:01:22.420> they're<00:01:22.570> gonna<00:01:22.719> get<00:01:22.960> their

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
expected savings of 25 to 28 percent

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.830
