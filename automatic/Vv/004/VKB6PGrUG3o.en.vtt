00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello i will show you today 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.069
 how to save water at home 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.650
 very easily and this in two ways 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.559
 the first relates to a faucet 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 like this one is the second one 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.359
 relates to a flush for that which 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.810
 regards the faucet we're just going 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.250
 change a faucet piece in fact he 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.590
 is there that filter 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.710
 water and that avoids putting too much 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.689
 particles in the water and we will replace 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 this piece by let's say 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 at first glance an identical piece but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 this is called a foamer this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.210
 who will do that water will not be 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 as there we see a trickle of water but 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 will be filled with micro air bubbles and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 so the efficiency to wash the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.270
 hands or clean will replace the same 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 but will drastically reduce the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.410
 water flow is therefore a water saving 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 to do this there are two possibilities 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.070
 either we just unscrew the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 manu system either one uses a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 clip like mine it's like that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 where a multifunctional plier or the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.270
 clip by or from where the tool suitable for 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
 simply unscrew the filmmaker roll a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.400
 so mine are simply unscrewed 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 the hand goes along the davis I'm going to put the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.420
 foamer system instead just the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.729
 high school here on the other hand of course as I 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.659
 do it by hand I can it's 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 until the end of course without forcing too much 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.180
 still 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.659
 and from there we see the difference 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.280
 the system the system is filled with 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.170
 air bubbles so here is the first 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.369
 technique to save water I 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 so let's introduce the second 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 trick that is of course at the level 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.740
 toilets for flushing for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.149
 do this we see lives that's the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.829
 system is removed faience here so 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.170
 open flush 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.880
 we have the first system 8 purely of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 flush to evacuate water 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.799
 to the toilet and the second 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.049
 system that is connected by water with 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.329
 a little tap so here so we see 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.220
 the system that goes into the hunt 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.030
 of water and the system of floats which in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.310
 below 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.170
 in the float and unbiased the outfit 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 by a small rod that can be aimed at or 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.090
 unscrew from there when we screw 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860
 the float will go up and when 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.650
 unscrews leveaux floats will go down 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 this float finally allows to regulate the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.239
 height of water containing flush 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.880
 that is, if I go down there 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.739
 will have from there - 2 liters for 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.970
 fill the hunt doubt of course if I 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.800
 make it go up screwing from 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980
 there machado fills up as we have 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.620
 long time to save water it goes 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 so must have davis is slightly 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.269
 unscrewed slightly allowing service 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.920
 to bring down the float it will take 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.019
 get me down but 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.670
 not too much for the purpose of the hunt 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.170
 of water works from lamps while 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.819
 even win a few cents or 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.530
 liters following the use of 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.160
 bathroom 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.160
 Thank you and see you soon
