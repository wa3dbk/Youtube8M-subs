I hold my pic like this I also hold it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.190 
I hold my pic like this I also hold it
very<00:00:27.670> relaxed<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.360> pic<00:00:28.539> can<00:00:28.690> be<00:00:28.810> removed

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
very relaxed so the pic can be removed

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.890 
very relaxed so the pic can be removed
easily<00:00:29.350> and<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.970> lot<00:00:31.150> of<00:00:31.240> people<00:00:31.510> hold<00:00:31.690> their

easily and a lot of people hold their
pic<00:00:32.280> with<00:00:33.280> our<00:00:33.430> first<00:00:33.640> finger<00:00:33.820> pointed<00:00:34.329> down

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
pic with our first finger pointed down

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.410 
pic with our first finger pointed down
some<00:00:35.650> will<00:00:35.829> also<00:00:36.160> hold<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.550> with<00:00:36.910> two<00:00:36.940> fingers

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
some will also hold it with two fingers

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.950 
some will also hold it with two fingers
on<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:37.930> front<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.710> thumb<00:00:38.920> on<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.100> back<00:00:39.340> I

on the front and the thumb on the back I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
on the front and the thumb on the back I
like<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.079> hold<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.440> pic<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:43.329> this<00:00:43.660> with<00:00:43.930> my

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
like to hold the pic like this with my

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.370 
like to hold the pic like this with my
thumb<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.489> first<00:00:45.670> finger<00:00:45.850> crossed<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.810> the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
thumb and first finger crossed and the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.040 
thumb and first finger crossed and the
pic<00:00:47.590> placed<00:00:48.160> here<00:00:48.579> with<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.030> medium<00:00:49.450> extension

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
pic placed here with a medium extension

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.190 
pic placed here with a medium extension
let's<00:00:51.010> talk<00:00:51.190> about<00:00:51.340> that<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.970> suggest<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.870> medium

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
let's talk about that I suggest a medium

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.920 
let's talk about that I suggest a medium
extension<00:00:54.090> however<00:00:55.090> some<00:00:55.390> people<00:00:55.540> use<00:00:55.899> a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
extension however some people use a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.709 
extension however some people use a
larger<00:00:56.559> pic<00:00:56.800> extension<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.579> then<00:00:58.480> some

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
larger pic extension and then some

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.530 
larger pic extension and then some
people<00:00:58.989> use<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.530> smaller<00:01:00.489> pic<00:01:00.910> extension

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
people use a smaller pic extension

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.540 
people use a smaller pic extension
whichever<00:01:02.320> one<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.620> best<00:01:02.890> for<00:01:03.040> your<00:01:03.280> balance

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
whichever one is best for your balance

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.209 
whichever one is best for your balance
but<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.119> prefer<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:04.629> medium<00:01:05.140> pic<00:01:05.560> extension<00:01:06.100> on

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
but I prefer a medium pic extension on

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.710 
but I prefer a medium pic extension on
the<00:01:06.310> pic<00:01:06.549> grip

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 

let's<00:01:10.720> talk<00:01:10.900> about<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.260> right<00:01:11.409> hand<00:01:11.590> position

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
let's talk about the right hand position

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.240 
let's talk about the right hand position
we're<00:01:13.210> going<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.390> talk<00:01:13.540> about<00:01:13.690> floating<00:01:14.440> we're

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
we're going to talk about floating we're

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.280 
we're going to talk about floating we're
going<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.430> talk<00:01:15.580> about<00:01:15.729> posting<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:17.200> we're

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
going to talk about posting and we're

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.380 
going to talk about posting and we're
going<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.440> talk<00:01:17.590> about<00:01:17.710> gliding<00:01:18.370> let's<00:01:19.180> talk

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
going to talk about gliding let's talk

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.109 
going to talk about gliding let's talk
about<00:01:19.540> floating<00:01:19.990> first<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.550> advantage<00:01:21.970> to

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
about floating first the advantage to

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.000 
about floating first the advantage to
floating<00:01:22.540> if<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.229> opportunity<00:01:23.890> to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
floating if you have the opportunity to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.040 
floating if you have the opportunity to
have<00:01:24.130> consistent<00:01:24.880> attack<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.600> strings<00:01:25.900> as

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
have consistent attack on the strings as

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.080 
have consistent attack on the strings as
you<00:01:26.170> play<00:01:26.380> over<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.680> string<00:01:26.920> field<00:01:27.190> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
you play over the string field the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.390 
you play over the string field the
disadvantage<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.560> hand<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:29.860> floating<00:01:30.250> and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
disadvantage is the hand is floating and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.990 
disadvantage is the hand is floating and
so<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.270> less<00:01:31.600> balance<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.650> control

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so you have less balance and control

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.510 
so you have less balance and control
making<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.270> little<00:01:34.509> bit<00:01:34.600> more<00:01:34.750> difficult<00:01:35.520> let's

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
making a little bit more difficult let's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.790 
making a little bit more difficult let's
talk<00:01:36.729> about<00:01:36.880> posting<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:38.259> can<00:01:38.290> post<00:01:38.619> with

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
talk about posting you can post with

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.120 
talk about posting you can post with
your<00:01:38.860> fingers<00:01:39.340> ring<00:01:40.300> finger<00:01:40.690> or<00:01:41.050> pinky<00:01:41.289> or<00:01:42.039> you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
your fingers ring finger or pinky or you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.560 
your fingers ring finger or pinky or you
can<00:01:42.250> also<00:01:42.399> post<00:01:42.789> with<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.119> palm<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.479> hand

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
can also post with the palm of your hand

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.090 
can also post with the palm of your hand
on<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.830> pins<00:01:45.520> this<00:01:46.420> offers<00:01:46.899> an<00:01:47.110> advantage<00:01:47.920> of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
on the pins this offers an advantage of

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.370 
on the pins this offers an advantage of
a<00:01:48.430> lot<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.700> control<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:50.020> have<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> lot<00:01:50.350> of

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
a lot of control you have a lot of

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.160 
a lot of control you have a lot of
control<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:51.009> way<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.399> that<00:01:51.580> way<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:52.170> play

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
control this way and that way to play

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.040 
control this way and that way to play
basically<00:01:53.979> with<00:01:54.430> good<00:01:54.759> strength<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.810> only

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
basically with good strength the only

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.139 
basically with good strength the only
problem<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.190> have<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.520> stretch<00:01:57.850> out

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
problem is that you have to stretch out

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.870 
problem is that you have to stretch out
and<00:01:58.539> it's<00:01:59.110> going<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.289> diminish<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.310> accuracy

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and it's going to diminish the accuracy

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.150 
and it's going to diminish the accuracy
of<00:02:01.149> your<00:02:01.210> pressure<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.380> each<00:02:02.560> string<00:02:02.979> and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
of your pressure on each string and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.359 
of your pressure on each string and
change<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.940> slightly<00:02:04.420> same<00:02:05.410> here<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
change it slightly same here you have to

will<00:02:09.340> change<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.090> your<00:02:10.239> accuracy<00:02:10.660> is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
will change so your accuracy is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.890 
will change so your accuracy is
diminished<00:02:11.350> but<00:02:11.530> your<00:02:11.680> control<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.280> increased

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
diminished but your control is increased

I<00:03:11.709> would<00:03:11.890> use<00:03:12.160> maybe<00:03:12.400> for<00:03:12.700> something<00:03:12.910> harsher

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
I would use maybe for something harsher

I would use maybe for something harsher
or<00:03:14.170> something<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.739> would<00:03:14.890> be<00:03:15.040> more<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.910> an

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
or something that would be more of an

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.040 
or something that would be more of an
attack<00:03:16.890> possibly<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> blues<00:03:18.220> number<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.930> to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
get more volume and more attack I would

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.699 
get more volume and more attack I would
stay<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.330> here<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.170> you've<00:03:23.320> got<00:03:23.470> three

okay<00:03:31.350> let's<00:03:31.560> talk<00:03:31.650> about<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:32.070> natural<00:03:32.370> arc<00:03:32.880> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
okay let's talk about the natural arc of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.650 
okay let's talk about the natural arc of
the<00:03:33.120> hand<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.780> natural<00:03:34.140> arc<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.710> this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the hand the natural arc is to do this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.650 
the hand the natural arc is to do this
based<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.870> where<00:03:37.140> your<00:03:37.320> elbow<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:38.660> and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
based on where your elbow is and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.040 
based on where your elbow is and
adjacent<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> guitar<00:03:40.560> body<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.630> best<00:03:42.870> way

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
adjacent to the guitar body the best way

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.140 
adjacent to the guitar body the best way
to<00:03:43.080> do<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.740> to<00:03:43.980> get<00:03:44.100> an<00:03:44.250> even<00:03:44.580> tone<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
to do this is to get an even tone in the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.360 
to do this is to get an even tone in the
sweet<00:03:45.360> spot<00:03:45.480> by<00:03:46.350> strumming<00:03:46.800> through<00:03:47.130> your

all the way down in the sweet spot as we

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.420 
all the way down in the sweet spot as we
talked<00:03:54.720> about<00:03:54.840> earlier<00:03:55.020> if<00:03:55.830> you're<00:03:56.280> gonna

these last three strings instead of
sounds<00:04:07.620> very<00:04:07.830> harsh<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.790> would<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.680> would

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
sounds very harsh so I would I would

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.500 
sounds very harsh so I would I would
make<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.040> art<00:04:11.310> lighten<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.090> where<00:04:12.210> that<00:04:12.450> is

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
make that art lighten to where that is

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.290 
make that art lighten to where that is
very<00:04:13.050> ly<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:13.890> even<00:04:14.280> lighter<00:04:14.550> as<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.120> go

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
very ly and that's even lighter as I go

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.770 
very ly and that's even lighter as I go
this<00:04:15.510> way<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.549> you'd<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.269> strum

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
this way so if you'd like to strum

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.570 
this way so if you'd like to strum
through<00:04:19.109> you'll<00:04:19.350> get<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.650> even<00:04:19.859> sweet<00:04:20.280> tone

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
through you'll get that even sweet tone

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.180 
through you'll get that even sweet tone
and<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> sweet<00:04:22.200> spot<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.950> want<00:04:23.100> to

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and on the sweet spot and if you want to

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.400 
and on the sweet spot and if you want to
harm<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.730> need<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.940> lighten<00:04:24.270> up<00:04:24.510> as<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.050> bring

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
harm you need to lighten up as you bring

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.140 
harm you need to lighten up as you bring
the<00:04:25.620> strings<00:04:25.950> into<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> final<00:04:26.790> end<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the strings into the final end of the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.300 
the strings into the final end of the
straw

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.400 

let's<00:04:32.310> talk<00:04:32.490> about<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.850> pic<00:04:33.060> angle<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.290> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
let's talk about the pic angle and this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.570 
let's talk about the pic angle and this
involves<00:04:34.680> volume<00:04:35.280> speed<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.759> tone<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:38.280> front

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
involves volume speed and tone the front

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.330 
involves volume speed and tone the front
angle<00:04:39.350> which<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.560> way<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> prefer<00:04:40.949> to<00:04:41.220> hold

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
angle which is the way I prefer to hold

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.140 
angle which is the way I prefer to hold
it<00:04:42.470> gives<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.620> more<00:04:43.830> speed<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.729> melon<00:04:45.060> or

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
it gives you more speed in a melon or

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.939 
it gives you more speed in a melon or
tone<00:04:45.389> because<00:04:45.840> there's<00:04:46.020> less<00:04:46.289> surface<00:04:46.620> area

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
tone because there's less surface area

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.010 
tone because there's less surface area
of<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.250> pic<00:04:47.460> hitting<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:47.910> string<00:04:51.020> it's

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
of the pic hitting the string it's

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.860 
of the pic hitting the string it's
easier<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.500> push<00:04:52.710> through<00:04:53.389> same<00:04:54.389> thing<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.780> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
easier to push through same thing on the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.170 
easier to push through same thing on the
back<00:04:55.050> angle<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.710> lot<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:56.820> double-jointed

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
back angle a lot of double-jointed

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.420 
back angle a lot of double-jointed
guitar<00:04:57.720> players<00:04:57.960> use<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.620> back<00:04:58.830> angle<00:04:59.100> and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
guitar players use the back angle and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.800 
guitar players use the back angle and
it's<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.639> same<00:04:59.910> thing<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.389> get<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:00.690> the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
it's the same thing that I get on the

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.900 
it's the same thing that I get on the
front<00:05:00.990> angle<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:02.130> it's<00:05:02.250> only<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.729> back

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
front angle but it's only on the back

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.629 
front angle but it's only on the back
side<00:05:03.470> it's<00:05:04.470> easier<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.830> push<00:05:05.039> through<00:05:05.280> and

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
side it's easier to push through and

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.420 
side it's easier to push through and
gives<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.000> melon<00:05:06.330> or<00:05:06.419> tone<00:05:07.130> those<00:05:08.130> players

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
gives you a melon or tone those players

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.279 
gives you a melon or tone those players
that<00:05:08.550> hold<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.970> flat<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.510> string<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.050> get

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
that hold it flat on the string you get

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.879 
that hold it flat on the string you get
a<00:05:10.320> brighter<00:05:10.650> tone<00:05:12.350> but<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.470> have<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> lot<00:05:13.860> more

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
a brighter tone but you have a lot more

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.149 
a brighter tone but you have a lot more
drag<00:05:14.370> less<00:05:14.970> control

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.059 

let's<00:05:21.089> talk<00:05:21.239> about<00:05:21.360> pic<00:05:21.809> extension<00:05:22.619> or<00:05:22.770> the

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
let's talk about pic extension or the

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.070 
let's talk about pic extension or the
depth<00:05:23.339> that<00:05:24.119> you<00:05:24.300> play<00:05:24.509> with<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.749> strings

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
depth that you play with the strings

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.489 
depth that you play with the strings
with<00:05:25.589> your<00:05:25.709> pick<00:05:25.949> a<00:05:26.279> small<00:05:27.270> pick<00:05:27.899> extension

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.499 
with your pick a small pick extension

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.009 
with your pick a small pick extension
basically<00:05:29.369> gives<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.849> a<00:05:30.089> little<00:05:30.479> more<00:05:30.779> ease

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:31.019 
basically gives you a little more ease

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.949 
basically gives you a little more ease
of<00:05:31.259> control<00:05:31.649> a<00:05:31.919> less<00:05:32.729> volume<00:05:33.089> because<00:05:33.659> you<00:05:33.779> had

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:33.959 
of control a less volume because you had

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.459 
of control a less volume because you had
less<00:05:34.409> pick<00:05:34.739> to<00:05:35.099> push<00:05:35.309> through<00:05:35.569> if<00:05:36.569> you<00:05:37.229> play

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
less pick to push through if you play

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.850 
less pick to push through if you play
with<00:05:37.649> more<00:05:37.919> pic<00:05:38.309> medium<00:05:39.059> or<00:05:39.300> large<00:05:39.679> you<00:05:40.679> get

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
with more pic medium or large you get

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.929 
with more pic medium or large you get
more<00:05:41.129> volume<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:42.479> less<00:05:43.349> control<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.519> I<00:05:44.550> prefer

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
more volume and less control so I prefer

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.989 
more volume and less control so I prefer
to<00:05:45.149> use<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.539> medium<00:05:45.929> pick<00:05:46.529> extension<00:05:47.189> and<00:05:47.369> the

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:47.999 
to use a medium pick extension and the

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:55.740 
to use a medium pick extension and the
front<00:05:48.300> edge<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.779> the<00:05:48.869> pick

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.530 

pick<00:05:56.750> articulation<00:05:57.650> we<00:05:58.610> need<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:58.880> elbow<00:05:59.240> the

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
pick articulation we need the elbow the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.270 
pick articulation we need the elbow the
wrist<00:05:59.570> and<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.140> forefinger<00:06:00.530> all<00:06:00.950> to<00:06:01.190> be

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
wrist and the forefinger all to be

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.550 
wrist and the forefinger all to be
involved<00:06:01.400> in<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.270> provide<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.260> best

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
involved in this to provide the best

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.330 
involved in this to provide the best
balance<00:06:03.950> tone<00:06:04.910> and<00:06:05.270> control<00:06:05.920> I'm<00:06:06.920> gonna<00:06:07.100> play

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
balance tone and control I'm gonna play

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.340 
balance tone and control I'm gonna play
you<00:06:07.400> something<00:06:07.700> that<00:06:07.970> will<00:06:08.030> show<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.390> how<00:06:09.200> my

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
you something that will show you how my

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.350 
you something that will show you how my
right<00:06:09.560> hand<00:06:09.830> acts<00:06:10.160> as<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.580> play<00:06:10.820> and<00:06:11.120> then<00:06:11.240> I'll

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
right hand acts as I play and then I'll

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.960 
right hand acts as I play and then I'll
describe<00:06:11.630> it

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.630 

so<00:06:16.690> basically<00:06:17.080> I've<00:06:17.320> got<00:06:17.560> my<00:06:17.770> thumb<00:06:18.040> pushing

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
so basically I've got my thumb pushing

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.150 
so basically I've got my thumb pushing
here<00:06:19.090> on<00:06:19.720> this<00:06:20.080> knuckle<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:20.800> I'm<00:06:20.950> pushing

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
here on this knuckle and I'm pushing

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.580 
here on this knuckle and I'm pushing
down<00:06:21.370> as<00:06:21.910> my<00:06:22.180> first<00:06:22.450> finger<00:06:22.690> pulls<00:06:23.050> up<00:06:23.260> on<00:06:23.410> my

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
down as my first finger pulls up on my

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.350 
down as my first finger pulls up on my
upstrokes<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.400> these<00:06:24.580> two<00:06:24.850> things<00:06:25.180> are

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
upstrokes and these two things are
