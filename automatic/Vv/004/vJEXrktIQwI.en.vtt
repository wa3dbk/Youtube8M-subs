final that was at the crucible so yeah
in<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> very<00:00:20.279> proud<00:00:21.180> moment<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.600> me<00:00:21.689> probably

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
in a very proud moment for me probably

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.650 
in a very proud moment for me probably
the<00:00:22.109> proudest<00:00:22.880> not<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> best<00:00:24.150> achievement<00:00:24.600> in

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the proudest not the best achievement in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
the proudest not the best achievement in
my<00:00:24.750> career<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.320> still<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.740> winning<00:00:25.920> winning

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
my career I still think winning winning

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.970 
my career I still think winning winning
a<00:00:26.369> ranking<00:00:26.699> title<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.269> probably<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.740> better

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a ranking title is probably is better

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.410 
a ranking title is probably is better
than<00:00:29.160> getting<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> final<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> world

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
than getting to a final of the world

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870 
than getting to a final of the world
title<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:32.219> terms<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.700> being

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
title but I think in terms of being

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.670 
title but I think in terms of being
really<00:00:33.149> proud<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.290> proudest

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
really proud I think this is my proudest

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.370 
really proud I think this is my proudest
moment<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> was

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
moment you know because there I was

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.190 
moment you know because there I was
under<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> pressure<00:00:37.950> coming<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
under a lot of pressure coming in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
under a lot of pressure coming in
apparently<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.649> might<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.120> there<00:00:42.120> might<00:00:42.149> be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
apparently there might be there might be

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819

the cart before the horse here but you

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.200 
the cart before the horse here but you
know<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.430> think<00:03:08.610> about<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.090> an

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
know when you think about it it is an

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.820 
know when you think about it it is an
international<00:03:09.840> game<00:03:09.990> why<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.500> been<00:03:10.620> so

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
international game why is it been so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.110 
international game why is it been so
tough<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.520> for<00:03:11.700> players<00:03:11.940> from

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
tough to you think for players from

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.600 
tough to you think for players from
outside<00:03:12.660> these<00:03:13.140> shores<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.430> well

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
outside these shores really to do well

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.730 
outside these shores really to do well
yeah<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.750> could<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:16.170> little<00:03:16.320> bit<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> do

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
yeah it could have a little bit to do

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.560 
yeah it could have a little bit to do
with<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.890> support<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.490> think<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.820> think<00:03:18.000> um<00:03:18.270> I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
with the support I think I think um I

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.700 
with the support I think I think um I
don't<00:03:19.110> know<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.530> I'm

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
don't know if it's because I'm

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.170 
don't know if it's because I'm
Australian<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.370> everyone<00:03:20.640> wants<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.090> you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
Australian and everyone wants to see you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.000 
Australian and everyone wants to see you
not<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.420> get<00:03:21.540> beat

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
not to get beat

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.950 
not to get beat
it<00:03:23.010> seems<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.580> sometimes<00:03:24.270> I<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.780> lot<00:03:24.930> of

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
it seems that sometimes I have a lot of

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.950 
it seems that sometimes I have a lot of
support<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:25.770> sometimes<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.400> don't<00:03:26.460> and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
support but then sometimes I don't and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.700 
support but then sometimes I don't and
well<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:27.990> think<00:03:28.230> you're<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.410> more

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
well I think you're just more

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.680 
well I think you're just more
comfortable<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.370> know<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.520> think<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.630> know

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
comfortable you know I think you know

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.420 
comfortable you know I think you know
the<00:03:31.050> players<00:03:31.260> over<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.770> if<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.100> B<00:03:32.250> they

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the players over here if they get B they

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.770 
the players over here if they get B they
just<00:03:32.610> drive<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> couple<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.300> hours<00:03:33.450> down<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
just drive a couple of hours down the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.120 
just drive a couple of hours down the
road<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.080> their<00:03:34.140> home<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.560> know<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.710> me<00:03:34.980> I've

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
road in their home you know for me I've

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.830 
road in their home you know for me I've
got<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> book<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.700> flight<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.060> 24<00:03:36.540> hours<00:03:36.780> later

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
got a book of flight and 24 hours later

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.150 
got a book of flight and 24 hours later
you<00:03:37.230> know<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.380> mean<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> opposite<00:03:37.890> side<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
you know I mean the opposite side of the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.040 
you know I mean the opposite side of the
world<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.490> home<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.730> me<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.540> think

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
world and that's home to me so I think

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.390 
world and that's home to me so I think
just<00:03:40.380> from<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.680> aspect<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:41.190> really

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
just from that aspect it's really

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.730 
just from that aspect it's really
difficult<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.210> you<00:03:42.930> know<00:03:43.020> but<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.380> lot<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
difficult and you know but a lot of the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.780 
difficult and you know but a lot of the
Chinese<00:03:43.920> boys<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.460> everything<00:03:44.700> they're

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
Chinese boys and everything they're

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.160 
Chinese boys and everything they're
coming<00:03:45.060> through<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:45.750> think<00:03:45.930> it'll<00:03:46.050> be

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
coming through so I don't think it'll be

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.930 
coming through so I don't think it'll be
too<00:03:46.350> long<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.920> know<00:03:47.010> I'll<00:03:47.130> see<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.670> can't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
too long you know I'll see if I can't

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.160 
too long you know I'll see if I can't
win<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> final<00:03:48.480> didn't<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.840> don't<00:03:48.990> think<00:03:49.110> it'd

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
win the final didn't I don't think it'd

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.200 
win the final didn't I don't think it'd
be<00:03:49.200> too<00:03:49.260> long<00:03:49.500> before<00:03:49.620> somebody<00:03:50.040> does<00:03:50.210> we've

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
be too long before somebody does we've

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.910 
be too long before somebody does we've
talked<00:03:51.450> about<00:03:51.570> your<00:03:51.840> story<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.500> been<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> very

interesting story you gave up everything

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.570 
interesting story you gave up everything
as<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.960> teenager<00:03:55.440> decided<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.980> come<00:03:56.160> over<00:03:56.190> here

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
as a teenager decided to come over here

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.160 
as a teenager decided to come over here
and<00:03:56.640> give<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.030> go<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.330> snooker<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:58.080> were

think and then you had to go back and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.440 
think and then you had to go back and
then<00:04:01.710> you<00:04:01.950> decided<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.520> come<00:04:02.700> back<00:04:02.850> again<00:04:03.000> it's

then you decided to come back again it's
worked<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.200> but<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.740> whole<00:04:05.010> journey
