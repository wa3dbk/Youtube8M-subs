00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.129
 hi i am umberto oldani and i give you the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.480
 welcome in easy blender 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.430
 blender is open source software 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.930
 completely free with which then 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.780
 really create what you want 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.970
 the only obstacle is your imagination e 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.609
 multiplatform can install it on 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.519
 windows on apple mac os systems or 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.279
 on linux and in blender it's easy to find out 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.289
 how easy it is to learn to use it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.509
 if you decide to enroll you will learn a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.029
 create realistic landscapes using 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.099
 handy features and plugins that you can 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.860
 use to complete beautify yours 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.870
 images of architecture you will be amazed of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.100
 how it is possible to model objects 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.500
 also very complex 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.290
 starting from simple geometric shapes o 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 from curves by painting directly on the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.160
 model will get texture 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.040
 personalized and make real works 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.290
 art I will teach you to use simple 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.030
 animations to model objects ti 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.190
 I will show you how to set a light 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.640
 natural for your scene and create 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.890
 realistic materials I will finally take you to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 discover the compositing of a blender 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.489
 image correction technique 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920
 obtained with little rendering 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.950
 known but if used properly can give 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.509
 extremely interesting results 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 I want at this point to let me touch with 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.860
 all this here is a preview of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 what you can get with blender 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 I insert a base curve and that I rotate by 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 90 degrees both on the hicks axis and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 on the y axis and changes the mode of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.039
 display inedit mode in the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 transform window deselect the 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.539
 normal box and new vertices of the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 curve trying to follow the most 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.220
 faithfully possible the shape of the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.530
 reference teapot inserting others 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.530
 vertices using the dabliu command 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.610
 when the curve is finished, it changes 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 the display mode in object 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.950
 fashions and before making any 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.780
 edit copy the curve with shift of e 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.250
 I put the copy on a new layer 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 using the m key 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.590
 so as to always have available 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.160
 the original return to the first layer e 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.470
 I select the curve I press the alt keys 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840
 I choose from the menu that appears the mesh entry 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.970
 from card how you can notice 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.830
 changing the mode again 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.640
 display inedit mode or 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.829
 transformed the curve into a mesh to avoid 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.019
 a final mesh too complex this is 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.540
 equipped with too many vertices or elimination 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.920
 some gathering those remaining through 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.720
 the command f 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.489
 so as to obtain a cleaner profile 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.200
 fits right here your email address and 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 you will immediately receive the tutorial 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.700
 complete and free 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.530
 wishing us a good stay 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.579
 in easy blender I give you a warm one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.579
 greeting hello
