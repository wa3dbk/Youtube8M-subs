00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
bubbles and I don't have quite as tight

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:12.930 
bubbles and I don't have quite as tight
of<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.790> seal<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.150> I<00:01:55.270> should<00:01:55.450> there<00:01:55.690> we<00:01:55.780> go

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.930 

and<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.910> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.900 

but<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:27.040> would<00:02:27.160> work<00:02:27.250> better<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.849> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
but it would work better if I in a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:39.040 
but it would work better if I in a
better<00:02:28.060> seal<00:02:29.370> there<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.489> go

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.470 

in<00:02:39.140> retrospect<00:02:39.980> put<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> towel<00:02:40.820> down<00:02:40.850> when<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
in retrospect put a towel down when you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.540 
in retrospect put a towel down when you
do<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.810> I've<00:02:42.110> made<00:02:42.470> quite<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.770> bit<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.370> mess

on my table and I'm out of carbon

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.100 
on my table and I'm out of carbon
dioxide<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.890> it's<00:02:49.700> fun<00:02:49.970> while<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.240> lasts<00:02:50.750> it's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
