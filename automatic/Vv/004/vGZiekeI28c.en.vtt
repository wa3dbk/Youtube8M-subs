00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:13.720 

you

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:44.050 

let's<00:03:14.730> crank<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.180> little<00:03:15.329> bit<00:03:15.450> more

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:04:09.120 

supernatural

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.070 

kinda<00:04:10.130> has<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.280> little<00:04:10.580> bit<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:11.080> modulated

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
kinda has a little bit of a modulated

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:27.429 
kinda has a little bit of a modulated
swirl<00:04:12.410> going<00:04:12.860> on

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:05:01.500 

and<00:04:28.439> the<00:04:28.560> wet<00:04:28.770> reverb

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.430 

so<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:04.990> supernatural<00:05:05.990> has<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.200> lot<00:05:06.410> more

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
so the supernatural has a lot more

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
doesn't have that much that many sounds

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.060 
doesn't have that much that many sounds
it<00:05:13.760> just<00:05:13.970> kind<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.270> has<00:05:14.420> one<00:05:14.690> sound<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.350> does
