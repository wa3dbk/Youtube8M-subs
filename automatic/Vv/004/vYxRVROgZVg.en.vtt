to<00:00:26.849> build<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.180> snow<00:00:27.390> golem<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.920> let's<00:00:28.920> get

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to build your snow golem with let's get

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
to build your snow golem with let's get
started<00:00:29.660> first<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.199> want<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> place

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
started first of all you want to place

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
started first of all you want to place
your<00:00:32.700> building<00:00:33.120> blocks<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> shape<00:00:34.140> like

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
your building blocks in a shape like

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.330 
your building blocks in a shape like
this<00:00:34.520> make<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.550> too<00:00:35.940> high<00:00:36.950> then<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this make it too high then you want to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
this make it too high then you want to
dig<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> block<00:00:39.090> down<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.840> bottom<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dig out the block down at the bottom and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280 
dig out the block down at the bottom and
the<00:00:40.500> block<00:00:40.710> directly<00:00:41.219> across<00:00:41.399> from<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the block directly across from it it's a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.560 
the block directly across from it it's a
chicken<00:00:45.440> go<00:00:46.440> away<00:00:46.530> chicken<00:00:50.059> no<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> said<00:00:51.390> go

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
chicken go away chicken no I said go

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
chicken go away chicken no I said go
away<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.789> piston

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
away well first then you put your piston

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.840 
away well first then you put your piston
across<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:56.420> dumb<00:00:57.420> chicken

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
across from it right here dumb chicken

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.069 
across from it right here dumb chicken
so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> piston<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so you have a piston right there and I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.810 
so you have a piston right there and I
know<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.710> wire<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
know you just want to wire it up now you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
know you just want to wire it up now you
can<00:01:09.330> build<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.689> snow<00:01:09.960> gall<00:01:11.659> just<00:01:12.659> place<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
can build your snow gall just place to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.880 
can build your snow gall just place to
snow<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> pumpkin<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.340> top<00:01:15.409> now<00:01:16.409> push

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
snow with the pumpkin on top now push

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
snow with the pumpkin on top now push
this<00:01:17.100> over<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.020> he's<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.350> this

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this over here and see now he's on this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
this over here and see now he's on this
block<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:19.979> break<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> snow<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> comes

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
block if you break the snow it comes

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.789 
block if you break the snow it comes
back<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> keep<00:01:23.220> mining<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.210> eventually

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
back and keep mining here but eventually

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
back and keep mining here but eventually
you're<00:01:25.799> probably<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> mine<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you're probably going to mine out that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.859 
you're probably going to mine out that
block<00:01:27.509> underneath<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.350> or<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.540> if

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
block underneath there or if you are if

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
block underneath there or if you are if
you<00:01:31.020> might<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:33.000> prevent<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you might and to prevent that you can

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.590 
you might and to prevent that you can
put<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.939> solid<00:01:35.939> block<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:37.310> stronger<00:01:38.310> one

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
put a solid block there a stronger one

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.550 
put a solid block there a stronger one
you<00:01:39.600> won't<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.840> able<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> mind<00:01:40.229> through<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you won't be able to mind through with a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.649 
you won't be able to mind through with a
shovel<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:41.040> quickly<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.390> obsidian<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
shovel very quickly or like obsidian and

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.969 
shovel very quickly or like obsidian and
you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.960> harvest<00:01:46.380> away<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> shovel

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you can just harvest away with a shovel

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.969 
you can just harvest away with a shovel
and<00:01:47.340> lots<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.880> snow<00:01:48.439> there<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> trick<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and lots of snow there is a trick to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
and lots of snow there is a trick to
this<00:01:50.220> though<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.060> spam<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.509> mouse<00:01:51.689> clicks<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this though you spam your mouse clicks a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
this though you spam your mouse clicks a
couple<00:01:52.409> times<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.009> start<00:01:53.250> holding<00:01:53.460> them

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
couple times and then start holding them

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.980 
couple times and then start holding them
look<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:54.780> fast<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.170> gaining<00:01:55.470> snow<00:01:56.990> that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
look how fast I'm gaining snow that's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
look how fast I'm gaining snow that's
pretty<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> quickest<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.130> possible<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
pretty much the quickest way possible to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.990 
pretty much the quickest way possible to
collect<00:01:59.969> gain<00:02:00.329> snow<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> game<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.000> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
collect gain snow in the game and this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450 
collect gain snow in the game and this

and<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:14.269> requires<00:02:14.719> you<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.049> be<00:02:15.079> in<00:02:15.260> a
