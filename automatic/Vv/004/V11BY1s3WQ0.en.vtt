and<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> caddies<00:01:58.110> hit<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> ball<00:01:58.950> many

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and when the caddies hit the ball many

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
and when the caddies hit the ball many
times<00:01:59.729> putting<00:02:00.540> dents<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.140> cracks<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
times putting dents and cracks and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
times putting dents and cracks and
everything<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> them<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.820> players<00:02:03.060> noticed

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
everything in them the players noticed

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.730 
everything in them the players noticed
that<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> caddies<00:02:04.170> were<00:02:04.320> getting<00:02:04.619> better

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that the caddies were getting better

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.570 
that the caddies were getting better
distance<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.820> better<00:02:06.119> control<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.990> ball

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
distance and better control of the ball

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.949 
distance and better control of the ball
so<00:02:08.580> someone<00:02:08.910> decided<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.450> must<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
so someone decided what must be the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.170 
so someone decided what must be the
Knicks<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> while<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Knicks in it so for a while I just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.100 
Knicks in it so for a while I just
beatniks

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
beatniks

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.720 
beatniks
into<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.160> developed<00:02:14.640> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
into it and then they developed a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.940 
into it and then they developed a
pattern<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.390> nicks<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.170> him<00:02:16.440> basically

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
pattern of nicks so him basically

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
pattern of nicks so him basically
literally<00:02:17.610> hammered<00:02:18.000> patterns<00:02:18.390> into<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
literally hammered patterns into the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.790 
literally hammered patterns into the
ball<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.140> give<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.620> aerodynamic

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
ball to give it more aerodynamic

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.340 
ball to give it more aerodynamic
properties<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.570> it's<00:02:21.960> called<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
properties that's right it's called a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.070 
properties that's right it's called a
hand<00:02:22.620> hammered<00:02:23.190> Guddi<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.570> did<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.780> with

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
hand hammered Guddi and they did it with

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.180 
hand hammered Guddi and they did it with
the<00:02:25.260> reverse<00:02:25.650> end<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.970> hammer<00:02:27.240> with<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
the reverse end of of a hammer with the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.600 
the reverse end of of a hammer with the
heat<00:02:29.190> n<00:02:29.460> donna<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.570> saw<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.770> basically<00:02:32.340> was

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
heat n donna and saw and basically was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.250 
heat n donna and saw and basically was
observation<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> Caddy's<00:02:33.990> playing

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
observation that the Caddy's playing

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.930 
observation that the Caddy's playing
with<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> old<00:02:34.620> beat-up<00:02:34.890> balls<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.640> their

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
with the old beat-up balls for their

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930 
with the old beat-up balls for their
boss<00:02:36.150> Ricardo<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.200> her<00:02:37.350> head<00:02:37.500> under<00:02:37.940> well

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
boss Ricardo got her head under well

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140 
boss Ricardo got her head under well
that<00:02:39.120> led<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.600> an<00:02:40.590> innovation<00:02:41.430> over<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:42.000> with

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that led to an innovation over here with

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.480 
that led to an innovation over here with
this<00:02:42.330> next<00:02:42.690> ball<00:02:43.110> i<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.560> tell<00:02:43.860> me<00:02:43.950> about<00:02:44.040> this

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
this next ball i have tell me about this

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.630 
this next ball i have tell me about this
that<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.240> what<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.660> call<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> rubber<00:02:46.170> ball

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
that is what they call a rubber ball

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.970 
that is what they call a rubber ball
they<00:02:47.640> found<00:02:48.209> out<00:02:48.390> how<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.020> make<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.440> rubber<00:02:49.770> ball

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
they found out how to make a rubber ball

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.280 
they found out how to make a rubber ball
and<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.760> turn<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> center<00:02:51.510> 1898

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and the turn of the center 1898

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.920 
and the turn of the center 1898
something<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.480> winding<00:02:54.480> around<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
something like that winding around the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.870 
something like that winding around the
core<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> kind<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> forerunner

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
core this is the kind of the forerunner

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880 
core this is the kind of the forerunner
of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> modern<00:02:57.300> ball<00:02:57.720> yes<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
of the modern ball yes it is with the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.310 
of the modern ball yes it is with the
concept<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> wound<00:03:00.030> ball<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.840> right<00:03:01.020> there

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
concept of the wound ball is right there

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.970 
concept of the wound ball is right there
but<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.910> used<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.330> gutta-percha<00:03:03.890> for<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
but they used the gutta-percha for the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920 
but they used the gutta-percha for the
cover<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.880> gutta<00:03:06.090> percha<00:03:06.180> cover<00:03:06.750> oh

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
cover so it's a gutta percha cover oh

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.630 
cover so it's a gutta percha cover oh
this<00:03:07.290> predates<00:03:08.239> alotta<00:03:09.260> alright<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
this predates alotta alright so it was a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.199 
this predates alotta alright so it was a
rubber<00:03:12.120> core<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> gutta<00:03:13.950> percha<00:03:14.209> cover

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
rubber core with a gutta percha cover

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.870 
rubber core with a gutta percha cover
and<00:03:15.540> again<00:03:16.130> convex<00:03:17.209> dimples<00:03:18.209> yes<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.410> ball

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and again convex dimples yes on the ball

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.050 
and again convex dimples yes on the ball
when<00:03:20.880> did<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.049> concave<00:03:22.500> dimples<00:03:23.070> if

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
when did we go to the concave dimples if

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.110 
when did we go to the concave dimples if
probably<00:03:24.510> around<00:03:25.040> 1909<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.519> think<00:03:26.820> I'm<00:03:26.940> not

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
probably around 1909 I think I'm not

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.330 
probably around 1909 I think I'm not
Taylor<00:03:27.660> Taylor<00:03:28.019> dimples<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:28.860> called<00:03:29.190> him

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
Taylor Taylor dimples they called him

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.080 
Taylor Taylor dimples they called him
and<00:03:29.780> spaulding<00:03:30.780> came<00:03:31.019> out<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.590> first

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and spaulding came out with the first

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.660 
and spaulding came out with the first
dimple<00:03:33.090> balls<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:34.170> right<00:03:34.830> around<00:03:34.980> 19<00:03:35.519> 09

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
dimple balls in right around 19 09

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.789 
dimple balls in right around 19 09
that's<00:03:36.390> an<00:03:36.510> interesting<00:03:36.630> story<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.410> really

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
that's an interesting story this really

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.160 
that's an interesting story this really
