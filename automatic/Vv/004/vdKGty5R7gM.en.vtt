 holiday answer begins alteration of the living room 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.199
 in the country house of their kings family 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.480
 the furniture is already rendered after her 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.480
 disassemble and take out the old staircase 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 finishing the ceiling and wall and floor 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:53.239
 dismantling the floor structure 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.239
 we strengthen with new lags 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.630
 Now let's do the warming layer style 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:12.520
 protective membrane as insulation 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 use lightweight stone wool slabs 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 100 millimeters thick and small 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.310
 excel format which significantly reduces 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 installation time 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 top layer of vapor permeable membrane 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.960
 additional floor insulation 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.980
 will give the bases from moisture resistant 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 chipboard thanks to 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.280
 tongued joints they are joined 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 fast and easy 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.920
 go to the finish floor 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.350
 roll out the substrate on top 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 we lay engineering floorboard with 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.789
 top layer of solid oak 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 spoons are interconnected 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.000
 mechanical locks 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.450
 besides
