00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
I really do I think she has one of the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.020 
I really do I think she has one of the
best<00:02:49.720> shapes<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.800> business<00:02:51.010> had<00:02:51.670> she<00:02:52.000> been

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
best shapes in the business had she been

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
best shapes in the business had she been
a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:53.140> tighter<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:54.430> lineup<00:02:54.880> could<00:02:55.060> have

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
a little tighter this lineup could have

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.420 
a little tighter this lineup could have
been<00:02:55.270> completely<00:02:55.750> different<00:02:56.350> okay<00:02:56.950> now<00:02:57.070> Kathy

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
been completely different okay now Kathy

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.190 
been completely different okay now Kathy
lefrancois<00:02:57.970> brought<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.750> much<00:02:58.959> better

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
lefrancois brought it much better

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.020 
lefrancois brought it much better
stronger<00:02:59.530> than<00:02:59.800> she<00:02:59.860> did<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.160> Olympia<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.820> I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
stronger than she did in Olympia and I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.390 
stronger than she did in Olympia and I
think<00:03:01.240> that's<00:03:01.390> why<00:03:01.540> she<00:03:01.810> got<00:03:01.990> six<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.310> know

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
think that's why she got six but I know

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.860 
think that's why she got six but I know
you<00:03:03.580> think<00:03:03.940> there's<00:03:04.180> someone<00:03:04.450> who<00:03:04.660> should

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
you think there's someone who should

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.660 
you think there's someone who should
have<00:03:04.930> finished<00:03:05.110> higher<00:03:05.500> well<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.250> just<00:03:06.280> thought

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
have finished higher well I just thought

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.650 
have finished higher well I just thought
that<00:03:07.380> overall<00:03:08.490> Kathy<00:03:09.490> looked<00:03:09.700> good<00:03:09.940> she<00:03:10.270> was

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
that overall Kathy looked good she was

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.100 
that overall Kathy looked good she was
sharp<00:03:11.050> she<00:03:12.010> probably<00:03:12.250> be<00:03:12.700> Tina<00:03:13.030> Chandler<00:03:13.989> and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
sharp she probably be Tina Chandler and

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.330 
sharp she probably be Tina Chandler and
that's<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> person<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.769> were<00:03:14.860> talking<00:03:15.190> about

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
that's the person we were talking about

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.670 
that's the person we were talking about
from<00:03:16.239> when<00:03:16.660> they<00:03:16.780> turned<00:03:17.019> around<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.560> you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
from when they turned around like you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.140 
from when they turned around like you
say<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.980> show<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.310> one<00:03:18.550> from<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.970> back

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
say the show is one from the back

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.479 
say the show is one from the back
Bettina<00:03:19.720> was<00:03:19.900> obviously<00:03:20.440> bigger<00:03:20.739> from<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
Bettina was obviously bigger from the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.000 
Bettina was obviously bigger from the
