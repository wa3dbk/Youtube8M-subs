00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.530
 Hi, I'm Mariana Ferrari and you're watching 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.260
 how to change life dotcom the place 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.539
 where you should be if you want to design you 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.730
 a life in which you feel happy 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.980
 participate and today's topic comes to root 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.189
 from a level that Juan Manuel wrote me 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.019
 and he asks me how do I get 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.259
 that those who work in this profession 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.170
 be more capable, more receptive and more 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.850
 bold and it's interesting because the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.699
 profession to which john refers 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.379
 manuel is advertising that just one 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.469
 of the areas of the professions where 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.960
 more talent is in the world I am 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.780
 it made me reflect on human beings 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.059
 we need a large quota of certainty and 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.980
 security we need to be calm and 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.230
 feel safe that the areas 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.870
 important in our life as love 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.390
 Health or finances are low 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.399
 control and especially that the world that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.160
 he turns us around he rotates like us 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.729
 we think you should turn every day 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.890
 I speak maybe with approximately 20 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.619
 people some in my sessions 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.210
 coaching others in work meetings 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.060
 another 20 people with whom 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.640
 to interact in a day 18 believe that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.860
 when something goes out of your control it 's 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.440
 due to some screw-up of the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.450
 person that they have closer or because 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.729
 simply life conspires against 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.250
 them when you blame another 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.020
 person of your lack of results or 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.180
 unfortunate circumstances of life 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.909
 that you have had to live that you can 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.710
 be like this but it's usually because 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.840
 you need to cover some of the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.940
 basic needs of the human being that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.399
 where you are looking to cover the certainty 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.050
 of the significance that speak of your 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.539
 need to feel stability 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.729
 security or to feel special or the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.190
 need to feel loved connected 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.110
 with the other person now how do you 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.780
 to know what the need is 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.240
 you're looking to cover very easy when 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.130
 things are beyond your control if you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.830
 you need to find certainty or 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.519
 significance in a situation will tend to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.380
 feel angry, frustrated or angry when 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.450
 instead what you're looking for is 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 feel connection and love and things are 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.670
 escape your control you will feel sad 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.450
 depressed or depressed in those cases in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.120
 what 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.650
 is the control ask yourself what thought 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.069
 I'm having that makes me feel 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.440
 insecure or unloved if you can understand 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.110
 why are you getting angry frustrating 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.180
 between being depressed can you 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.489
 take responsibility for the situation and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.400
 Take back the control you need 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.170
 while others are to blame you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 put in a place of inability to 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.849
 change the results when instead 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.799
 you realize what it is that is 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.959
 making you feel bad what is the real 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.730
 reason behind you can act on 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.519
 consequence and make the results 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.549
 specifically change life in the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.540
 company can sometimes result 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 frustrating because not everyone 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.790
 has the same objectives and purposes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.280
 why to work for example someone 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 can work to be the best the most 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.110
 recognized while your partner can 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.120
 that works to pay your bills and everything 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.769
 what interests you is the place to which 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.900
