00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
using this weapons weapon it's almost

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.090 
using this weapons weapon it's almost
better<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.640> aim<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.180> chest<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.860> torso

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
better just aim for the chest to torso

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
better just aim for the chest to torso
region<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.080> enemy

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
region and you can put down an enemy

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
region and you can put down an enemy
just<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.100> quick<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.370> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.520> by

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just about as quick as you can by

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
just about as quick as you can by
shooting<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> head<00:01:24.979> now<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.579> is<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
shooting them in the head now this is a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
shooting them in the head now this is a
huge<00:01:27.090> advantage<00:01:27.180> compared<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> other<00:01:27.990> weapons

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
huge advantage compared to other weapons

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
huge advantage compared to other weapons
because<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.770> weapons<00:01:29.189> usually<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because other weapons usually take a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
because other weapons usually take a
couple<00:01:30.479> less<00:01:30.810> shots<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> hit<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
couple less shots if you hit them in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
couple less shots if you hit them in the
head<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.969> they<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> higher<00:01:33.479> rate<00:01:33.810> or

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
head because they have a higher rate or

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.100 
head because they have a higher rate or
a<00:01:34.079> higher<00:01:34.439> damage<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.479> call<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.719> duty<00:01:36.960> on
