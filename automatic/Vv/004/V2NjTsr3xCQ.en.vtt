00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
to do something different because I've

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360 
to do something different because I've
had<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> subscription<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.769> quite<00:00:14.130> some<00:00:14.340> time

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
about it I don't know why but um it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.400

if you're not familiar with birchbox it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.140 
if you're not familiar with birchbox it
is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> subscription<00:00:25.170> box<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> box

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is a subscription box that you get a box
