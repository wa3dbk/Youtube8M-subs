00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:12.200
 [Music Introduction] 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.020
 [Background Music] 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.660
 A clear sky one evening, away from the city lights, filled with more stars than 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 We can dream of counting them, right? 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 If there is a certain amount of sand grains per star we can see them with the naked eye 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.580
 The total will be only 9.096 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.160
 Each star radiates enough to see from Earth without the aid of a telescope, one of which is the star of the scorpion's heart 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 According to the astronomical scale of brightness, the sun appears at the level of 27 - and the full moon at the level of 13 - 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.450
 Even in the worst places on earth such as the Atacama Desert in Chile 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.820
 Our naked eyes can recognize only objects that have a brightness of 6.5 or greater. 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.900
 But what about having bigger eyes? We can see much more. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.020
 [Music] 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.050
 This Andromeda galaxy (the serial women) is the largest galaxy close to the Milky Way galaxy, 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.360
 It is full of stars. 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:32.390
 [Music] 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.250
 The earth is surrounded by an area of ​​360 degrees from all sides. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.380
 For example, take a bracket of one degree and divide it into 60 parts. This is called a arc / minute. 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.170
 This is a 1.5-billion-pixel image of the Hubble Space Telescope, covering about 1,000 arc / square meters 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.119
 And contains more than 100 million stars. 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.039
 Let's think logically: if the Andromeda galaxy is brighter 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.450
 It will look like this next to our moon. 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.380
 But we do not need to look for a large space in the sky to find 100 million stars. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.680
 Let us look close to this little piece of the sky. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.790
 A Hubble telescope was directed at this piece of the sky and its shutter was opened for two million seconds 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.840
 From a similar empty angle in space thousands of galaxies have emerged, not stars. 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.040
 Some were 13.2 years old 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.760
 They are photons emitted from the very beginning of the universe. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.400
 The darkest shot in this picture is darker 10 billion times 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.760
 Which we can see with our own eyes. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.420
 And to cover the whole sky 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.700
 You will need 30 million square meters of the Deep Deep Hubble field. 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.510
 Scientists estimated that the observed universe contains 200 billion galaxies. If, instead of stars, 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.050
 We estimated each galaxy with a grain of sand, those grains would fill 27 cubic meters. 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.360
 So how many stars are there? Maybe one spatillion, that's a very big figure 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.280
 It does not seem logical. But we are sure of one thing 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 That there are not enough beaches on the ground to accommodate all of them. 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 Carl Sagan had said: "Earth is the coast of the cosmic ocean ..." if you remember 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.560
 Every night we look at a sky full of stars 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.520
 We move one of our fingers in the sand. 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
 Stay curious.
