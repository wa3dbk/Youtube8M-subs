00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 at 

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.190
 come 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.160
 hi the glitchs hours the one who has 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.890
 so today we find ourselves 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.790
 for a new compilation so on 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.479
 the map drive so zombie mode so 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.580
 this compilation will actually consist of 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.350
 go to zombies spain with 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.750
 so the propeller so as you see 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.769
 in the video in fact i'm going so you 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.680
 go see that I'm going to go in 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.190
 several zombie areas so that's 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.510
 really church had not hurt the only 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.030
 disadvantage is that in some 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.600
 aspects it will always have to jump for 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.310
 past lease says barriers we know the only 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.399
 disadvantage of glitch otherwise glitch 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 in itself is quite epic and to his 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.880
 fans to do so really I you 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.560
 shows I really do not explain 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.060
 how to do it is useless because you 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.549
 have in my opinion already how to do with 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.189
 the thruster so really you have not 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.859
 actually do the technique with the 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.420
 thruster for me a mp by skype or 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.840
 not a private message youtube or in the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.359
 comments 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 and you tell me with kylie I got you 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:41.799
 dreamed not so I will explain to you 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.469
 just the manipulation so you 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.819
 as you saw there are about 11 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.859
 for us zombies that I see there the 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.939
 case hello 12 so I know more 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.130
 really well done so commenting 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.490
 the video for can pass or can 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.619
 go through the barriers so here's the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.119
 places where there is no barrier ben 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.159
 you see that I do not jump to places 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.340
 where there are actually so I jumped all 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.959
 so just in this video there is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.580
 will have zombie spots that are 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.950
 exclusives that you do not have yet 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.980
 seen on youtube 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.980
 and others who are not eskimos 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.390
 so you will see that there are some 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.080
 still really coming out really 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.200
 not bad to do so thank you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 all those who helped me realize so 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 it's spawn so I want to 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.739
 thank 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 so I'm going to send is also said to 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.430
 great every winter so hoping 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 that they appreciate the premium I tell them 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 thank you 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.959
 so that's so low after there's not much 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.790
 things to do 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.620
 so here you are in death full of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.340
 zombies and then it's pretty fun to do 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.430
 so I wanted to thank you because 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.980
 I reached 2500 subscribers so 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.349
 really is slowly approaching 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.450
 3000 so that makes me very much 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.329
 pleasure 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.790
 so as you've seen it's always 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.970
 the same technique so you put a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.620
 propeller in a corner and so you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.630
 jump or sometimes you just stay 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.389
 in the stuff so here on the other hand 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.579
 pay attention to SICAVs in 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.370
 however do cravings of times do not 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.959
 are not necessarily attracted to you but 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.450
 if you go ahead or whatever 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.030
 either it touches you so I also held 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.910
 to tell you that now I'm doing 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.560
 so part of the army gritching so 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.870
 here I am part of the biggest 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.549
 French time gliding team so 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.859
 Thank you to this art of teasing 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.480
 have recruited me so the chain of 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.930
 the grichting army will be in descriptions 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.359
 I really advise them to go 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.120
 a trick is really to follow us and 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.859
 to subscribe of course if you go 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.609
 see that really is suit of 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:06.209
 French wilshere so go to you 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.090
 subscribe and do not hesitate go throw 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.230
 a look at all the chains of 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.870
 gleacher who then boxing so that's it 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.289
 so I'm not going much else to 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.359
 tell you if this is his so here is so 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.720
 there I vs me a little explain to you so 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.000
 the glitchs so 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.440
 right now as I saw I always 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.450
 I also made you a compilation of 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.120
 up the boxes except the other day 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.610
 it was not a zombie spy and 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.130
 as there are many I prefer in 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.420
 did you want to do a compilation and 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.620
 why Spain too and I preferred 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.040
 wanted to make a compilation 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.860
 simply because of Spain times 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.960
 or down it lasts a little 20 seconds I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.150
 am in and after so I take myself 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.590
 nor of barrier so I will not you 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.760
 put 20 seconds of video on the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.730
 chain 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.280
 it will serve in fact nothing so I 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.790
 prefers to do it in compilation 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.260
 quite simply 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.010
 so you saw there a friend of mine 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.370
 come to die directly so that's it 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.650
 so it's really glitching you 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.680
 do it and enjoy it before they 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.730
 are not affected in career I'm going 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.160
 quickly the papers I think so that's it 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.740
 so for now compilations 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.190

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.460
