00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
semitone up the gene then a whole tone

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.310 
semitone up the gene then a whole tone
up<00:01:15.159> again<00:01:15.430> may<00:01:15.670> then<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:16.630> whole<00:01:16.780> turn<00:01:17.049> up<00:01:17.170> again

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
whole tone out for D and tone up again
to<00:01:24.880> go<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.210> e<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.540> what<00:01:26.409> we're<00:01:26.530> trying<00:01:26.650> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
to go to e so what we're trying to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.980 
to go to e so what we're trying to
achieve<00:01:26.890> here<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.670> trying<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.540> get<00:01:28.690> three

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
achieve here is trying to get three

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.060 
achieve here is trying to get three
notes<00:01:30.210> per<00:01:31.210> string<00:01:31.240> I'm<00:01:31.870> using<00:01:32.409> our<00:01:32.650> fingers

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
notes per string I'm using our fingers

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.690 
notes per string I'm using our fingers
so<00:01:33.640> obviously<00:01:34.300> we've<00:01:34.570> been<00:01:34.720> open<00:01:35.409> string<00:01:35.920> so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
so obviously we've been open string so

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.620 
so obviously we've been open string so
we'll<00:01:36.850> play<00:01:37.030> an<00:01:37.180> F<00:01:37.330> sharp<00:01:37.570> G<00:01:38.220> LA<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:40.240> my<00:01:40.390> first

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
we'll play an F sharp G LA with my first

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.880 
we'll play an F sharp G LA with my first
second<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.140> fourth<00:01:41.380> fingers<00:01:43.380> using<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.680> up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
second and fourth fingers using it up

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.060 
second and fourth fingers using it up
down<00:01:45.250> up<00:01:45.580> down<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.420> picking<00:01:47.320> progression

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
down up down and picking progression

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.950 
down up down and picking progression
this<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:48.610> known<00:01:48.820> as<00:01:48.850> alternate<00:01:49.540> picking<00:01:51.960> let

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
this is known as alternate picking let

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.020 
this is known as alternate picking let
me<00:01:53.049> get<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.490> next<00:01:54.700> night<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:54.850> need

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
me get to the a the next night we need

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.539 
me get to the a the next night we need
is<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> B<00:01:55.450> which<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:55.960> be<00:01:56.049> found<00:01:56.170> here<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.159> a

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
is a B which can be found here on the a

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.719 
is a B which can be found here on the a
string<00:01:57.729> at<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.270> second<00:01:58.659> fret<00:01:59.490> then<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.610> next

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
string at the second fret then the next

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.740 
string at the second fret then the next
note<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.299> semi<00:02:01.840> tone<00:02:02.080> up<00:02:02.290> which<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.770> same

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
note is semi tone up which is the same

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.920 
note is semi tone up which is the same
then<00:02:04.170> turn<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.590> again<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.250> day<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> altogether

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
then turn up again the day so altogether

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.410 
then turn up again the day so altogether
we<00:02:07.230> have

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.630 

also<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:11.380> get<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> D<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.980> need<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.250> go<00:02:12.400> up

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
also you get to the D we need to go up

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.050 
also you get to the D we need to go up
to<00:02:13.240> an<00:02:13.480> e<00:02:13.720> again<00:02:14.050> which<00:02:14.709> would<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.130> another

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
to an e again which would be another

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.430 
to an e again which would be another
wall<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:17.130> which<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.489> on<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.319> second<00:02:20.319> fret

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.640 
wall to which is here on the second fret
of<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.739> D<00:02:20.830> string<00:02:21.060> after<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:23.080> have<00:02:23.170> F<00:02:23.410> sharp

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
of the D string after we have F sharp

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.300 
of the D string after we have F sharp
which<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.459> toner<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.709> g<00:02:26.980> which<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
which is a toner and g which is a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.200 
which is a toner and g which is a
semitone<00:02:27.760> up

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.760 

hmm<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.140> have

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.180 

to<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> gene<00:02:36.700> after<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.840> G<00:02:37.990> we<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.380> an<00:02:38.500> A<00:02:38.620> which

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
to a gene after the G we have an A which

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.790 
to a gene after the G we have an A which
can<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.460> found<00:02:39.580> here<00:02:39.820> on<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.090> second<00:02:40.450> fret<00:02:40.800> g

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.570 
can be found here on the second fret g
string<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:43.000> it'd<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.440> tied<00:02:44.680> up<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.310> see

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580
