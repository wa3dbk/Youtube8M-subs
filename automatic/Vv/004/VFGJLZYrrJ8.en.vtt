00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.350
 very good girls are very good guys 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.650
 and discreet and we are in a new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.380
 news of money coming from poinsettia 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.370
 to spend it with the family and I find myself 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 how good 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 says squat as he attacks again and as 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.519
 they promised although that has not been 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.529
 fulminado xbox live remember that this 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.919
 group hacker was threatening for 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.589
 enough days with pulling xbox live by 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.140
 Christmas and pulling forever not 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.460
 remember this threat and so they have 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 done does not say the squad has 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 got to pull the down to the service already 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.769
 you will say to me tight but good they have stopped 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 to three or four people or is it supposed 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.730
 that another hacker group ended up with 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 this group that here had several members 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 wounds and 92 by the fbi 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 these this group surely do not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.629
 simply make up three or four 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.050
 people that is an organization 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.970
 quite complex at the moment there is no 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.890
 a list of countries affected by the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.930
 attack officially but users of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 everyone are reporting the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.190
 inability to access the service 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
 so if you are any part of the globe and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.380
 you can not access xbox live is that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 Well, it's being attacked in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 massive attacks of d &amp; s hopefully the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.660
 service is restored as soon as possible 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.539
 It is not the only service because 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.759
 playstation network is also 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.360
 experiencing problems in many 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.890
 users throughout the world do not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.979
 complaints from users through 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.039
 twitter are counted by thousands so 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.440
 it may also be due to this 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.619
 hate attack that on the part of vicens 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.750
 squad although good we are in poinsettia 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.259
 and there is very little information about it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 so for good you can see in the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.460
 source the description and of saiz by 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 twitter if you play playstation network 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.409
 FoxLife how these complaints are not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.260
 users in the world and you can make a 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 more thorough tracking so good 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.789
 for the moment what is known is that the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.060
 squat news has been attributed the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.660
 moment 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.090
 of xbox live and playstation network that 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 It seems that also good 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.310
 have to see something this group so 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 Well, we'll wait until tomorrow morning 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.050
 when we get up to see if there are more 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.269
 information and we will continue informing 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
 a hug like and favorites and even the 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.050
 next chao
