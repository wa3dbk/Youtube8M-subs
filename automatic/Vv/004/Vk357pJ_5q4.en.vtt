I've<00:03:59.750> gone<00:04:00.080> for<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.440> combination<00:04:00.770> of<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:05.080> little

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
I've gone for a combination of a little

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.600 
I've gone for a combination of a little
combination<00:04:06.320> of<00:04:06.680> anything<00:04:07.040> really<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.460> it

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
combination of anything really is it

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
it's a fucking big car so I like

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.630 
it's a fucking big car so I like
smashing<00:04:10.730> shit<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:12.380> it's<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:13.070> fast<00:04:13.430> enough

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
smashing shit and it's just fast enough

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.640 
smashing shit and it's just fast enough
to<00:04:13.970> get<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.810> checkpoints<00:04:15.440> in<00:04:15.560> time<00:04:17.650> that's

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
to get to the checkpoints in time that's

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.920 
to get to the checkpoints in time that's
why<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.310> really<00:04:19.640> want<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.880> go<00:04:20.000> faster<00:04:20.600> you

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
why if you really want to go faster you

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.560 
why if you really want to go faster you
can<00:04:21.280> get<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> smaller<00:04:22.700> car<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.610> go<00:04:25.760> faster<00:04:26.390> but

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
can get a smaller car and go faster but

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.660 
can get a smaller car and go faster but
I<00:04:26.690> kind<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:27.470> big<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:27.890> because<00:04:28.550> you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
I kind of like this big one because you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.310 
I kind of like this big one because you
can<00:04:28.700> knock<00:04:28.970> over<00:04:29.000> trees<00:04:29.510> without<00:04:29.840> too<00:04:30.170> much
