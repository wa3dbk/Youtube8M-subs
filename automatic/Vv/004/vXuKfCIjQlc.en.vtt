00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
okay all right guys what we have here is

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.710 
okay all right guys what we have here is
you<00:00:01.949> have<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.100> power<00:00:02.310> supply<00:00:02.600> we're<00:00:03.600> just

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
you have a power supply we're just

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.300 
you have a power supply we're just
putting<00:00:03.929> out<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> voltage<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.620> 12<00:00:04.830> volts<00:00:04.890> and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
putting out a voltage of 12 volts and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.220 
putting out a voltage of 12 volts and
took<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> two<00:00:06.299> separate<00:00:06.660> switches<00:00:07.080> so

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
took it up to two separate switches so

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.330 
took it up to two separate switches so
this<00:00:07.319> would<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.529> like<00:00:07.620> your<00:00:07.770> front<00:00:08.040> door

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
this would be like your front door

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.709 
this would be like your front door
switch<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.700> home<00:00:08.849> which<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.179> somebody<00:00:09.540> came<00:00:09.660> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
switch at home which is somebody came to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
switch at home which is somebody came to
visit<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> front<00:00:10.290> door<00:00:10.440> you'd<00:00:11.099> hold<00:00:11.309> this

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
visit you the front door you'd hold this

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
visit you the front door you'd hold this
down<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.210> then<00:00:12.509> if<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.690> ever<00:00:12.809> grew<00:00:12.960> up<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
down and then if you ever grew up in the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480 
down and then if you ever grew up in the
city<00:00:13.410> you'd<00:00:13.559> also<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> rear<00:00:14.130> doorbell

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
city you'd also have a rear doorbell

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.939 
city you'd also have a rear doorbell
that's<00:00:15.179> hooked<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> also<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.710> kind<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
that's hooked up and also it's kind of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
that's hooked up and also it's kind of
cool<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.310> home<00:00:17.580> you'd<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:18.060> your

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
cool is that home you'd see your

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.750 
cool is that home you'd see your
doorbell<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.230> something<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.699> if

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
doorbell like something like this but if

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.010 
doorbell like something like this but if
you<00:00:20.850> ever<00:00:20.939> take<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.390> off<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.689> doorbell

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you ever take all that off your doorbell

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
you ever take all that off your doorbell
and<00:00:22.230> look<00:00:22.410> inside<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.910> actually

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and look inside here you can actually

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.689 
and look inside here you can actually
see<00:00:24.269> there's<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.660> coils<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.140> wire<00:00:25.580> which<00:00:26.580> are

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
see there's two coils of wire which are

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
see there's two coils of wire which are
actually<00:00:26.939> small<00:00:27.180> electromagnets<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
actually small electromagnets and so it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
actually small electromagnets and so it
will<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> electromagnets<00:00:31.140> are

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
will do is so the electromagnets are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
will do is so the electromagnets are
inside<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.180> those<00:00:33.300> copper

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
inside right here you see those copper

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.860

wires<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.290> those<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.649> Springs<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
wires and those are Springs and one of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
wires and those are Springs and one of
the<00:00:36.960> cores<00:00:37.910> has<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> plastic<00:00:39.719> stopper<00:00:40.250> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the cores has a plastic stopper to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.410 
the cores has a plastic stopper to
prevent<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:41.850> hitting<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.020> bill<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:44.040> the

close the switch it pulls in the
electromagnet<00:01:01.800> pulls<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.460> metal

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
electromagnet pulls in the little metal

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
electromagnet pulls in the little metal
bar<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.300> let<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> does

have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> strengthen<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.970> magnetic<00:01:06.750> field

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
have to strengthen the magnetic field

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.050 
have to strengthen the magnetic field
but<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> cool<00:01:08.580> cuz<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.880> you're

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
right here so the electromagnetic just

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.330 
right here so the electromagnetic just
pulls<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.850> iron<00:01:24.119> core<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pulls the iron core in and then when it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
pulls the iron core in and then when it
comes<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.700> stopper<00:01:27.210> stops<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.470> you
