00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to admit the problem you know because I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.340 
to admit the problem you know because I
like<00:00:45.360> Szczesny<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> good

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like Szczesny I think there's a good

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.889 
like Szczesny I think there's a good
goal<00:00:46.620> people<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.700> has<00:00:47.910> made<00:00:48.120> quite<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> few

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
goal people but he has made quite a few

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
goal people but he has made quite a few
errors<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.590> season<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.129> honest<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
errors the season to be honest and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
errors the season to be honest and
costly<00:00:50.910> errors<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.329> kasi<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.170> today

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
costly errors as well kasi and today

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.389 
costly errors as well kasi and today
could<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.680> been<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> same<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
could have been the same because I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
could have been the same because I
didn't<00:00:53.670> play<00:00:53.820> well<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.420> still<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.809> new

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
didn't play well but I was still one new

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
up that was the only shot I think in the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
up that was the only shot I think in the
second<00:00:57.629> half<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.170> had<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.500> had<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> deal
