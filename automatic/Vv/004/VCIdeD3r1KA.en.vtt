00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.020
 our at the reporter acts under today in the Palatinate Forest during the BaumfÃ¤llen 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.020
 Goodbye 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.570
 the culprit i know that's just two points in one speed 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.400
 and welcome today to our weather from the Frank Weiler 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 Community forest yes these Douglas firs behind me the flood of 40 years old and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.169
 Some of them have to believe in exactly 17 of them today 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.609
 namely electricity pylons 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.289
 straight row, the DUH must be glazed so that they become a power pole 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.800
 yes yes and these power poles will not be around 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.690
 Rhineland-Palatinate but sold to Finland you hardly believe it and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.039
 Helgoland who knows why why the Finns buy their dominance in 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.600
 rhineland-palatinate In Finland, there is only a dark version 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.260
 and it is characterized by an enormous durability 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.970
 at least 30 years round and very good handling 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.540
 when setting up the had 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.360
 but they had to be that percent of them own the power pole 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.210
 that's just what he has to be, which is why he is absolutely right because of these allegations 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.810
 uphold to the best 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 around here the sellers wanted to own profile diameter of at least 45 10 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 Today the trees are felled here in a total of 17 pieces we know theirs 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.910
 Forest workers that they are missing the right words 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.790
 Hike to the mark the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.220
 the company is 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.100
 and at the numbered no notice slightly in any weather 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 9 storm not strong storm not and always you have to stay strong 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.160
 rain 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.490
 with a few unpleasant luckily, the construction workers do not just have the 8 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.869
 how trees change 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.080
 wet the second I can promise them 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.789
 No 10 to 14 degrees pulls a rain front over us 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.219
 it is mostly covered partly it pours vigorously 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.509
 only in the north of the country do the clouds break open in the early hours 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.410
 Frankfurt 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 Brown coal 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.040
 because the tree is felled and you can here very nice the annual rings 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.119
 Connoisseurs at Heligoland what might still be so powerful 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.869
 who with whom the length of the striker will have to go through for the foul 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:23.490
 determine 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.079
 then the traffic light 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.599
 the tribe will be 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.609
 Mr. Bayern thank you very much we wish the tree a good trip to Finland 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.109
 and now he betrays me the prospects of the coming days 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.059
 the trees with their white marking lanes so get six trees too 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.549
 Called future trees 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.859
 the forester places special emphasis on preserving these trees 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.719
 Winston respected that people who do not have branches Hamm especially a farms 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.790
 Crown and a particularly thick roots 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.370
 These two should be in 50 years times as good as throw off as are spared 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 and every twelve yards there is a tree in that forest, and that one 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.889
 that's really true 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.920
 1 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.079
 2 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.789
 3 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:06.709
 6 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 7 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.939
 It could also be more meters Dennis rightly considered
