best artwork but you'll probably see in

best artwork but you'll probably see in
this<00:00:45.589> series<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.010> might<00:00:46.309> not<00:00:46.489> always<00:00:46.789> be<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
this series that might not always be the

this series that might not always be the
case<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.929> we<00:00:48.799> thought<00:00:49.370> it'd<00:00:49.549> be<00:00:49.579> best<00:00:49.909> to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
case and we thought it'd be best to

though they had perfect artwork already
now<00:01:35.090> something<00:01:35.390> can<00:01:35.630> be<00:01:35.749> said<00:01:35.780> positive<00:01:36.469> about

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
now something can be said positive about

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760 
now something can be said positive about
the<00:01:37.249> North<00:01:37.670> American<00:01:38.179> region<00:01:38.600> one<00:01:39.049> Street

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
yet but unfortunately the artist

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.690 
yet but unfortunately the artist
couldn't<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:04.080> females<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.980> well<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:05.490> only

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
couldn't do females as well which only

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
couldn't do females as well which only
kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> falls<00:02:06.360> flat<00:02:06.570> unfortunately<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
kind of falls flat unfortunately and I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.250 
kind of falls flat unfortunately and I
believe<00:02:08.160> writers<00:02:08.490> risk<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.150> badly<00:02:09.960> dislocated

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
believe writers risk is badly dislocated

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.740 
believe writers risk is badly dislocated
