00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
if you just could but yeah it's it's not

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
if you just could but yeah it's it's not
possible<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.550> several<00:00:36.090> reasons<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.660> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
possible for several reasons so we can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.750 
possible for several reasons so we can
only<00:00:37.739> may<00:00:38.540> maximal<00:00:39.590> two<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.829> three<00:00:41.070> people<00:00:41.309> let

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
only may maximal two or three people let

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.220 
only may maximal two or three people let
more<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.989> people<00:00:43.320> join<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.430> server<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
more more people join in our server so

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.130 
more more people join in our server so
yeah<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.550> obviously<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:48.809> difficult

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
yeah and it's obviously pretty difficult

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.439 
yeah and it's obviously pretty difficult
to<00:00:49.530> decide<00:00:49.860> between<00:00:50.100> different<00:00:50.730> messages<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to decide between different messages so

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
to decide between different messages so
we<00:00:51.809> thought<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.530> making<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we thought how about making just a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
we thought how about making just a
little<00:00:53.670> contest<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> yeah<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> best<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
little contest and yeah the best the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
little contest and yeah the best the
best<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.059> video<00:01:00.480> responses<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.800> will

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
best in with a video responses here will

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.109 
best in with a video responses here will
actually<00:01:02.510> get<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.719> invitation<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.320> our<00:01:04.470> server
