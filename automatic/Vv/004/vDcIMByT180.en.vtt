00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
a concern just a detail taking a look at
it<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.329> closely<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:05.040> does<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it a little bit more closely it does up

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.480

here<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> jaws<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.010> uses<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.709 

I<00:01:20.579> was<00:01:21.579> concerned<00:01:21.909> at<00:01:22.119> first<00:01:22.149> they<00:01:22.509> seemed

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
I was concerned at first they seemed

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.870 
I was concerned at first they seemed
kind<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:23.020> small<00:01:23.259> but<00:01:24.249> it<00:01:24.369> works<00:01:24.549> for<00:01:24.670> everybody

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
kind of small but it works for everybody

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.130 
kind of small but it works for everybody
fine<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.509> we<00:01:26.020> will<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.439> now<00:01:28.109> back<00:01:29.109> to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
fine and we will see that now back to

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
fine and we will see that now back to
our<00:01:29.380> bottle<00:01:29.679> of<00:01:29.799> Corona<00:01:31.859> moving<00:01:32.859> on<00:01:33.039> this<00:01:33.189> cap

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:02:00.469 

okay<00:01:39.970> spit<00:01:40.210> up

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.030 

and<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.920> easy

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.770 

could<00:02:10.040> use<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.520> line<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.360> think<00:02:11.660> it's

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
could use a little line but I think it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.580 
could use a little line but I think it's
going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.960> make<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.200> rest<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.560> videos

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to make the rest of my videos

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550 
going to make the rest of my videos
pretty<00:02:13.010> easy<00:02:13.250> too
