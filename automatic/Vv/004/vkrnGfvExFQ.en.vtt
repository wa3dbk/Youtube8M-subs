 America live well there is still Hollywood 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.639
 yeah and in america everyone understands that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hollywood movies do not reflect 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.170
 real american life a 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.120
 unfortunately all people who do not live in 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.850
 America think that Hollywood is 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.900
 America 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.250
 and when they watch movies of hollywood 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.039
 which all the well-established clothes in 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.210

 mummy 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.960
 relationship between all spouses such 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.750
 scenario 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 they think that is really the case 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.530
 but in general actually 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.960
 to the big city dax in new york los 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 if you go some small hail you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.310
 come here is a simple supermarket take off 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.670
 people walk there in shlek slippers 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.680
 right senate positions with elongated 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.740
 knees 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.190
 in race walking shdagh without any 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.360
 hairstyles can come to the bank all the colors 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.630
 baking is a completely mundane 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.329
 normal phenomenon and in the cafe can come 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.180
 if it's an evening concert 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 does not wear some evening dresses 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.570
 very rarely come 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.729
 on the graph of burns ordinary plant 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.510
 there were hopes 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.860
 Well, of course those who work and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 for example in a bank or 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 tsamto evaluation and they have some 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050
 requirements kikty enterprises and 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.330
 combat all stores there are requirements for 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.560
 east 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.840
 but mostly percent dress up very 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.420
 simply very many disappear 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.440
 Sacramento and there is a term such a theory 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.560
 that the whole team is noble because 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.890
 what reduces from saving saves 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 resources 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.090
 but there is something even with this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.420
 will agree 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.259
 to some degree minutes but people live 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.100
 not rich 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.649
 no one argues what 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.010
 hollywood in america now it's like 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.570
 that is, cinema 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.500
 we have 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.480
 In fact, the new year in general, what's wrong with 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.910
 tom if did not show well you know there 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.340
 big difference between russian 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.129
 cinema and american which 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.759
 Russian cinema is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.579
 part of art american 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.169
 cinema is this market 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.119
 this is entertainment 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.719
 this is not art this is entertainment 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.189
 officially 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.099
 another category 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.779
 but we, too, so rush from posts in 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.060
 Belarus unfortunately unfortunately very 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 wonder how popular in Russia 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.569
 Hollywood film on it 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.729
 pomom most popular america 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.179
 but in general about how came from born 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:37.109
 american cinema 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.949
 read by Ilf and Petrov 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.960
 there they describe very well 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.469
 like vampires 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.799
 they were there they were in america they 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.319
 visited they figured out and not 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.109
 very clever were they described as abankina 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:50.969
 have taken 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.019
 your own hands percentage m 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.430
 bought weight Hollywood and how they changed the whole 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.179
 the job 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.929
 all art on 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.399
 entertainment industry 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.069
 it was deliberately done 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.499
 how was cancel canceled elena wish 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.859
 what kind of president do 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.029
 the dramas said no more and 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.399
 I pressed down the deaths recently 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.219
 in heart 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.499
 laugh 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.699
 p and 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.509
 panda entertainment 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.959
 but remember that the American capture 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.319
 but that she was so entertaining 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.979
 but now prices are so talented 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.989
 directors who are trying with 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.730
 get out of this course 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.199
 but in general, that was exactly the idea 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.640
 in like this in 1937 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.569
 short 33 50 per annum 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.199
 like so much like the portal krasic 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.409
 many very many politicians 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.009
 relative to american 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.539
 what they said did not do anything
