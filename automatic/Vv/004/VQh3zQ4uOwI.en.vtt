00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.449 
wrap my hair around and then there's a
low<00:03:49.430> bun<00:03:49.880> in<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.299> back<00:03:50.690> into<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.530> side<00:03:51.799> but<00:03:52.430> I

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
low bun in the back into the side but I

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.940 
low bun in the back into the side but I
really<00:03:52.880> think<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.930> bohemian<00:03:54.680> chic

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
really think it's like a bohemian chic

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.120 
really think it's like a bohemian chic
kind<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.730> look<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.180> it's<00:03:56.720> super<00:03:57.410> easy<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.920> do

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
kind of look and it's super easy to do

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.060 
kind of look and it's super easy to do
and<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.760> do<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.180> lot<00:03:59.600> when<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.380> have<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.950> get

up<00:04:01.190> early<00:04:01.489> for<00:04:01.519> class<00:04:01.760> because<00:04:02.150> all<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.600> my

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
up early for class because all of my

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.199 
up early for class because all of my
classes<00:04:03.019> are<00:04:03.440> early<00:04:04.130> in<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.310> morning<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.000> I

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
classes are early in the morning so I

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.240
