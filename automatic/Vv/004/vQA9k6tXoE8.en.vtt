I've<00:01:56.310> been<00:01:56.520> working<00:01:56.819> on<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.359> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I've been working on and kind of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.910 
I've been working on and kind of
massaged<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.049> looked<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.380> local<00:01:58.679> zoning

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
massaged that looked at the local zoning

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
massaged that looked at the local zoning
and<00:01:59.130> building<00:01:59.189> codes<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.060> either<00:02:01.020> tried

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and building codes and just either tried

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.450 
and building codes and just either tried
to<00:02:01.380> kind<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.649> harmonize<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.280> these

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
to kind of harmonize all these

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.370 
to kind of harmonize all these
components<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.450> we've<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.079> working<00:02:04.350> with

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
components that we've been working with

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
components that we've been working with
and<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.939> obviously<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.299> straw<00:02:06.509> bales

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and you know obviously the straw bales

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.730 
and you know obviously the straw bales
are<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.109> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> more<00:02:07.350> technically

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
are one of the more technically

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.200 
are one of the more technically
challenging<00:02:07.829> ones<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.490> not<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
challenging ones that not a lot of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.420 
challenging ones that not a lot of
people<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> fourteen<00:02:11.310> inch

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
people do because it's a fourteen inch

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
people do because it's a fourteen inch
thick<00:02:11.730> wall<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.990> different

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
thick wall and it's a different

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.260 
thick wall and it's a different
structural<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.100> system<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.640> wall<00:02:14.819> system

structural for system and wall system

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.090 
structural for system and wall system
and<00:02:15.420> window<00:02:15.690> system<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:16.980> those

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
and window system and so all those

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.900 
and window system and so all those
details<00:02:17.310> had<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.790> incorporating<00:02:18.360> then

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
details had to be incorporating then

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.150 
details had to be incorporating then

their own physical we had and that was a
lot<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.200> fun<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.890> was<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> great<00:02:52.150> element

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
lot of fun and that was a great element

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.180 
lot of fun and that was a great element
of<00:02:52.660> working<00:02:52.960> together<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.860> we<00:02:53.980> can

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
of working together with you that we can

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.480 
of working together with you that we can
incorporate<00:02:54.820> those<00:02:55.330> sort<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:56.370> elements<00:02:57.370> that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
incorporate those sort of elements that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.010 
incorporate those sort of elements that
we<00:02:57.610> needed<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> save<00:02:58.180> money<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.660> we<00:02:58.780> used

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
we needed to save money so we used

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780 
we needed to save money so we used
volunteers<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.740> mean<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.130> may<00:03:00.490> be<00:03:00.550> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
volunteers I mean that may be that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.070 
volunteers I mean that may be that
wouldn't<00:03:00.970> apply<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.420> lot<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.600> other<00:03:01.780> people

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
wouldn't apply to a lot of other people

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.450 
wouldn't apply to a lot of other people
but<00:03:02.110> that's<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.470> one<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.010> elements<00:03:03.400> of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
but that's just one of the elements of

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060 
but that's just one of the elements of
flexibility<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.140> have<00:03:05.170> so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
flexibility that you that you have so

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.430 
flexibility that you that you have so
that<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.340> we<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:07.300> achieve<00:03:07.570> these<00:03:08.020> kind<00:03:08.320> of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
that we we can achieve these kind of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.430 
that we we can achieve these kind of
very<00:03:09.340> high<00:03:09.610> performing<00:03:10.300> but<00:03:10.750> not<00:03:10.930> always<00:03:11.290> high

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
very high performing but not always high

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.010 
very high performing but not always high
cost<00:03:12.120> buildings<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.300> incorporate<00:03:13.810> different

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
cost buildings and incorporate different

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.510 
cost buildings and incorporate different
kind<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.500> techniques<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> might<00:03:15.130> be<00:03:15.280> straw

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
kind of techniques it might be straw

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.150 
kind of techniques it might be straw
bale<00:03:15.730> but<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.210> do<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> lot<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:17.140> other<00:03:17.800> things

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
bale but you do a lot of other things

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.870 
bale but you do a lot of other things
but<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.880> but<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:21.100> huge

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
but that that but that's I think a huge

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.820 
but that that but that's I think a huge
benefit<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.540> working<00:03:22.660> together<00:03:23.050> with<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.650> was

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
benefit of working together with you was

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.890 
benefit of working together with you was
how<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.910> could<00:03:25.090> accommodate<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.840> be

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
how you could accommodate and be

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.990 
how you could accommodate and be

flexible with with with all the crazy

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.870 
flexible with with with all the crazy
ideas<00:03:28.330> yeah<00:03:29.040> yeah<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.250> then<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.520> still<00:03:30.730> end

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
ideas yeah yeah and then you still end

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.910 
ideas yeah yeah and then you still end
up<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.270> our<00:03:31.420> 40<00:03:31.870> wall<00:03:32.080> which<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.830> know

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
up with in our 40 wall which is you know

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.950 
up with in our 40 wall which is you know
twice<00:03:33.430> what<00:03:33.790> normal<00:03:34.210> construction<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.750> and

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
twice what normal construction is and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.240 
twice what normal construction is and
the<00:03:35.050> thermal<00:03:35.410> mass<00:03:35.560> really<00:03:35.950> helps<00:03:36.130> in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
the thermal mass really helps in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.780 
the thermal mass really helps in
Colorado

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
Colorado

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.640 
Colorado
you<00:03:37.330> know<00:03:37.450> mitigate<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.960> temperature<00:03:38.350> swings

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
you know mitigate the temperature swings

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.010 
you know mitigate the temperature swings
and<00:03:38.830> humidity<00:03:39.550> aspects<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.570> natural

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
and humidity aspects of the natural

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.930 
and humidity aspects of the natural
earth<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.890> plaster<00:03:42.250> that's<00:03:42.370> locally

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
earth and plaster that's locally

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.000 
earth and plaster that's locally
produced<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.930> beauty<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.740> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
produced in the beauty of that is a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.260 
produced in the beauty of that is a
really<00:03:45.280> unique<00:03:45.370> thing<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:45.880> it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
really unique thing so I think it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.640 
really unique thing so I think it
ultimately<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.780> get<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> very<00:03:47.080> technically

science experiment you know
Ilse<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.699> that<00:04:25.820> was<00:04:26.110> true<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.380> process

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
Ilse and that was true of the process

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.700 
Ilse and that was true of the process
choose<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.580> my<00:04:29.270> point<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.930> not<00:04:30.199> easy<00:04:30.440> to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
choose is my point that is not easy to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.670 
choose is my point that is not easy to
do<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.669> be<00:04:31.699> able<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:33.050> go<00:04:33.229> through<00:04:33.259> that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
do and to be able to to go through that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.610 
do and to be able to to go through that
process<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.169> not<00:04:36.169> have<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.410> be<00:04:36.500> a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
process and and not have it be a

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.219 
process and and not have it be a
disaster<00:04:37.280> stay<00:04:37.820> married<00:04:38.150> as<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.080> do

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
disaster stay married as I have to do

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.680 
disaster stay married as I have to do
through<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.620> process<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.270> have

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
through the process and you know I have

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.810 
through the process and you know I have
it<00:04:41.840> be<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> really<00:04:42.860> satisfying<00:04:43.130> journey<00:04:43.699> I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
it be a really satisfying journey I

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.150 
it be a really satisfying journey I
think<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.690> was<00:04:44.900> true<00:04:45.050> yeah<00:04:45.620> alright

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160
