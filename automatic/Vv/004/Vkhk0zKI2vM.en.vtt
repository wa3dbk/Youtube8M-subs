00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.270
 hello my name is jean paul arratia and in 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.670
 this video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.019
 internal configuration of the brain the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.789
 internal brain is formed by 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.099
 different structures each of the 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.900
 which fulfills a different function and 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.299
 determined within the inner brain 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.390
 we'll start talking about the structures 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.390
 innermost to the outermost 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.699
 first of all the thalamus 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.430
 the thalamus is a neuronal structure that 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.310
 originates in the brain the division 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.050
 of the forebrain in the embryo is the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.350
 most voluminous structure in this area 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.629
 is in the center of the brain above 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.720
 of the hypothalamus and separated from it by the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.150
 monroe tare furrow monroe 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.000
 its location is very important because 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.220
 if it will suffer any damage we could not 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.020
 receive certain stimuli for this 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.680
 motive is at the center of our 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.930
 encephalon the next the force knicks 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.510
 it's a set of nervous people in 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 way of being of the brain 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.739
 and carry the signals of this type field 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.690
 to the hypothalamus as well as from a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 hemisphere to the other 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.890
 from a function point of view 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.930
 of forn and x this fibrous structure 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.850
 participates in the union of all those 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 elements of the limbic system of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.740
 right hemisphere with those of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 left hemisphere connecting areas 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.210
 anterior cortical with areas 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.230
 posterior cortical against lateral 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 that is to say that it crosses the information 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.369
 the hypothalamus 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.039
 this is a nuclear region of the brain 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.890
 that is part of the brain day and it 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.259
 places below the thalamus is the region 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 of the most important brain for 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.130
 coordination of essential behaviors 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.189
 linked to the maintenance of 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.649
 species regulates the release of hormones 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.220
 of the pituitary gland maintains the temperature 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.579
 body and organizes behaviors such as 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.829
 feeding liquid intake 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.689
 mating and aggression is the regulator 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.450
 central visceral functions 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.690
 autonomous and endocrine 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.240
 the pituitary gland or hypothesis 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.250
 is a great endocrine question that segregates 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.980
 hormones responsible for regulating 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.290
 homeostasis including hormones 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.710
 tropics that regulate the function of 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.420
 other glands of the endocrine system 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.730
 depending in part on the hypothalamus the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.410
 which in turn regular secretion of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.380
 some hormones 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.480
 the corpus callosum the corpus callosum is 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.390
 the most extensive nerve fiber ace 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.730
 of the human brain its function is that of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.970
 serve as a means of communication between a 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.950
 cerebral hemisphere and another in order to 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.130
 that both sides of the brain work 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 joint and complementary form 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.830
 the hippocampus is a marginal structure 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.650
 and less complex in terms of layers of 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.620
 same cortical gray substance of the lobule 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.350
 temporary for that reason it belongs by a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.140
 part to the limbic system and on the other to the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.450
 arc and bark composing next to his 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.690
 vehicle and the dentate gyrus the call 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.490
 hippocampal formation 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.280
 just like the rest of the cortex 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.230
 cerebral is a varied structure with 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.610
 two halves that are mirror images 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.250
 in both cerebral hemispheres 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.230
 and finally the singular convolution 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.720
 is found in the marginal portion of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.390
 the cerebral cortex on the surface 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.300
 internal of the cerebral hemisphere and born to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.160
 Circle level of the corpus callosum 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.190
 where it joins with the previous end of 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.950
 the internal perpendicular convolution 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.010
 and forms a tiny lobe called 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.129
 Olfactory crossroads or drill center 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.560
 and those were all the structures of the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.310
 internal configuration of the brain this 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.470
 it was my video 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.489
 thank you very much for listening and many 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.120
 thanks for your attention 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.120
 good afternoon
