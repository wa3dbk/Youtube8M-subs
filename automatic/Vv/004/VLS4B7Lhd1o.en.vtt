which<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.490> wasn't<00:02:02.820> too<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:04.320> wasn't<00:02:04.710> expecting<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
which I wasn't too I wasn't expecting it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
which I wasn't too I wasn't expecting it
because<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.939> usually<00:02:06.329> suck<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.689> building<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
because I usually suck at building and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
because I usually suck at building and
that's<00:02:07.979> why<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> wanted<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.640> put

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that's why I wanted to kind of put

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.020 
that's why I wanted to kind of put
building<00:02:09.450> into<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.929> series<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.500> because

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
building into this series more because

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.750 
building into this series more because
building<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.900> fun<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:13.160> want<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.580> good

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
at it and that's the basic gist of it so

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.270 
at it and that's the basic gist of it so
here<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.150> that's<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.069> decided<00:02:19.069> to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
here we go that's that and decided to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.790 
here we go that's that and decided to
replace<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.240> glass<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.020> month<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080 
replace the glass of the month the
cobblestone<00:02:22.220> there<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.490> mossy<00:02:22.790> cobblestone

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
cobblestone there with mossy cobblestone

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.710 
cobblestone there with mossy cobblestone
and<00:02:23.709> that's<00:02:24.709> about<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.360> here<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.690> can

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
and that's about that so here you can

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.160 
and that's about that so here you can
see<00:02:26.900> kind<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.650> end<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:29.030> build<00:02:29.270> ah<00:02:29.569> i

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
