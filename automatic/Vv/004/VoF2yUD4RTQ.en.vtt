00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.200
 Consider a pretty good mod. 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 which adds to the maykravt umbrellas with 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 which you can not only 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.920
 shelter from the rain but also very 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.199
 It looks nice Well to begin with as a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.359
 usually let's show you how everything 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 do we have to open this umbrella 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.789
 menu crafting workbench and put 2 these 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 shelves on a workbench like this 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 then we need to decide on the color 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 our future umbrella well, as you can see 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 only red in my inventory 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.040
 dye and therefore accordingly our 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 the umbrella will be red and you can 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
 take that dye that suits you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.270
 to taste the most well then we place 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.489
 this dye here in these cells well and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 then take three pieces of plain white 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 wool fill them completely upper 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 tier workbench but as you can see here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 This is a red umbrella 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 let's take it from the workbench and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.030
 take in hand and as you can see it looks 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.190
 this umbrella is pretty cool and even 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 the coolest thing about umbrellas is that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.470
 if you are holding it click on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 right mouse button then you automatically 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 bounce up and bounce 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.710
 you are very high thus you 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 can easily climb on all sorts 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.650
 houses cliff hills but also on other similar 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.270
