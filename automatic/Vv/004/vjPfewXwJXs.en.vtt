they're from the late 60s I want to show
you<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.789> inside<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.480> screaming<00:00:30.779> bird

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
you the inside of the screaming bird

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.270 
you the inside of the screaming bird
which<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> very<00:00:32.940> nice<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> tidy<00:00:33.980> PCB<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
which is a very nice and tidy PCB and it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.190 
which is a very nice and tidy PCB and it
helps<00:00:35.550> us<00:00:35.670> keep<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.090> consistent<00:00:36.390> from

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
helps us keep things consistent from

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
helps us keep things consistent from
unit<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> unit<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:38.700> course<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.210> our<00:00:39.239> units<00:00:39.629> are

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
unit to unit of course all our units are

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.830 
unit to unit of course all our units are
hand<00:00:40.110> tested<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.710> listened<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.399> house<00:00:41.840> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
hand tested and listened to in house and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.400 
hand tested and listened to in house and
I<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.960> one<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.170> first

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I also have for you one of our first

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
I also have for you one of our first
prototype<00:00:46.710> PCBs<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.780> screaming<00:00:49.200> bird<00:00:49.789> get

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
prototype PCBs of the screaming bird get

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
prototype PCBs of the screaming bird get
a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.059> closer<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
a little closer there this is what the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.970 
a little closer there this is what the
top<00:00:52.620> looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.329> again<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.649> as

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
top looks like and again the back so as

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.709 
top looks like and again the back so as
you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> hand<00:00:57.239> wash<00:00:57.420> some

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you can see we have to hand wash some

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.180 
you can see we have to hand wash some
stuff<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.320> didn't<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> perfect<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
stuff in we didn't get it perfect the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.360 
stuff in we didn't get it perfect the
first<00:00:59.399> time<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.120> okay<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
first time but that's okay and then the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
first time but that's okay and then the
last<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.809> an

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
last thing I have for you is an

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
last thing I have for you is an
oscilloscope<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> swept<00:01:06.000> sine

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
oscilloscope over here with a swept sine

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
oscilloscope over here with a swept sine
wave<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.960> about<00:01:07.409> 20<00:01:07.830> Hertz<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> 20

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
wave going through about 20 Hertz to 20

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
wave going through about 20 Hertz to 20
kilohertz<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.930> through<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
kilohertz and it's going through one of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.340 
kilohertz and it's going through one of
our<00:01:10.770> screaming<00:01:11.490> burg<00:01:11.640> prototypes<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.170> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
our screaming burg prototypes so right

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
our screaming burg prototypes so right
now<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.710> looking<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.040> bypass<00:01:14.970> mode<00:01:15.240> which

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
now we're looking at bypass mode which

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.320 
now we're looking at bypass mode which
is<00:01:15.659> true<00:01:15.930> bypass<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.680> both<00:01:17.009> units<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.060> click

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is true bypass in both units and I click

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
is true bypass in both units and I click
it<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> screaming<00:01:20.850> bird

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it on as you can see in a screaming bird

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.859 
it on as you can see in a screaming bird
we<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:23.060> filtering<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.689> base

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
we are filtering out some base

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
we are filtering out some base
frequencies<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.830> boosting<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> treble

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
frequencies and boosting the treble

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
frequencies and boosting the treble
frequencies<00:01:27.500> now<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.009> let's<00:01:29.430> bypass

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
frequencies now right now let's bypass

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
frequencies now right now let's bypass
we're<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.450> boosting<00:01:30.960> too<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
we're not boosting too much of the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
we're not boosting too much of the
treble<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.640> actually<00:01:32.759> turn<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.329> up

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
treble but I can actually turn this up

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
treble but I can actually turn this up
and<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.500> goes<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and you can see it goes way off the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.819 
and you can see it goes way off the
screen<00:01:35.570> each<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.049> screaming<00:01:37.439> bird<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
screen each the screaming bird and the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.330 
screen each the screaming bird and the
mole<00:01:37.979> each<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> volume<00:01:38.880> knob<00:01:39.210> basically

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
mole each have a volume knob basically

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.649 
mole each have a volume knob basically
if<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.490> turn<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> screaming<00:01:42.180> bird<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> way

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
if I turn the screaming bird all the way

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.530 
if I turn the screaming bird all the way
down<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.200> nothing<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.149> screaming

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
down you get nothing out and screaming

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.780 
down you get nothing out and screaming
your<00:01:45.750> bird<00:01:45.899> boosts<00:01:46.560> from<00:01:47.369> 1.6<00:01:48.210> kilohertz<00:01:48.960> up

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
your bird boosts from 1.6 kilohertz up

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.830 
your bird boosts from 1.6 kilohertz up
so<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:53.130> maximum<00:01:53.610> boost<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.210> 2.5

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so it's maximum boost is at 2.5

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.450 
so it's maximum boost is at 2.5
kilohertz<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.250> maximum<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.759> 20

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
kilohertz which is the maximum was 20
