go to the CAPTCHA screen and then try to
check<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.079> delay<00:00:43.290> I'm

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
check out so because of that delay I'm

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.310 
check out so because of that delay I'm
pretty<00:00:43.710> sure<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> ended<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.309> failing<00:00:44.809> also<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
pretty sure I ended up failing also the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
pretty sure I ended up failing also the
other<00:00:46.500> laptop<00:00:46.980> again<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.610> eight

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
other laptop again was about eight

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
other laptop again was about eight
seconds<00:00:48.239> faster<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.870> mentioned<00:00:49.200> any<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
seconds faster as I mentioned any time I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.229 
seconds faster as I mentioned any time I
clicked<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> link<00:00:50.309> after<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.850> opened<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
clicked a link after I opened the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
clicked a link after I opened the
original<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.469> eight<00:00:52.649> seconds

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
original one it was about eight seconds

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
original one it was about eight seconds
faster<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:54.180> leads<00:00:54.480> me<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> believe<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
faster which leads me to believe if you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.180 
faster which leads me to believe if you
click<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> link<00:00:55.680> earlier<00:00:56.870> from<00:00:57.870> Nike<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
click the link earlier from Nike for the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
click the link earlier from Nike for the
actual<00:00:59.609> countdown<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.859> allows<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
actual countdown it actually allows you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.390 
actual countdown it actually allows you
to<00:01:02.430> try<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> check<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.300> faster<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to try to check out faster but again it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
to try to check out faster but again it
doesn't<00:01:05.549> matter<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:07.320> failing<00:01:07.770> for

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
doesn't matter because I'm failing for

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
doesn't matter because I'm failing for
myself<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.090> happened<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
transition to the other screen that I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420 
transition to the other screen that I
had<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.649> putting<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> CAPTCHA<00:01:47.340> on

had and I was putting in the CAPTCHA on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
had and I was putting in the CAPTCHA on
this<00:01:47.610> side<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.630> ends<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.930> freezing<00:01:49.229> on

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this side and it ends up freezing on

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590 
this side and it ends up freezing on
here<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.939> know<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.420> deal<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here so I don't know what the deal is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310 
here so I don't know what the deal is
but<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.759> computer<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> always

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
but my on my computer like it always

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.410 
but my on my computer like it always
ends<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.710> freezing<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.520> caption<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.240> don't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
ends up freezing on the caption I don't
understand<00:01:57.780> why<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.860> didn't<00:01:59.340> freeze

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
understand why this one it didn't freeze

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
understand why this one it didn't freeze
right<00:01:59.759> away<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.210> popped<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.810> another<00:02:01.020> CAPTCHA

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
right away it popped up another CAPTCHA

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
right away it popped up another CAPTCHA
and<00:02:01.649> then<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> added<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> looked

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and then I added it and then it looked

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.639 
and then I added it and then it looked
like<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.930> adding<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> cart

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
like it was gonna be adding it to cart

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.990 
like it was gonna be adding it to cart
meanwhile<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.340> one's<00:02:05.549> still<00:02:05.729> waiting<00:02:05.969> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
meanwhile this one's still waiting for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
meanwhile this one's still waiting for
my<00:02:06.149> turn<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.840> could<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> another<00:02:07.799> thing

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
my turn so this could be a another thing

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.109 
my turn so this could be a another thing
that's<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> smart<00:02:08.520> idea<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that's not a smart idea because it's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
that's not a smart idea because it's
limit<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.739> logged<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.129> the

limit one and if I'm logged into the

limit one and if I'm logged into the
same<00:02:11.459> account

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and I'm trying to get the sneakers and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.870 
and I'm trying to get the sneakers and
you<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> log<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.430> same<00:02:16.580> account

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you if you log in to the same account

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.700 
you if you log in to the same account
from<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.540> different<00:02:17.840> windows<00:02:18.170> it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
from from different windows it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.140 
from from different windows it's
probably<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> really<00:02:19.100> bad<00:02:19.280> idea<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> try<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.940> add

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
probably a really bad idea to try to add

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.940 
probably a really bad idea to try to add
to<00:02:20.270> cart'<00:02:20.450> more<00:02:20.660> than<00:02:20.750> one<00:02:20.960> because<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.800> would

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
to cart' more than one because it would

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.980 
to cart' more than one because it would
probably<00:02:22.160> get<00:02:22.400> caught<00:02:22.610> up<00:02:22.780> regardless<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.870> was

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
probably get caught up regardless I was

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.180 
probably get caught up regardless I was
trying<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.320> because<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.740> was<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> different

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
trying to because it was a different

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.370 
trying to because it was a different
size<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.400> if<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.300> nine<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
size and if I got a nine and one and a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.530 
size and if I got a nine and one and a
half<00:02:27.410> another<00:02:27.710> one<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:29.060> if<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.180> only<00:02:29.330> got<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
half another one more if I only got a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140 
half another one more if I only got a
chance<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.990> get<00:02:30.170> one<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.410> them<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150

thought it would have helped my chances

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
people that did or that we're able to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.330 
actually cop the sneakers and so it's
it's<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> second<00:03:10.220> time

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
it's like this is the second time

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.560 
it's like this is the second time

they've done the countdown that I can

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.760

remember<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.870> did<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> video<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.500> really

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
remember I did a video on that really

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.230 
remember I did a video on that really
the<00:03:12.860> first<00:03:13.010> time<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.400> well<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.850> failed

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
the first time as well and I failed

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640 
the first time as well and I failed
but<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.020> second<00:03:15.320> time<00:03:15.440> as<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
but this is the second time as a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.930 
but this is the second time as a
follow-up<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.100> figured<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.430> do<00:03:16.490> this<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:16.850> your

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
follow-up I figured I do this for your

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.850 
follow-up I figured I do this for your
guys's<00:03:17.240> sake<00:03:17.420> as<00:03:18.110> well<00:03:18.170> as<00:03:18.350> actually<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.770> know

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
guys's sake as well as actually I know

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.400 
guys's sake as well as actually I know
some<00:03:19.130> people<00:03:19.250> over<00:03:19.490> at<00:03:19.580> Nike<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.510> have<00:03:21.110> seen

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
some people over at Nike that have seen

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.910 
some people over at Nike that have seen
my<00:03:21.770> other<00:03:21.800> video<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.720> they're<00:03:23.870> aware<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.709> I

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
my other video so they're aware like I

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.110 
my other video so they're aware like I
think<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.190> probably<00:03:25.430> good<00:03:25.640> feedback<00:03:25.940> for

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
think it's probably good feedback for

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.420 
think it's probably good feedback for
them<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.330> see<00:03:27.230> from<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> consumer<00:03:27.950> side<00:03:28.100> of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
them to see from the consumer side of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.630 
them to see from the consumer side of
what<00:03:28.910> we're<00:03:29.060> having<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.570> see<00:03:30.520> since<00:03:31.520> they

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
what we're having to see since they

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.130 
what we're having to see since they
change<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:31.970> from<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.150> Twitter<00:03:32.420> link<00:03:32.600> only<00:03:32.810> I

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
didn't work and again just so you guys

know<00:04:48.479> again<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.349> other<00:04:49.379> laptop<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.370> was

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
know again on the other laptop it was

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.570 
know again on the other laptop it was
much<00:04:50.729> faster<00:04:51.740> ahead<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.860> time<00:04:52.979> than<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.310> one

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
much faster ahead of time than this one

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.520 
much faster ahead of time than this one
and<00:04:53.759> it<00:04:54.419> still<00:04:54.780> gave<00:04:54.900> me<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.110> same<00:04:55.289> exact

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
and it still gave me the same exact

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.779 
and it still gave me the same exact
error<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:55.919> guys<00:04:56.069> saw<00:04:56.280> in<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.490> screen

error that you guys saw in this screen

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.120 
error that you guys saw in this screen

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
and then they had it then the out of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.860 
and then they had it then the out of
stock<00:04:59.280> popped<00:04:59.550> up<00:04:59.699> in<00:04:59.789> all<00:05:00.000> three<00:05:00.300> at<00:05:00.569> the

stock popped up in all three at the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.219 
stock popped up in all three at the
exact<00:05:01.199> same<00:05:01.409> time<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:01.710> kind<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.580> bummer

unfortunately<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:14.009> probably<00:05:14.220> gonna<00:05:14.340> be

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
unfortunately this is probably gonna be

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.279 
unfortunately this is probably gonna be
the<00:05:14.490> same<00:05:14.669> thing<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.479> happens<00:05:15.870> when<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.080> try

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.700 
the same thing that happens when I try
to<00:05:16.349> get<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.830> other<00:05:16.860> LeBrons<00:05:17.460> drop<00:05:18.419> in<00:05:18.620> which<00:05:19.620> I

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
to get the other LeBrons drop in which I

do<00:05:19.770> want<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.370> elites<00:05:20.699> as<00:05:20.909> well<00:05:21.090> even<00:05:21.330> if<00:05:21.449> the
