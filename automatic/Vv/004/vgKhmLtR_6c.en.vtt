it<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.349> I<00:02:01.619> hit<00:02:02.069> this<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.399> far<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> fastest<00:02:03.119> I've

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
it up I hit this as far the fastest I've

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.059 
it up I hit this as far the fastest I've
ever<00:02:03.299> gone<00:02:03.569> I<00:02:03.629> was<00:02:04.020> floored<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:04.530> second<00:02:04.920> gear

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
ever gone I was floored in second gear

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.039 
ever gone I was floored in second gear
smoke<00:02:05.579> billowing<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.239> my<00:02:06.329> car<00:02:06.569> and<00:02:06.599> after

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
smoke billowing out of my car and after

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
smoke billowing out of my car and after
I<00:02:07.079> got<00:02:07.319> I<00:02:07.530> straighten<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.099> everything<00:02:08.489> was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I got I straighten it up everything was

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
I got I straighten it up everything was
super<00:02:09.000> smooth<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> look<00:02:09.629> behind<00:02:09.959> me<00:02:10.079> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
super smooth and a look behind me and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.259 
super smooth and a look behind me and
her<00:02:10.799> smoke<00:02:11.190> everywhere<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.090> probably

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
her smoke everywhere and I was probably

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.729 
her smoke everywhere and I was probably
one<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> coolest<00:02:12.959> feelings<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.560> have

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
one of the coolest feelings I have

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.020 
one of the coolest feelings I have
because<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.220> point<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.549> was<00:02:14.670> probably<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
because at that point I was probably the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.970 
because at that point I was probably the
best<00:02:15.360> drift<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.079> would<00:02:16.230> always<00:02:16.379> dictate

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
best drift like I would always dictate

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
best drift like I would always dictate
what<00:02:17.129> was<00:02:17.250> better<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.910> was

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
what was better and how I was

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.289 
what was better and how I was
progressing<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.959> really<00:02:19.799> follow<00:02:19.980> my<00:02:20.280> my<00:02:20.700> own

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
progressing and really follow my my own

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.780 
progressing and really follow my my own
driving<00:02:21.900> skill<00:02:22.379> level<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.829> try<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> progress

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
driving skill level to try to progress

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.000 
driving skill level to try to progress
to<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.000> next<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:25.170> was<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.829> was<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to the next and that was that was a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.059 
to the next and that was that was a
really<00:02:26.340> cool<00:02:26.579> moment<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:27.030> me<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.540> kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
really cool moment for me and kind of a

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
really cool moment for me and kind of a
stepping<00:02:29.069> stone<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.579> I<00:02:30.000> guess<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.810> know
