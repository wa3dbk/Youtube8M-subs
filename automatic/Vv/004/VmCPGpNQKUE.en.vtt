talking about for a little bit our pool
that<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.099> family<00:00:29.730> made<00:00:30.119> ourselves<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:31.679> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that we family made ourselves that it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.860 
that we family made ourselves that it's
40<00:00:32.430> foot<00:00:32.700> long<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:34.290> 20<00:00:34.680> foot<00:00:34.920> wide<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
40 foot long and it's 20 foot wide and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
40 foot long and it's 20 foot wide and
it's<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.170> three<00:00:37.559> foot<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.640> shallow<00:00:38.969> end

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it's from three foot in the shallow end

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
it's from three foot in the shallow end
and<00:00:39.710> six<00:00:40.710> foot<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> deep<00:00:41.670> end<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.620> we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and six foot in the deep end and we

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.459 
and six foot in the deep end and we
think<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> there's<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.410> 22,000<00:00:46.410> gallons

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
think that there's about 22,000 gallons

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.400 
think that there's about 22,000 gallons
of<00:00:47.010> water<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:48.530> people<00:00:49.530> tells<00:00:49.860> us<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
of water there people tells us that you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.779 
of water there people tells us that you
need<00:00:52.410> about<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:53.160> gallons<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.570> water<00:00:54.840> per<00:00:54.989> fish

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
need about two gallons of water per fish

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.060 
need about two gallons of water per fish
but<00:00:56.789> basically<00:00:57.270> we're<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.199> guessing<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
but basically we're just guessing a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.569 
but basically we're just guessing a
couple<00:00:59.879> years<00:01:00.120> ago<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.960> around<00:01:01.579> 5,000

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
couple years ago we had around 5,000

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.880 
couple years ago we had around 5,000
fish<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.629> started<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.820> 100<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
fish we started with 100 and out of that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 
fish we started with 100 and out of that
hundred<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.060> year<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.380> had<00:01:10.619> close<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
hundred in one year we had close to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
hundred in one year we had close to
5,000<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.619> were<00:01:13.650> reading

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
5,000 at one time they were reading

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.499 
5,000 at one time they were reading
about<00:01:14.689> 75<00:01:15.689> gallon<00:01:16.259> buckets<00:01:17.000> every<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.180> day

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
about 75 gallon buckets every other day

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.429 
about 75 gallon buckets every other day
of<00:01:18.900> duck<00:01:19.470> weed<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.939> doesn't<00:01:21.330> cost<00:01:21.479> anything<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
of duck weed it doesn't cost anything it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.660 
of duck weed it doesn't cost anything it
is<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.810> found<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
is to go get it and we found that we the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.080 
is to go get it and we found that we the
water<00:01:26.909> hyacinths<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> fisherman<00:01:29.340> hates<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
water hyacinths the fisherman hates the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
water hyacinths the fisherman hates the
water<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.720> sins<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.790> rivers<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.090> lake

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
water I sins in the rivers and the lake

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.469 
water I sins in the rivers and the lake
because<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.110> stops<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.729> hard<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.210> run

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
because it stops up and it's hard to run

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.319 
because it stops up and it's hard to run
on<00:01:36.689> motor<00:01:36.960> boat<00:01:37.290> through<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> hyacinth<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
on motor boat through the hyacinth so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
on motor boat through the hyacinth so
basically<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.409> fisherman<00:01:40.950> doesn't<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
basically the fisherman doesn't like it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
basically the fisherman doesn't like it
but<00:01:42.630> us<00:01:42.930> raising<00:01:43.350> fish<00:01:43.979> tilapia<00:01:44.990> it's<00:01:45.990> good

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
but us raising fish tilapia it's good

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
but us raising fish tilapia it's good
because<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.950> helps<00:01:47.310> feed<00:01:47.610> them<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.570> puts<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
because it helps feed them it puts out a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.330 
because it helps feed them it puts out a
white<00:01:50.009> route

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
white route

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.880 
white route
and<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:53.039> fish<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:55.119> don't<00:01:55.359> eat<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.229> top<00:01:56.259> of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
and the fish they don't eat the top of

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.919 
and the fish they don't eat the top of
the<00:01:57.219> high<00:01:57.640> center<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.240> they<00:01:58.390> do<00:01:58.450> eat<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
the high center but they do eat the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.200 
the high center but they do eat the
roots<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.500> my<00:01:59.890> left<00:02:00.189> here<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.619> had<00:02:02.829> a<00:02:02.859> spa<00:02:03.340> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
roots to my left here we had a spa to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.749 
roots to my left here we had a spa to
sit<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.719> and<00:02:04.929> relax<00:02:05.409> for<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.859> family<00:02:06.429> but<00:02:06.579> it

sit in and relax for the family but it
ended<00:02:07.090> up<00:02:07.240> being<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.810> biofilter<00:02:08.700> system<00:02:09.700> for

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
ended up being a biofilter system for

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.390 
ended up being a biofilter system for
the<00:02:10.000> fish<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.410> take<00:02:11.620> some<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.190> that

and it's eiffels out to where the fish
is<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.200> then<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.700> dry<00:02:31.290> your<00:02:32.290> walk<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.860> dry

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
is and then it is dry your walk is dry

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.100 
is and then it is dry your walk is dry
where<00:02:34.120> your<00:02:34.299> plants<00:02:34.810> roots<00:02:35.140> are<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:36.220> 12<00:02:37.150> 15<00:02:37.930> 18

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
where your plants roots are for 12 15 18

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
where your plants roots are for 12 15 18
minutes<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.150> then<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:40.599> that's<00:02:40.780> dry<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
minutes and then when that's dry the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.569 
minutes and then when that's dry the
plants<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.379> because<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:45.160> doesn't

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
plants like that because it doesn't

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.150 
plants like that because it doesn't
drown<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.959> plant<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.530> gives<00:02:47.769> them<00:02:47.980> a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
drown the plant it gives them a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.920 
drown the plant it gives them a
opportunity<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.599> get<00:02:49.959> fresh<00:02:51.000> oxygen<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.239> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
opportunity to get fresh oxygen and so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.640 
opportunity to get fresh oxygen and so
then<00:02:53.260> when<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.860> goes<00:02:54.489> dry<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:56.109> takes<00:02:56.470> about

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
then when that goes dry it takes about

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.270 
then when that goes dry it takes about
10<00:02:57.220> or<00:02:57.400> 12<00:02:57.430> 15<00:02:58.269> minutes<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.780> without<00:02:59.709> water<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
10 or 12 15 minutes so without water to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.910 
10 or 12 15 minutes so without water to
come<00:03:00.489> back<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.030> fill<00:03:01.329> up<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.720> wet<00:03:02.380> your<00:03:02.650> plan
