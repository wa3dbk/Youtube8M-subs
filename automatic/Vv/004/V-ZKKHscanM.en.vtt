00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
this is little Z rapid just downstream

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.140 
this is little Z rapid just downstream
of<00:00:03.870> initiation<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:05.400> can<00:00:05.520> see<00:00:05.670> kind<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.940> tight

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
of initiation you can see kind of tight

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.220 
of initiation you can see kind of tight
and<00:00:06.330> technical<00:00:06.810> there's<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> bunch<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
and technical there's a bunch of

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.600 
and technical there's a bunch of
different<00:00:07.529> lines<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.890> can<00:00:08.010> run<00:00:08.160> here<00:00:08.400> through

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610

this<00:00:08.730> thing<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.210> guess<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> easiest<00:00:10.440> thing<00:00:10.889> you

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this thing I guess the easiest thing you

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
this thing I guess the easiest thing you
can<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:11.519> down<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.940> far<00:00:12.150> right<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> this

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
can do is go down the far right of this

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.209 
can do is go down the far right of this
thing<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.019> kind<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.349> straight<00:00:13.650> shot<00:00:13.920> there

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
thing is kind of a straight shot there

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.589 
thing is kind of a straight shot there
you<00:00:14.370> enter<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.820> stay<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.059> down<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> right

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
you enter and you stay on down the right

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
you enter and you stay on down the right
side<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> nice<00:00:17.160> white<00:00:17.460> water

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
side there's actually a nice white water

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
side there's actually a nice white water
hit<00:00:18.000> there<00:00:18.240> waiting<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
hit there waiting for you and for the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.109 
hit there waiting for you and for the
kayakers<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.850> pretty<00:00:20.880> good

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
kayakers it's actually a pretty good

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.230 
kayakers it's actually a pretty good
little<00:00:21.390> surf<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.400> another<00:00:23.580> line<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little surf so it's another line here is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000 
little surf so it's another line here is
the<00:00:24.420> left-hand<00:00:24.960> line<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> little<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.800> tight

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the left-hand line a little more tight

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
the left-hand line a little more tight
and<00:00:26.220> technical<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.910> guess<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and technical I guess that's where this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
and technical I guess that's where this
rapid<00:00:28.289> derives<00:00:28.560> its<00:00:28.710> name<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.189> Z<00:00:29.429> kind<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
rapid derives its name little Z kind of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.450 
rapid derives its name little Z kind of

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
make a couple Z moves down through there

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.590 
make a couple Z moves down through there
