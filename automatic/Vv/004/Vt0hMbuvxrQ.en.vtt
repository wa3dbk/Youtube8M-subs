this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.599> longboard<00:00:01.199> technology<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.689> I<00:00:03.689> would

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
this is longboard technology and I would

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.360 
this is longboard technology and I would
like<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.230> introduce<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.990> something

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
like to introduce to you something

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:17.120 
like to introduce to you something
extraordinary<00:00:15.560> right<00:00:16.560> here

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
extraordinary right here

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.240 
extraordinary right here
we<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:19.050> world's<00:00:19.680> first<00:00:20.300> P<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
we have the world's first P to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
we have the world's first P to
revolution<00:00:23.250> skateboard<00:00:23.910> truck<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:25.050> is

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
revolution skateboard truck that is

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.250 
revolution skateboard truck that is
entirely<00:00:25.880> floating<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:28.010> polyurethane<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
entirely floating in polyurethane so we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.600 
entirely floating in polyurethane so we
got<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> truck<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.399> got<00:00:32.520> these

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
got here on this truck is it's got these

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
got here on this truck is it's got these
two<00:00:32.850> big<00:00:33.120> fat<00:00:33.719> shims<00:00:34.079> right<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.800> right

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
two big fat shims right here and right

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.630 
two big fat shims right here and right
here<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:37.399> do<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> lot

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
here and what they do is they do a lot

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.979 
here and what they do is they do a lot
of<00:00:38.670> things<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.660> dampen<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> ride<00:00:40.800> they

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
of things but they dampen the ride they

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
of things but they dampen the ride they
you<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.110> provide<00:00:43.469> cushioning<00:00:43.950> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you know provide cushioning they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
you know provide cushioning they
increase<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> tolerances<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.320> provide

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
increase the tolerances they provide

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.029 
increase the tolerances they provide
more<00:00:46.829> flexible<00:00:47.430> tolerances<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.440> they<00:00:49.440> just

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
more flexible tolerances and they just

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.889 
more flexible tolerances and they just
make<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.300> completely

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
make it so that it's just completely

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
make it so that it's just completely
incredible<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.670> channel<00:00:54.030> trucks<00:00:54.390> are

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
incredible so the channel trucks are

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
incredible so the channel trucks are
inherently<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> lot<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.860> tolerant<00:00:56.280> than

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
inherently a lot more tolerant than

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970 
inherently a lot more tolerant than
other<00:00:56.910> truck<00:00:57.210> designs<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.530> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
other truck designs because they have so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
other truck designs because they have so
much<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.309> surface<00:00:59.730> area<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.629> able<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
much more surface area to be able to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.799 
much more surface area to be able to
hold<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.649> axle<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.030> path<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.629> it's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
hold the axle in the path that it's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
hold the axle in the path that it's
supposed<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> traveling<00:01:05.090> because<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.390> these

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
supposed to traveling because of these

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
supposed to traveling because of these
rubber<00:01:07.140> shims<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.670> enhances<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
rubber shims it just enhances this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.429 
rubber shims it just enhances this
ability<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.640> incredible<00:01:11.640> degree<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
ability to incredible degree and I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
ability to incredible degree and I
believe<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.850> might<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
believe that this actually might make it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.399 
believe that this actually might make it
so<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.290> truck<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:18.049> makes<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
so this truck right here makes it so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.420 
so this truck right here makes it so
that<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.759> axle<00:01:20.759> travels<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.740> truest<00:01:23.159> path

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that the axle travels in the truest path

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
that the axle travels in the truest path
of<00:01:23.780> any<00:01:24.780> truck<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:27.090> heard<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> here

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
of any truck out there you heard it here

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
of any truck out there you heard it here
first<00:01:27.659> ladies<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.590> gentlemen<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
first ladies and gentlemen now that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
first ladies and gentlemen now that
we've<00:01:30.450> demonstrated<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> works<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> why

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
we've demonstrated how it works and why

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
we've demonstrated how it works and why
we're<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.340> excited<00:01:32.390> we're<00:01:33.390> gonna<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.659> some

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we're so excited we're gonna do some

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
we're so excited we're gonna do some
drop<00:01:34.020> tests<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> let<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> listen<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
drop tests and let you listen to the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.240 
drop tests and let you listen to the
truck<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.110> idea<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:38.040> much

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
truck and kind of get an idea how much

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.030 
truck and kind of get an idea how much
it<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.460> dampens<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.210> affects<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> ride

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
it actually dampens and affects the ride

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
it actually dampens and affects the ride
but<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> throw<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.420> thing<00:01:42.479> around

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but now now to throw this thing around

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
but now now to throw this thing around
so<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> camera<00:01:44.549> pick

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so I'm not sure how much the camera pick

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.940 
so I'm not sure how much the camera pick
up<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> sound<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.750> mean<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.770> just

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
up all the sound but I mean this just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
up all the sound but I mean this just
sounds<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:49.229> sounds<00:01:49.560> amazing<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.240> ya

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
sounds it sounds amazing what we want ya

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.389 
sounds it sounds amazing what we want ya
know<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.799> few<00:01:53.070> where<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.310> actually

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
know I want to get few where we actually

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
know I want to get few where we actually
just<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> camera<00:01:54.090> close<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> can

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just get the camera close and you can

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.030 
just get the camera close and you can
hear<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:57.740> how<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.979> writing<00:01:59.990> absolutely

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
hear it how is that writing absolutely

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.180 
hear it how is that writing absolutely
extraordinary<00:02:05.840> alright<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.979> thing

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
extraordinary alright so the thing

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
extraordinary alright so the thing
that's<00:02:08.220> incredible<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.300> whole<00:02:09.479> setup

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's incredible about this whole setup

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.589 
that's incredible about this whole setup
is<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.250> ride<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.330> ultimately

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
is the ride because that's ultimately

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.820 
is the ride because that's ultimately
what<00:02:13.230> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
what this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.500 
what this
is<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.350> one<00:02:16.590> thing<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.160> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
is all about and the one thing that this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.770 
is all about and the one thing that this
really<00:02:18.510> blows<00:02:18.960> my<00:02:19.230> mind<00:02:19.500> about<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.360> delay

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
really blows my mind about is the delay

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.120 
really blows my mind about is the delay
that<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.470> actually<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:25.110> over<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
that you actually get as you go over the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.450 
that you actually get as you go over the
bumps<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> why<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.800> describe<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
bumps so why do you describe it as a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.070 
bumps so why do you describe it as a
delay<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.850> bump<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.420> you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
delay because you see the bump and you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.590 
delay because you see the bump and you
feel<00:02:35.510> well<00:02:36.510> okay<00:02:36.950> go<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.520> call<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
feel well okay go back I call it the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.560 
feel well okay go back I call it the
delay<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:41.220> happen<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.730> happens<00:02:42.270> here

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
delay because you happen it happens here

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.050 
delay because you happen it happens here
but<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.230> felt<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.740> back<00:02:43.920> there<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.940> other

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
but it you felt it back there the other

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.120 
but it you felt it back there the other
thing<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.480> incredible<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
thing that's really incredible is the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.010 
thing that's really incredible is the
resonance<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.060> coming<00:02:48.450> off<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.780> board

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
resonance that's coming off the board

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.980 
resonance that's coming off the board
the<00:02:49.710> only<00:02:50.070> noise<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.060> actually<00:02:51.240> hear

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
the only noise that you actually hear

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.710 
the only noise that you actually hear
when<00:02:52.470> you're<00:02:52.590> riding<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.160> thing<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
when you're riding this thing is the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.290 
when you're riding this thing is the
sound<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.680> wheels<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> bearings<00:02:57.060> as

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
sound of the wheels and the bearings as

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.140 
sound of the wheels and the bearings as
you're<00:02:57.630> riding<00:02:57.990> along<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.790> board<00:03:00.030> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you're riding along so this board is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.330 
you're riding along so this board is
super<00:03:00.540> quiet<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.680> got<00:03:01.830> nothing<00:03:02.190> but

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
super quiet it's got nothing but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.600 
super quiet it's got nothing but
urethane<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:04.230> isolating<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> motion

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
urethane that that isolating the motion

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.330 
urethane that that isolating the motion
of<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> axle<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:07.500> got<00:03:07.650> super<00:03:07.920> fat

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
of the axle and it's got super fat

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:22.190 
of the axle and it's got super fat
wheels<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.030> roll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:48.200 

bring<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.290> by<00:03:23.440> me

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.750 

so<00:03:49.210> we're<00:03:49.360> super<00:03:49.540> stoked<00:03:50.050> about<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.760> radical

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
so we're super stoked about this radical

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.600 
so we're super stoked about this radical
new<00:03:51.790> design<00:03:51.970> because<00:03:52.960> we<00:03:53.140> now<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.040> axle

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
new design because we now have the axle

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.170 
new design because we now have the axle
completely<00:03:55.330> floating<00:03:55.720> in<00:03:55.930> urethane<00:03:56.470> which<00:03:56.980> is

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
completely floating in urethane which is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.850 
completely floating in urethane which is
drastically<00:03:58.180> gonna<00:03:58.480> increase<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.650> ride

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
drastically gonna increase the ride

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.010 
drastically gonna increase the ride
quality<00:04:00.240> it's<00:04:01.240> gonna<00:04:01.330> create<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.750> whole<00:04:01.960> new

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
quality it's gonna create a whole new

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.280 
quality it's gonna create a whole new
world<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.910> tolerances<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.270> design<00:04:04.720> options

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
world of tolerances and design options

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.010 
world of tolerances and design options
that<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.800> now<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.280> if<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.210> guys<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.810> what
