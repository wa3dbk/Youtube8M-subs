00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
saw it in Confederacy honest I was if

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
saw it in Confederacy honest I was if
they<00:01:54.630> start<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:55.920> very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
they start well is going to be very very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.389 
they start well is going to be very very
difficult<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.600> other<00:01:58.170> teams<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> think

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
difficult for the other teams I think

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.740 
difficult for the other teams I think
German<00:02:00.140> after<00:02:01.140> 2006<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.130> made<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
German after 2006 they made the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.969 
German after 2006 they made the
renovation<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> national<00:02:04.560> team<00:02:04.740> with

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
renovation or the national team with

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.649 
renovation or the national team with
youngest<00:02:05.430> players<00:02:06.560> very

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
youngest players very

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.240 
youngest players very
good<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:10.650> Argentina<00:02:11.650> was<00:02:11.739> more<00:02:12.190> or

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
good and I think Argentina was more or

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
good and I think Argentina was more or
less<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.519> same<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.420> lot<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.780> new<00:02:14.019> players

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
less the same is a lot of new players

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.339 
less the same is a lot of new players
and<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.819> countries<00:02:16.299> for<00:02:17.049> me<00:02:17.200> our

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
and that kind of countries for me our

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.860 
and that kind of countries for me our
favorites<00:02:17.769> because<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.629> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
favorites because they have the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.680 
favorites because they have the
experience<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.739> play<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:21.910> high<00:02:22.120> level<00:02:22.540> they

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
have the experience to to achieve always

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.720

semifinals and finals of the world cup

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.229 
semifinals and finals of the world cup
messy<00:02:28.540> i<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:30.780> either<00:02:31.780> if<00:02:32.049> he's<00:02:32.170> not

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
messy i think is either if he's not

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.630
