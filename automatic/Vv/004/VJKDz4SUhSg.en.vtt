azumarill<00:02:43.290> gets<00:02:43.590> bubble<00:02:44.010> beam<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.430> 20

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
azumarill gets bubble beam on 20

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.720 
azumarill gets bubble beam on 20
I<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.870> was<00:02:45.990> Merrill<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.620> level<00:02:47.250> 20<00:02:47.580> not

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
I think that was Merrill on level 20 not

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.940 
I think that was Merrill on level 20 not
azumarill<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> grow<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> Zoomer<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
azumarill but because I grow a Zoomer to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.010 
azumarill but because I grow a Zoomer to
level<00:02:50.220> 23<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.390> still<00:02:51.600> haven't<00:02:51.840> gotten

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
level 23 and I still haven't gotten

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.140 
level 23 and I still haven't gotten
bubble<00:02:52.320> beam<00:02:52.470> by<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.770> end<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.220> video<00:02:53.610> but

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
bubble beam by the end of this video but

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.630 
bubble beam by the end of this video but
I<00:02:54.210> think<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.660> 24<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.290> if<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.470> 24<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.250> F<00:02:56.400> my

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
I think it's 24 so if it's 24 just F my

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.840 
I think it's 24 so if it's 24 just F my
FF<00:02:57.120> ml<00:02:57.570> because<00:02:58.320> like<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.280> know<00:02:59.550> that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
