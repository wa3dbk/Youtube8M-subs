00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.109
 when 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.900
 homo 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 Oh 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 Oh 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.850
 for this dream color it is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.340
 obvious that a slower tempo and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.840
 wished elsewhere in this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.410
 variation the primary difficulty and the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.290
 crossing of the hand of the left hand 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:33.210
 to the treble and we can not achieve 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.550
 this variation in an equal manner 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 balance is very calm that with a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.869
 very calm tempo so if you look 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 well the left hand score 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.690
 we have a crooked and nothing else he 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 does not indicate silence and it is a 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.560
 very discreet way 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.590
 he makes a point of telling us that there is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.380
 will have a pedal a permanent vibration 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.250
 during measurement so the use of the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.250
 right pedal 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:20.900
 the right hand in pyramidal bridge the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.900
 sixteenth notes will be played detached 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.519
 but with the use of a discrete pedal 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.660
 all this will be embedded in a color 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.660
 sweetness and tenderness 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.510
 hand work together in agreement 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.550
 in order to achieve the displacement of the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.610
 left hand very quickly with 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.970
 accuracy by singing well the thirds 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.970
 superior 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.730
 I redo 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580
 e 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.349
 not 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.970
 good 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.610
 in the upper dairy crossing 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.020
 you will make a small light breakfast 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.020
 crescendo and diminuendo 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.420
 then the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.490
 and the 6 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.980
 must be shine darf the brilliants 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.540
 of a diamond or a ray of sunshine on 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.640
 morning on your face as soon as you wake up 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.069
 for that you have to make a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.069
 flicking on the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.350
 but you must not play 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.350
 like this 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.609
 no 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.270
 so 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.480
 I start again you must think the bass 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.810
 the hand moves very quickly the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.460
 pedal holds the full extent of the doubles 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.460
 eighths are detached 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.660
 and the dairy cross are hyper 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.660
 cakes with a small hook no 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.830
 the little one and the diamond 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.830
 good 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.539
 good 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.160
 the beauty of this variation via 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.440
 contrasts tomorrow right hand very 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.600
 equals detached and left hand after 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580
 having laid the base well must play the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.320
 more cakes possible all this 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.600
 coated with pedal should give a 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.600
 impression of ecstasy so beautiful work
