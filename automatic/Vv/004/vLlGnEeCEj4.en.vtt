00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.410
 Companies in the southern part of the Randstad have put down the demand 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.220
 employers' organization vno ncw asked for more flights from london from 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.499
 the direction of the number of destinations that we want is to promote 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.009
 destination to berlin among them is a very important economic metropolis 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.099
 in europe then we should be able to go easily 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.899
 they want with Scandinavian countries they want more because the game 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.829
 Eastern Europe 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.549
 about ten destinations should actually be added where very 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:33.720
 makes clear 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 despite ten to twelve new destinations from Rotterdam the hague 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.890
 airport 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.070
 extension of the airport itself is not necessary 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950
 the management of the airport 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.860
 this is very clearly stated when ten or fifteen destinations are added 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.050
 it is a hard drive with a runway capacity 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 tromp from eindhoven van 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.920
 evening flights I don't know 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.870
 that should ask the door pep talk but this is of course clear that via 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 companies that want flexibility 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 in air traffic 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 you cannot work everything between 8 and 5 abnormally when planning 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.119
 so that's different 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.320
 ships must be 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.290
 that residents of the airport are not waiting for more air traffic what 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 from venlo in syria 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.820
 I don't think people around here object to destinations 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.260
 i think people 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.390
 the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.110
 a problem lies with a problem with possible nuisance and that must be 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.350
 the logistical and ready distribution over day and night 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.050
 very well arranged 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.490
 among the residents of rotterdam there are ideas about it 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 with its form of stress and depression 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.880
 from london 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 and and avoiding the inconvenience 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.570
 local noise pollution falls 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 and that means that we are nothing against business flights 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.010
 but say yes then it must be a balance 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.240
 it is therefore a matter of switching if they are more business flights 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.010
 then there must be 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.940
 fewer holiday flights 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.710
 and what we would really like is that no more flights took place during the weekend 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 is becoming 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.850
 if there is more business flight element 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.650
 have come during the week 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.249
 then they could trade it out 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.459
 fewer flights on the weekend
