00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello we are today with 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 the top ten tuesday of the week in the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.010
 theme and the delusions you would like 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 see adapted to the cinema 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.430
 finally in strings in TV series I 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 a little cheat because I have not 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.500
 found ten so I have that May 6 are 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.150
 books that I would really like 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 much can adapt to the cinema so 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 I told myself I'll do it when 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 even 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.199
 the first book that sprouted see adapted 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.969
 in the cinema maybe you doubt it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.760
 I do not know but it would be 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 this one but 84 tabucchi murakami 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.290
 simply because I find 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 the extraordinary story really out 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.260
 the common one that really deserves to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840
 terrain you can really do a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 nice movie on it 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.050
 now I'm not sure it's 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 make a day maybe adaptation 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 Japanese by the way preferred a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 Japanese adaptation do not know too much 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 what and here are some 95 1 4084 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 so I think it would be a good 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.680
 friend movie that brother of the movie the second 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.900
 I do not know if I can really 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 put in but I still put 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 that's where it is it's so sticky wide and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270
 the first volume the yellow eyes of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 crocodiles 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 why can not I really be 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.189
 simply because a movie that goes 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 go out that goes out in april 2014 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.729
 I really very very very very very very 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 can not wait to see what it's all about 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.640
 that there is no bruel patrick in there so I 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 you explain I have a little I'm a little 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.220
 bompard fans of patrick bauwen but 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 I really like being an actor and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.119
 singer he exudes a lot of charm 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 and suddenly I find he will play 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.049
 philippe and I find it really sticks 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.759
 well to the character I think it's okay 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.500
 really good to bruel patrick and to 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.530
 philippe inversely and all that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.820
 proportional sailboats but you very 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.100
 happy that it is he who has the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 role of philippe wise imagine 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.970
 totally a man like that when I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.420
 think when I imagined philippe in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 my head 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.909
 so here is the third book that would do 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.610
 I think an excellent film is 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.890
 many the attacker replied that would do 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
 a thunder god movie because 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.260
 the intrigued and I 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.810
 helisim the story is at the top an action 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.550
 huge and especially the fantastic that the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 facts are a little fantastic but not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.910
 too much is perfect then the story 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 of love is super cute so ya all 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.610
 the elements all it takes for 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.120
 make a good movie the character 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.160
 principal and is fine and he is 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.650
 very deep there is really what 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.810
 exploit and finally short I can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 that would be a great movie that's 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.230
 true that a lot of adaptations stephen 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.010
 king so maybe one day they 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.930
 will fit this one who knows fourth 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.110
 he whom I would like to have adapted in film 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 this 1 half sauce and the daughter of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.310
 paper it's my favorite the jump of all 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.810
 the times I've had them all except the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.270
 very last one called tomorrow if I 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.950
 do not fool me and I'm a little easy 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.300
 and higher because these 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.340
 finally I find it is repeated it's 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.610
 always the intrigues always the same 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.100
 thing so inevitably it tired me 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.270
 but this one I could rent without faith 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 simply from this trouble story 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.670
 super beautiful super original and I think 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.239
 so also that it's a very very 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.540
 good movie it could be a beautiful movie 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.420
 and so that's the bus paper girl 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.920
 or those who like to come I would like 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.209
 see adapted to the cinema it's this one 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.680
 so that's the part of eric's other 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.620
 emmanuel schmitt it's a book in 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.360
 braille ticker other little parenthesis 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.310
 I really like where everything if all 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.739
 movie books that revolves around the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.120
 World War II inevitably I 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.350
 loved this one is so for you 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.000
 briefly explain if you know 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.790
 not actually so ruins the story is 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.780
 cut into two once a where to 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.800
 the story as we know it is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.570
 to say what happened when hitler 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.670
 has not been accepted to the fine arts and 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.920
 when it became clear is 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.450
 knows in school Egypt and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.740
 water is what would have happened if 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.300
 had just been accepted 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.520
 fine arts and I think it's great 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.680
 super super interesting I really 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.960
 loved this book it's hard there are some 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.240
 passages really hard but it was 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.000
 a good read and my grandmother has 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.170
 he too is there to double over or 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.090
 less known the second world war 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.700
 she was small at that time so 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.540
 well I recommend it was it was 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.830
 less well and the last book the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.290
 sixth I would love to see 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.150
 adapted to the cinema 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.530
 he's a guy or afraid of favorites 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.090
 of summer it's David's memories 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.330
 foenkinos wade who do not dare I say 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.070
 still not how it is pronounced 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.270
 and why it will be a good kit all 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.550
 simply because it would be great 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.580
 touching it would not be the film of the century 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.080
 it would not be the movie to see but I 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.220
 think me I 'll be the kind of movie 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.810
 I could love because I love 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.650
 many simple stories like that 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.360
 who can move you 13 very 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.620
 easily I think it would be the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.040
 kind of title in which I cried 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.750
 cry not less to live so that's it 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.800
 is a movie enough names so I think 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.650
 here it was a thing you are super top 10 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.620
 is super fast I know but already I'm 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.040
 am rushed because after I have to 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.400
 drive misery and then if 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.720
 you do not eat the 10 pounds me ya ya 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.440
 not a lot of living that would be good in 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.460
 movie that would be better end of my opinion 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.960
 the books are always better than the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.370
 movies the series that there is something 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.680
 story that really deserves to be 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.900
 adapted and that they would be very good 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.820
 for in film and there are also a lot 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.530
 that I would have liked to see that they are already 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.970
 adapted but in versions are 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.360
 old and so suddenly it does not relax 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.280
 too much because he was going to the hard nine years 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.100
 has been adapted many times even I 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.720
 think that if she was adapted official 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.730
 of if I told myself that's very good 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.090
 but I think it was adapted to the 6 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.290
 may 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.630
 never seen this movie maybe I 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.930
 may meet me a great lord 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:17.720
 players and to see that finally brief it's 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.720
 all for this top ten tuesday the same
