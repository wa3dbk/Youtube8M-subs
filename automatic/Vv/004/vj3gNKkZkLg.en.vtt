 this video so they can be more 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.019
 pending what the news is 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.670
 when it 's a video there I 'm always going to 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.670
 be talking about what can be 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.909
 happening things like that nothing more than nothing 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.800
 it is information that can not be done in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.840
 a video and I thank you very much 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.020
 thank you very much thank you very much 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.049
 for the 200 subscribers 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
 let's go into what is the video as 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.409
 knows 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 the six will be launched of the day 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.439
 depending on what now comes out in your 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.619
 country is obviously that they are going to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.619
 to have 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 how fast are they going to have their 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.120
 device with ios 6 and I give them like 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.130
 recommendation I tell them not to 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.840
 update your device because if you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 they update they are going to lose the fact of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.300
 be able to have an untethered jailbreak in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.310
 5.1.1 as you know if you update 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.440
 to lose that boils and still is not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 of grass understand for what are the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.060
 new devices and devices 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.160
 old software so like 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.650
 recommendation, I tell them not to update 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.090
 your device at 6 until there is no 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 a jailbreak and obviously here in the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.830
 channel we are going to make to show this video 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 how to do it 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.140
 Another news that I also have is 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.990
 that if you get to update without 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.700
 want your device or by mistake or 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.310
 simply because they want to try the I 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.270
 6 what they can do to get back 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.930
 then to ios 5.1.1 it is downloaded from 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 this page what is it has a flies that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.240
 It is a program that helps us 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.180
 download it 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.370
 that is to keep what are the shhh 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.240
 our device you will ask 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.380
 what are the s hs h2s hs hs is a signature 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.270
 digital that makes you notice that our 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.880
 device was in the bios 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.850
 corresponding to s hs for example in 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.860
 my device was in ios 5.1.1 is going 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.560
 save the htc hd and 151 5.1.1 and with 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.390
 this ssh that we have saved we can 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.190
 do it that is a finger point with a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.270
 program that I also obviously go 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 to teach him to do 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.850
 here on the channel in another separate video with 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.980
 that we can go back to them 5.1.1 two of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.170
 them six because as you know no 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 we can do a downgrade with itunes 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.730
 but with this device and more the shhh 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.440
 we can go back to that version 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.150
 as you can see here we have to 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.440
 access the page obviously the link 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'm going to leave it on the page 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.819
 description and in this section you 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 they have to download the team umbrella if 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.440
 they are in mac or windows depending on 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.530
 you and once you download this 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 program will show you the program here 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.680
 and as you can see here the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.280
 devices that are connected in this 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.629
 case I have commented what is my ipod 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.299
 as you can see here we get the version 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.459
 in which we were and other specific 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.290
 of our device and what we should 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.849
 doing is a very simple step what 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.209
 we must do is here and now squeeze 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.160
 where it says 6 shh and once what 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.200
 we learn will start running this bar 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.930
 green and it will start saving in this 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.060
 section what the shh are like they can 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.650
 see my device was at 25 points 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.790
 0.1 and me 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.709
 and 5.1 5.1.1 and with these signatures that 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.819
 they obviously keep in a folder that 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.790
 we will decide 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.190
 now by default with these files is 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.670
 that we can return to a 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.790
 old version of ios 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.740
 if you want to keep your cessation hs h 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.630
 in a folder other than that of 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.850
 defect they have to go draw this 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.470
 advanced index section and here 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.600
 select the folder where they want 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.090
 save in my case and save it in a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 own folder but you can 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.310
 keep it where you want and nothing 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.320
 as you can see in this video is 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.850
 quite short but very important the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.260
 That's why I bring them to you. 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.780
 work in the channel because now that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.180
 it came out 6 will start to see many 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.340
 news with what they are serves with 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.060
 you see for the 6 like you 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.800
 you know there is already a henry but this ter and 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.620
 more over only works with the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.280
 devices to 4 that would be the iphone 4 or 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.590
 iphone 4 and iphone 3gs 26 runs 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.220
 for devices from the iphone 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.460
 3gs up to iphone 5 from iphone 4 up 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.430
 the iphone 5 and the ipad 2 up to the 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.160
 ipad as well as you can see there are many 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.640
 new devices like the a6 that would be 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.380
 the iphone 5 in the 5 that would be the ipad or 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.230
 the iphone 5 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.300
 to 5 x what would be spa 3 so the 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.340
 true the new jailbreak for the 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.290
 developers and the hackers that do 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.180
 this herb was going to be quite difficult and 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.950
 a quite long task like you 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.990
 you know I'm always going to bring trailers 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.080
 the news of what jailbreak is 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.780
 untethered on this channel and nothing so 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.190
 it is not enough for us to wait and go and help 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.770
 the developers when they finish their 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.500
 tool and nothing I say goodbye with this 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.310
 video I hope you liked it if you 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.380
 it served like 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.330
 you want to tell something comment something 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.950
