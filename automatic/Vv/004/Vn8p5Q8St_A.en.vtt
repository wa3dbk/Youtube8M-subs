00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to you about sega glutcher and in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.970
 Today's video, I will tell you how 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 get to the closed location 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.429
 most likely it will be the location of the future 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 some action related to gone and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 house of fools which will be released in may 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.630
 This year, many experts say that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.640
 In this location not on Venus could be 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.140
 get there before but after last 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.500
 patch that came out literally weeks 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 backwards 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 This location has changed a lot. 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 I have become more traced to me no more 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 detailed and so on so 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 let's finally get into this 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.500
 location for this you have to play on 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.059
 Venus can do it on a patrol 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.030
 select the q patrol and go to the location 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.579
 run through the citadel in the citadel location 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 these are all x minotaurs and others 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.770
 attributes as I do and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 get to the location from the portal here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.270
 this portal will be here too 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.730
 be present at x and you extinguish everyone 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 and after you figure it out 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 Fixed you left the number of locations with 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.250
 the portal we see this portal is working 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 but it is closed by an energy shield and in order 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 to get him we have to choose 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 either warlock or titans what they have 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 such powerful jumps for this we go to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 the left side of this location and jump 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 first here on this rail further we 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 let's jump on this iron 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.560
 constructions we see on calm 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 hold back we have to jump here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.650
 on this iron rail jumping after 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 this begins more complex such 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 moments 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.100
 then we have to jump on this one 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.009
 iron construction 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.869
 in that tone, I still did it further 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.369
 jump again to the next version 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.320
 do iron construction like this 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.140
 sides we fly it and find ourselves on 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.790
 very top now our task is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.670
 just get to this place 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.799
 I'm making a gun for now 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 of this we go to the very edge of the spire gate or 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.780
 Here is this iron rail 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.570
 and as soon as we got to the very edge 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.670
 repelled did a long jump and fly 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.369
 in the direction of this portal upwards we will see 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.440
 we calmly fly this inner 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.440
 energy bill on this bills and get into 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.830
 portal and us the portal carries up in so 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.660
 called location terminus we fall into 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 this location is terminus and see what it is 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.560
 pretty nicely detailed 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.840
 most likely it will be some again 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 I will repeat here some 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 events soon it may be 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.290
 strike because 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.959
 Raid told banks that they will add us 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.739
 but nonetheless we can guess 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.209
 just guess what will happen in the future but 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.519
 yet it can be 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.100
 not bad so learn and even here 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.989
 you get here you will find here 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.000
 whose dead guest you can 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.760
 resurrect and also Russian then what 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.769
 this location has two more dead 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.720
 guest there are three guests here 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.329
 about this if you liked my video i 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.310
 I will tell in my next video that is 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.709
 how to get to those other two 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.510
 Gostov and also want you to draw your 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.820
 attention to the fact that these are all locations 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.650
 which you see all these platforms and not 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.870
 tangible that is, they can jump 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.019
 maybe not at all but on most of 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.269
 them you can even be down there 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.459
 a lot of space that is just like you 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.200
 fall what they get here in 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.890
 distances between these platform there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.959
 there is still 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.670
 platforms below and so on that is it 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.280
 pretty since I repeat again 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 worked out location for future 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.310
 strikes and other missions, and so on it 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.720
 actually I have it all if you 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.670
