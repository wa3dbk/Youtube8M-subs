00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.420
 Hello friends, you often write 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.670
 me nice comments especially in 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.680
 instagram about my style 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.840
 how I dress now and even how I 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.000
 looked when she was plump 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.490
 but not all of my 105 kilos are somewhere in 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.680
 in the middle of losing weight, I basically 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.380
 clothes even hid all their 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.110
 problem areas I decided that why 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.029
 We do not discuss this topic and youtube and not 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.860
 make some advice for those who 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.140
 of course wants to look better in 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.090
 future who work on his body but 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.460
 at the same time, it can and should 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.559
 look great now any 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.420
 plump girl can correctly 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.760
 matched clothes and hide some 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.489
 its flaws until it over them 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.129
 works and general this video is for you and 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.320
 also helped me for days and mine 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.480
 girlfriend from america cafe same basket she 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.379
 stylist talented girl in general I her 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.359
 I adore I think I advise her along with 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.250
 my feed will help you 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.780
 By the way, she has a blog, I need to leave 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.659
 you link in the description I think that you 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.130
 also love how I loved her 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.200
 so let's get started how 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.490
 dress full girls and first 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 a question which we will discuss today 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.190
 can you choose the right clothes 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.260
 hide 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.480
 few extra pounds like this 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.360
 do and what things and one hundred percent 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.280
 worth avoiding i x already believe that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.220
 really clothes can be removed extra 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.260
 kilos but of course not 20 will not 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 all the same here we will dream 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.980
 realists are about 5 kilograms quite 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.170
 you can clean yourself properly selected 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.710
 way about what it costs 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.350
 to avoid 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.910
 Well, of course in many respects everything is individual 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.730
 because we have a different body structure 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.260
 and different problem areas but still 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.590
 there are some recommendations 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.570
 it is for example logical mini skirts short 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.210
 tops short pants capri jackets different 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.070
 jackets that make you not volume 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.100
 and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 definitely too tight things on 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.180
 plump girls often you don't look 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.600
 very good because our main task 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.580
 this clothes pull your silhouette to you 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.250
 seemed taller and at the same time 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.170
 slim and all these things are more likely to do 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 you are shorter and add extra 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.100
 kilos and the next question 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.959
 Does the basic wardrobe differ? 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.480
 base girl wardrobe full 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.070
 girls generally basic wardrobe is 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 such an individual thing 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.020
 because it depends directly on the person 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.450
 because if you work in an office then 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.890
 it is logical that your basic wardrobe is 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.959
 one story and if you are free 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.730
 artists in general can wear all that 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.160
 your head comes and try different 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.580
 images are much more likely than office workers 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.040
 so itâ€™s not all about 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.640
 your even physique from the specifics of your 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.260
 work 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.940
 lifestyles and of course and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.590
 climatic conditions and already 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.170
 directly from what you have 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
 build where the problem areas then you 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.400
 start from what will be 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 prevail in your wardrobe and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 and make a girl nink at the plump 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.310
 may be the same things one and the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.980
 same t-shirt but just a different cut for 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.540
 so that she perfectly sat down and hid 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 some flaws in plump 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.709
 for example, what things should be attributed to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.590
 always in the wardrobe of the girl with 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.600
 luxuriant and in the first place my 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.510
 overseers favorite coat i do them 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.310
 I adore despite the fact that I lost weight to me 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.519
 they are comfortable and it seems to me that this 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.970
 volume he can someone hide someone 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.100
 to embellish and in general it is very cozy 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.840
 next we have pants, it is desirable that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.890
 they were long with a high 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.400
 skirt- fit too 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.980
 middle length 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480
 comfortable shoes with a steady heel 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.340
 so that heel was at least some 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 greatly increases your growth and you will 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.799
 look much more attractive 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.200
 I think the legs are stretched and this is any 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.989
 girls do not interfere it seems to me and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.910
 probably worth mentioning to you such 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.900
 long men's shirts or white 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.459
 t-shirts that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.640
 Looks awesome with some beautiful 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.710
 blaze frame or some jackets 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.140
 rockets but the main thing that they were 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.360
 correctly selected and probably all 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.800
 these things can be attributed to any wardrobe 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.840
 girls because they are practically 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120
 universal and the fact that the fashion comes to 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.950
 bulky stuff it is also very cool it 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.590
 gives many opportunities to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.660
 experiment with style and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.130
 really choose what you want 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.340
 fits perfect and hide some 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.440
 disadvantages the next topic is bright 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.540
 colors because we all know what is black 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.550
 slim it means that for some 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.040
 girls should avoid bright colors and 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.050
 in fact, it is not important to understand that 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.450
 bright color somehow attracts you 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.250
 attention so you need to think where are you 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.180
 want this attention to get in your 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.070
 wardrobe 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.860
 you can choose for example bright 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.210
 accessories bags and shoes and not 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.400
 always wear black 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.380
 because there are a bunch of things for example even 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.290
 dark shades there is a beautiful deep 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.780
 blue or some red 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.360
 more wine is also dark colors 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 who can visually make you 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.730
 slimmer 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.980
 but that doesn't mean you have to go 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.930
 all blacks just like you just liters 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.850
 the next question we discuss is 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.320
 how to choose the perfect jeans because it 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.600
 really one of the most popular 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.190
 clothing in our wardrobe at 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.680
 wardrobe seems to me at all any 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.150
 man perfect jeans pick up 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.460
 not easy and it knows not only 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.880
 plump girls even slim because 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.250
 what 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.410
 To jeans village sometimes have to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.210
 generally bypass half shopping 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.180
 complex to measure hundreds of options 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.430
 here, specifically, gender advice 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.620
 girls of course avoid super 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.229
 shine gloss rhinestones and so on 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.000
 because this effect will 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.979
 on the contrary it creates the opposite 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.890
 extra volume is perfect 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.470
 any dark blue jeans 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.050
 beautiful coal black dark gray 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.300
 which on the contrary will make your legs and well 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.570
 let's say more attractive also 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.190
 quite healthy can look 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.590
 popular now boyfriends with long 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.210
 riding if you're a short girl 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.789
 then of course you better choose 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.590
 classic jeans either you can take 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.930
 slightly narrowed but with a high landing 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.430
 and if a girl is tall then you have 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.410
 options are so much more you can 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.180
 try almost everything and even flush 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.870
 which by the way is pretty 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.450
 only the main thing is popular 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.250
 so that your hips are not very volumes 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.990
 then he just doesn't sit very well and 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.150
 then it is better to look towards the classics 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.880
 still the next question for you today 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.400
 last place to find clothes plus 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.830
 says size actually when i was 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.140
 full I can tell you that well when 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.210
 It was super full bought where it was 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.020
 let's say so then there were not so many 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.840
 of stores 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.490
 all sorts of shopping complexes and then when 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.380
 I already taught high school and looked 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.690
 less decent earned herself 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.240
 hope you could go to 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.550
 ordinary stores types than smoke or manga 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.710
 same zara and really me 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.000
 I could already pick up something for myself 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.240
 so gradually from Excel 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.990
 moved to cutting and well a long period 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.660
 time was in rbm and it doesn't matter even 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.550
 it was for the brand well, it is possible to 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.960
 It was found in any store you had to 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.520
 walk some special shops for 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.670
 thick where clothes 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.530
 usually looks very inconsistent 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.080
 let's say it and I certainly not 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.140
 like it so you have to accentuate 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.900
 attention to probably ordinary 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.630
 stores where there is just wide 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.350
 size range and plus see what is in 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.990
 your city 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:29.110
 although now in our time you can order 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.390
 almost everything on the internet is why i 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.010
 it seems very cool that full 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.390
 girls can now dress 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.690
 modern not to experience any 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.580
 discomfort such as it was before 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.620
 the times of my youth wanted to say about 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.630
 polina of mine we will say so very plump 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.400
 childhood then stores so much 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.960
 absolutely was not well that's all on 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.240
 Today I hope that this video will be
