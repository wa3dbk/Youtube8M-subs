00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 new video guys today we're here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.869
 this new video on a new game for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 a new series liked we are in the game 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.769
 called closes today 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 this game is a we can say one 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 very nice platformer that left me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 without words and that I decided to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.760
 record the simple reason why me 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 loved it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 today they are also in this new location 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 called randon games 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 tonight the boys will record immediately 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 and not me I never recorded and games 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 that I would like to do a strong mason series 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 so i make these gameplay weight in 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 this series tell me if you like them or 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.420
 no based on the answers of the regi 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.379
 stroman the fairies then I show the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.590
 game to introduce some there are many 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 but I can say that the difficulty a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 one and I was saying increases will increase to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 maximum levels then chlorine levels 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210
 so 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.720
 which then we do not know why this thing 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 makes you fly farther than the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 others but mysteries of the day seems 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:33.509
 something else 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:41.579
 there do not know but never mind her hands 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:43.470
 hands have disappeared or I thought it was 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.850
 simpler aimed at but instead is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.850
 a thousand times more than visible 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:10.500
 relationship back there like heck there 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 will be four the boys came 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 a fantastic private idea maybe it wasn't 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.560
 that is the methodology 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 right spirit maybe I have to do so 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.750
 that does not stop 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.340
 but by doing so I say the ball is fine 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.049
 in space move it real saying 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.549
 I push ok, from that I did it 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.690
 or buy another sector then 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.550
 guys that I can say I hope that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.130

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.080

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.090
 in the description and that I can tell you 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.810
 another key date is not everything 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.530
 hello to all that hands do not appear 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.530
