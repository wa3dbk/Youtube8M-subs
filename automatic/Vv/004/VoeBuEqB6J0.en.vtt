i'm going to show you guys I found his

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
i'm going to show you guys I found his
own<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.619> amazingly<00:01:59.340> complicated<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
own right it's amazingly complicated and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
own right it's amazingly complicated and
I<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.960> no<00:02:01.200> idea<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> works<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.460> I'm

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
I have no idea how it works but I'm

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.200 
I have no idea how it works but I'm
going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> try<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> explain<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.320> anyway<00:02:05.210> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
going to try and explain it anyway so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.730 
going to try and explain it anyway so
what<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:06.450> thinking<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.439> have

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
what I'm thinking is that they have

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.660 
what I'm thinking is that they have
squid<00:02:08.599> right<00:02:09.599> these<00:02:09.899> squid<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.920> spawn<00:02:11.400> with

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
squid right these squid they spawn with

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
squid right these squid they spawn with
the<00:02:11.940> items<00:02:12.540> somehow<00:02:13.170> at

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the items somehow at

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.810 
the items somehow at
hatch<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:14.220> them<00:02:14.960> here<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:17.220> command

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
hatch to them here is the one command

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.780 
hatch to them here is the one command
block<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.480> spawns<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.370> fish<00:02:21.020> squid<00:02:22.610> see<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
block that spawns this fish squid see it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.400 
block that spawns this fish squid see it
summons<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.480> item<00:02:25.070> riding<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.190> squid<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> yeah

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
summons the item riding a squid so yeah

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.600 
summons the item riding a squid so yeah
basically<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.340> squid<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:30.090> invulnerable<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
basically the squid is invulnerable and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.900 
basically the squid is invulnerable and
he<00:02:33.030> has<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.510> item<00:02:34.020> riding<00:02:34.410> him<00:02:34.880> now<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
he has this item riding him now I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
he has this item riding him now I
believe<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.840> happening<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.260> here

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
believe that it's happening right here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.510 
believe that it's happening right here
as<00:02:37.980> well<00:02:38.570> if<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.960> can<00:02:40.110> somehow<00:02:40.350> get<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.430> way

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
as well if I can somehow get all the way

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.430 
as well if I can somehow get all the way
down<00:02:41.550> here<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.140> actually<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:45.350> which<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
down here if it's actually there which I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500 
down here if it's actually there which I
don't<00:02:46.500> think<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.970> think<00:02:48.390> this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
don't think it is and I don't think this

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.660 
don't think it is and I don't think this
is<00:02:48.570> actually<00:02:49.170> how<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.520> works<00:02:54.110> yeah<00:02:55.670> okay

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
is actually how this one works yeah okay

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.330 
is actually how this one works yeah okay
so<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.209> how<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.140> works<00:02:58.170> um<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
so it's not how this one works um I

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.310 
so it's not how this one works um I
thought<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.390> say<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> know<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> squid

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
thought it was just say you know a squid

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.230 
thought it was just say you know a squid
would<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.709> fish<00:03:02.190> attached<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> know

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
would have fish attached to it you know

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.449 
would have fish attached to it you know
from<00:03:03.570> miles<00:03:03.840> deep<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.790> does<00:03:06.090> not<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:08.040> is

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
from miles deep it does not this one is

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.240 
from miles deep it does not this one is
just<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.930> item<00:03:10.290> i<00:03:10.410> guess<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.100> has<00:03:11.220> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
just the item i guess but it has a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.350 
just the item i guess but it has a
duration<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:12.209> forever<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.700> yeah<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.910> can't

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
duration of forever so yeah you can't

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.720 
duration of forever so yeah you can't
pick<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.600> up<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.590> would<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.310> if<00:03:17.610> I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
pick it up and you would not see if I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.400 
pick it up and you would not see if I
just<00:03:17.940> ran<00:03:18.150> over<00:03:18.180> here<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.630> cannot<00:03:19.050> pick<00:03:19.290> these

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
just ran over here I cannot pick these

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.229 
just ran over here I cannot pick these
up<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.100> look<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:21.269> make<00:03:21.390> them<00:03:21.510> fly<00:03:21.750> flat

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
up the look I can make them fly flat

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.160 
up the look I can make them fly flat
they<00:03:24.239> are<00:03:24.420> squids<00:03:24.870> invisible<00:03:25.560> squid<00:03:25.920> oh<00:03:27.170> it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
they are squids invisible squid oh it's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.380 
they are squids invisible squid oh it's
going<00:03:28.350> through<00:03:28.709> step<00:03:29.040> by<00:03:29.070> step<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.820> fowls<00:03:30.060> done

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
going through step by step of fowls done

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.050 
going through step by step of fowls done
so<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.810> spawn<00:03:31.140> with<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> squid<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.890> them<00:03:32.060> squid

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
so they spawn with a squid on them squid

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.199 
so they spawn with a squid on them squid
becomes<00:03:33.360> invisible<00:03:34.340> squid<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.610> placed<00:03:35.970> in

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
becomes invisible squid is placed in

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.009 
becomes invisible squid is placed in
winter<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.750> they<00:03:36.780> swim<00:03:37.200> around<00:03:38.959> at<00:03:39.959> our

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
winter so they swim around at our

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.550 
winter so they swim around at our
barrier<00:03:40.530> oh<00:03:42.680> they<00:03:43.680> are<00:03:43.799> barrier<00:03:44.280> blocks

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
barrier oh they are barrier blocks

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.759 
barrier oh they are barrier blocks
