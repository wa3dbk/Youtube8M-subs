00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
tired I want to see these brightly

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.130 
tired I want to see these brightly
colored<00:02:06.140> headers<00:02:06.500> no<00:02:07.420> but<00:02:08.420> instead<00:02:08.840> there's<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
colored headers no but instead there's a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.530 
colored headers no but instead there's a
bunch<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.380> wires<00:02:09.619> okay<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.340> got<00:02:10.640> plugs<00:02:11.150> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
bunch of wires okay I got plugs and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.710 
bunch of wires okay I got plugs and
green<00:02:12.070> liquid<00:02:13.070> how<00:02:13.520> much<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.240> car<00:02:14.540> is

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
green liquid how much of this car is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.260 
green liquid how much of this car is

their<00:02:22.400> actual<00:02:22.660> 427<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.350> nearly

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
their actual 427 this is this one nearly

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.550 
their actual 427 this is this one nearly
as<00:02:25.310> fast<00:02:25.520> as<00:02:25.700> oh<00:02:25.820> gosh<00:02:26.390> yeah<00:02:26.750> actually<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.290> think

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
as fast as oh gosh yeah actually I think

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.840 
as fast as oh gosh yeah actually I think
it's<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:28.130> faster<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's a little bit faster in the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's a little bit faster in the
acceleration<00:02:29.510> since<00:02:30.020> most<00:02:30.380> like<00:02:30.680> electric

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
acceleration since most like electric

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.920 
acceleration since most like electric
cars<00:02:31.459> are<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:31.850> faster<00:02:32.270> off<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.450> line<00:02:32.720> than

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
cars are really faster off the line than

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.290 
cars are really faster off the line than
gas<00:02:33.110> cars<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:34.130> beautiful<00:02:34.730> outside<00:02:34.850> let's<00:02:35.209> go

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
gas cars it's beautiful outside let's go

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.130 
gas cars it's beautiful outside let's go
for<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> run<00:02:35.570> come<00:02:35.750> on

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
for a run come on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.380 
for a run come on
god<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.980> step<00:02:37.280> back<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.610> time<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
god it's like a step back in time and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.630 
god it's like a step back in time and
into<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> future<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.770> affectionate

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
into the future at the affectionate

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.670 
into the future at the affectionate
t-shirt<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.420> at<00:02:41.630> once<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.080> guess<00:02:42.230> that's<00:02:42.530> the

t-shirt all at once I guess that's the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:55.089 
t-shirt all at once I guess that's the
case<00:02:42.920> huh

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.730

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
have a thousand foot-pounds of torque

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
accelerations thing is very very fun to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.789 
accelerations thing is very very fun to
drive<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:24.230> kind<00:03:24.379> of<00:03:24.409> a<00:03:24.530> guiltless

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
drive and it's kind of a guiltless

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.110 
drive and it's kind of a guiltless
pleasure<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.370> because<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.790> course<00:03:25.940> we're<00:03:26.090> not

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
pleasure to because of course we're not

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.440 
pleasure to because of course we're not
burning<00:03:26.480> up<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.900> 4.30<00:03:27.890> cent<00:03:28.159> gas<00:03:28.450> exactly

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
burning up that 4.30 cent gas exactly

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.390 
burning up that 4.30 cent gas exactly
but<00:03:29.900> we're<00:03:30.049> burning<00:03:30.379> daylight<00:03:30.409> still<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.190> you

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
