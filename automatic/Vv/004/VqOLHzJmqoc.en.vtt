00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 I think you have the fight for wear 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 seen that both sides have operated 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 if you take the whole 90 minutes 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.830
 I think I can do that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.690
 undecided in order because corpus 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 has had more chances for us 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.930
 alex polo but I think so too 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.039
 has saved fantastic in two three 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.500
 Situations when you spot this 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 we were after the 1 0 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.980
 actually on a very good way that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 then it's hard to get back into the game 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.829
 back then we start unfortunately 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 this red card and i can give you that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.559
 not say I have of many 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 It is said that people do not belong 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 been red card 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.320
 I can not great too 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 position do not take pictures 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.039
 nothing but important is that one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.510
 midfield situation I do not have to 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.480
 go down then I stop that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.920
 he must learn colleague werner that he 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.570
 do not do these things 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 This is how a game comes back in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 another story we had just happened 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 well in the grip I think and must come 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.329
 Of course , this is again through this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 compensation 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.450
 also really fresh still has 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.830
 all times set and mine 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 team I have to praise then 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 not for the 11 caught because you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.250
 not allowed with ten man in one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.979
 We are allowed to run this situation 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 not happen but like it afterwards 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.479
 defended we have everything again 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.530
 given and on the other side my 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.900
 colleague will certainly be like that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 see both teams have a lot 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.060
 done in the last weeks and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 have again today until the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 in the end, and so hamburgs 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.509
 differently peaceful 1 1 separated 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.979
 Many Thanks 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.619
 norbert meier the colleague's shops 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.270
 stefan krämer peter sees something similar 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.659
 slight ball losses and thereby the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.159
 game very hectic did not have a good one 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.329
 good ball possession times that will be so 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.590
 after a quarter of an hour better 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.130
 I think then you have a very good one 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.689
 control and I think that was 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.009
 the colleague says about the whole 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.280
 seen significantly more chances 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.679
 had and also a bit more ins 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.679
 That's why I think we've invested a lot of money 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.909
 I have stressed that we under which a 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.140
 had deserved victory on the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.489
 on the other side, if you speak against it, 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.069
 a good team like samina normal 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.599
 is a train back then you can 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.329
 Of course, be forth after when you are 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.040
 you still 11 game it is so yes the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.690
 medal somehow has two sides 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.579
 On the other hand, I'm totally at 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 norbert meier 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.269
 the teams are heavily burdened by the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.079
 players have become full again 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.209
 reingehauen 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.200
 I think that's the mileage 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.000
 if you have the morning on the table 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.650
 you will be very happy with that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.329
 can be at the end of such a 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.760
 from such a phase where a lot of games 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.170
 in a short time, I think so 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.410
 that we have a good time on the audience 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.859
 intense in the third league match on high 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.660
 level and underlined 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.310
 I also think that both teams 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.609
 with the point so first we have to 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.959
 but we can live with it thanks to the 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.489
 thank you very much stefan krämer is now like 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.349
 always ask the possibility to ask 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.579
 please have a short hand signal we have 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.579
 a microphone and need who wants 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.250
 everyone still write times to see if anyone 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.260
 would like to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.090
 it does not look that way right now 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.489
 I thank you for the constant 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.810
 bielefelder good home trip to the guests 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.980
 we still need a pleasant rest 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.980
 sunday until next time
