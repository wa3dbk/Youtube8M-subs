00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 Hello 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.000
 this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.480
 make puddle and teeth are going to see how 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 it is done it is not necessary that it be meat of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 call or have to be carla 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 meat in several days with salt so that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.669
 be hard but give them to teach a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.680
 easiest way to do it and now I should 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.350
 apologize because I wanted to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.690
 teach everything from the beginning but 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.570
 unfortunately I woke up late my 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.870
 mom had already done much of the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.409
 I work so I advise you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 use any type of meat 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.940
 obviously that is not any chop 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.370
 type of meat not necessarily flame 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 because the original dish is with fighting 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.109
 with llama meat and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.749
 a very easy way and very burn 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.800
 any type of meat that we have and 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.620
 we are going to put it 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.210
 of water like half of the pot or 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.880
 a little more and we're going to put salt 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.630
 enough salt let's put onions 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 carrot and let's put the meat the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.230
 I have known the meat, appointment for an hour and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 half or one hour 45 is how they stay 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:34.009
 can see lime and wash the potato 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.640
 I calculated about 6 potatoes per person because 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.640
 this food 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.590
 once we have here the meat what 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.520
 we are going to do is take it out because if not 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 it will never cool 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.070
 I'm going to take it out that you can see 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.400
 the size of the meat is more bone than 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 meat 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.430
 put enough meat we're going to 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.220
 let cool there is once the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:07.550
 meat is already colder what I did and not 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.560
 I was recording sorry can take away 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.630
 these bones that I had and just remove it 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.240
 with his hand because his 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.620
 habit of removing them and as you can see 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.000
 I started how to tear up I do not know 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.000
 and little bits 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.350
 and the next thing we're going to do is going to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.630
 be a marta heart or hit and crush 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.550
 with this gadget that I have if you 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.540
 they do not have this they can do it with a 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.310
 pebble or with something hard that they have 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.440
 good once you have everything 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.370
 Crushed to see how it got thin 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.799
 I put all of them with what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.470
 Yes ends neatly and the next thing 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.470
 I'm going to be going to be throw lemon 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.580
 if not a lot if not a little bit in each 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.580
 bit 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.740
 it's very good do not forget 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.740
 no bit 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.180
 Once you have thrown the whole lemon 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.380
 each each bit grab a little bit of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.520
 come out and let's also throw 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.520
 to every bit 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.739
 and now I'm going to dump it and I'm going to do what 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.349
 same again put lemon and a little 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.700
 of salt less because we already put enough 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.700
 now 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.340
 now to know when the papaya is 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.270
 good list I put it on a strong fire 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.240
 Y 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.010
 let it start to boil and leave it 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.500
 after it started to boil I left it 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.780
 like 10 more minutes and a little bit 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.740
 then to know if it is already going to 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.880
 click and come with as input of your 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.280
 habit then it is already withered 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.380
 I'll leave it for another three minutes and 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.290
 then I go immediately you have to 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.980
 drain, be very careful with the 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.980
 steam that comes out 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 Well, I'm going to tell you what I did in 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.590
 Once the water was drained, I took out the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.129
 Dad with a fork and I put everything in 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.129
 this pot 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.479
 and as the water was already boiling just 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.639
 I put three eggs to make him pass 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:55.030
 the egg and like the water I'm already seeing 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:57.700
 we should leave about 57 maximum 10 minutes 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.010
 and the last step that they are going to do is going to 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.010
 be frying 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.600
 anise
