00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hello 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.309
 last day here from the las series 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 vegas we are doing our last 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.450
 tours between the stands especially for 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 show you the news announced here 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.779
 at the fair but we still had 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.060
 way to learn more about ours 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.519
 video and we start from the stand and inside 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.160
 where we have two really mini PCs 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.500
 interesting are the new looks 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 with soc broadway 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 both types of new blogs 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.719
 therefore they have different configurations 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 we have 3 May five of fifth 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.629
 generation 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 the main difference lies in the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.149
 storage the smaller one of them 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 it only mounts for an ssd so nothing 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 special weapons with while on a large 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 thought maybe if lightly floured 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 business with love on the coach 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.730
 sin both continue 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.090
 however the possibility to expand the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.390
 memory that is a ddr3l that comes up 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.180
 to a maximum of 16 GB and both 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 share the good park of door and that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 we find both the front and back is the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 connectivity we have 10 in the part 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.640
 front we have two usb and jack the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.979
 headphone connector and microphone 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 in the back other usb 3.0 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.509
 mini hdmi mini displayport ethernet e 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.300
 in the back you can see 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.220
 also two ventilation grids in fact 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.720
 these are not devices 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.659
 completely do them if there is a small one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.300
 venturina in the upper part above the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 soc who cools it, however, according to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.500
 what was declared to us 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.909
 from the company will arrive soon 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 time also of the devices with the helmet 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.130
 with passive heat sink so without the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.569
 need ventolin and we don't have it yet 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 information regarding the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.060
 price and availability of these 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.330
 devices 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.180
 in Italy, however, at least we expect it 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 that are in the price range of the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.130
 previous also because they are ppc devices 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
 which in any case should not be possible 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.760
 allow prices too high because 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.130
 otherwise they lose the band of public 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.510
 main to which they are dedicated however 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 we will see and soon we will have others 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.160
 information we will announce them we close 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.810
 the video to make a little gem 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.850
 in fact we therefore have a prototype for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 a mini pc of the future of internal like 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 you can see the feature 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.760
 the most interesting one is 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.609
 definitely the fact that it is a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.140
 connector to choose which one from us 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.910
 processors go to mount then in the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.520
 intel's future is going 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.100
 outline the scenarios in which the mini PCs 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.680
 a lot of can be customized 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.390
 more choosing is then changing then 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.520
 following upgrades over time al 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.400
 ahram both the processor and the storage 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.200
 these were the new luxury yachts with 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.940
