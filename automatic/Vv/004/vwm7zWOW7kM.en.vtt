00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 today gets really violent and we 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.980
 Betrayed but no time so was going on 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.990
 centro hello friends, the art now times 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.420
 well art is and usually somewhere 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.969
 thinking between waterpark customers 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.970
 settled is that is also clear to me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 but that is also true 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.900
 can be controversial and disturbing 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.609
 proves the video game by ryan lam and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 video plays as stop so i can 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:36.690
 also start again and adolescence 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:39.300
 later the game of the play offs mobile phone 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.940
 high represents the killing spree on the sandy 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
 hug elementary school man plays the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.750
 amoklÃ¤ufer and sense it is everything and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.010
 killing everyone is wrong 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 sick and stupid yes yes yes not necessarily 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.510
 this flash games in principle criticism with 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.300
 the hammer on the head again and again 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 everything is minimalist depressing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 and pull down and is so far away from 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 one becomes fun or tragic 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 original case prompted his 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.299
 shoot your own mother 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.299
 [Music] 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.140
 The game suddenly through at once 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 Run and shoot everything you play 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 different modes free exactly that 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.869
 represent what after the killing spree in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.189
 the usa was so discussed at the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.450
 But she has to possess firearms 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.159
 safely stowed that is the culprit 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 would not have arrived but only 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 His katana also admitted that it was for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.799
 someone who obviously wants tomorrow 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.270
 no hindrance or third mode on 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.470
 the teacher by default 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 firearms are equipped 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 However, they have scruples and fear 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.840
 and can only handle it badly 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.400
 thus protect it for the amok so 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 less of a danger there that is 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.250
 However, the option the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.259
 weapons lobby in the us the most 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.490
 Only weapons can arms 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.979
 fight 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.500
 we do not have enough 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.470
 negative examples 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.630
 because they are fun this is seriously 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 I understand the intention behind that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.810
 play and also the social criticism 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.020
 who does not understand that and just 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.090
 Having fun playing it helps 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.560
 but is it really art when it does 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.720
 but declared as a game 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.520
 relatives of victims of the andy hug 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.959
 cleavers massacre split 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 opinion which is absolutely understandable 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.400
 The arms lobby in turn feels that way 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.410
 properly adored even goes so far 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.630
 and denotes rows lambert public 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.690
 as a poor copy of one 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.000
 people hit dogs bark 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.459
 there is clearly a whole lot 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 ignition and discussion material as you can see 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.959
 to stage such a flash games 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.280
 sick and perverted or just ingenious 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.380
 just a social criticism 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 a bit unethical or 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.160
 unaesthetic at suggestion hammer 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.300
 the kneecaps 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.620
 Personally, I'm a bit too 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.180
 zwiegespalten must say however that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.360
 you really feel when playing 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.890
 I do not really want that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.630
 and also the modes represent a lot 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.640
 nice if someone who just helps it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.440
 he mentally supports and from 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 it will catch someone's firearm 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 Close away or still possible teachers 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.510
 equip with weapons all that brings 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.010
 nothing if you look at individual person 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 Craps and just do not pay attention 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.120
 are your opinion on this project 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 in the comments I'm extremely curious 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.130
 and I will be very happy in the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.470
 discussion affect the wall 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.910
 only a theme it is unfortunately worship today 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.360
 completely planned that the whole 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.060

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.040
 Battlefield 4 Monster Hunter Ultimate 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.970
 and selda link between world was easy 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.880

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:08.520
 It was an honor to me a video of her 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:11.840
