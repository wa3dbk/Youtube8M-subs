00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
speed on the front so 20 all together so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.560 
speed on the front so 20 all together so
if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> spend<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.300> more

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
if you want to spend a little bit more

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
if you want to spend a little bit more
there's<00:01:00.780> another<00:01:00.960> modern<00:01:01.230> star<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.800> what's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
there's another modern star here what's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
there's another modern star here what's
the<00:01:02.370> difference<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.180> yep<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the difference with this one yep so this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
the difference with this one yep so this
is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> next<00:01:04.530> step<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> range<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
is the next step up in the range so this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.350 
is the next step up in the range so this
is<00:01:05.970> an<00:01:06.090> Obi<00:01:06.590> c7<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.100> essentially<00:01:08.880> exactly<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is an Obi c7 so essentially exactly the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
is an Obi c7 so essentially exactly the
same<00:01:09.570> frame<00:01:09.930> different<00:01:10.590> color<00:01:10.799> frame<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
same frame different color frame but you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.300 
same frame different color frame but you
go<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> better<00:01:12.659> group<00:01:12.930> set<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.010> better

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
go to a better group set and better

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
go to a better group set and better
guess<00:01:15.090> finishing<00:01:15.540> kit<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:16.740> by

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
guess finishing kit so what I mean by

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.609 
guess finishing kit so what I mean by
that<00:01:17.189> finishing<00:01:17.850> kit<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.180> guess<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.990> saddle<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that finishing kit I guess the saddle is

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
that finishing kit I guess the saddle is
a<00:01:19.680> physic<00:01:20.040> area<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:20.939> elite<00:01:21.210> sort<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
a physic area which is an elite sort of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.609 
a physic area which is an elite sort of

Road race saddle again Carbon seat post
carbon<00:01:26.580> handlebars<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.470> better

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
carbon handlebars you go to a better

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.789 
carbon handlebars you go to a better
wheel<00:01:28.979> set<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.420> maverick<00:01:30.900> cerium

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
wheel set in that it's a maverick cerium

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.730 
wheel set in that it's a maverick cerium
SL<00:01:32.159> wheel<00:01:32.430> set<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:33.240> rolls<00:01:33.780> better<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
SL wheel set which rolls better and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.120 
SL wheel set which rolls better and
significantly<00:01:35.430> lighter<00:01:36.350> for<00:01:37.350> example<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
significantly lighter for example the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.260 
significantly lighter for example the
front<00:01:38.340> hub<00:01:38.610> has<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.420> carbon<00:01:40.850> internal<00:01:41.850> front

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
front hub has a carbon internal front

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
front hub has a carbon internal front
hub<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> Shimano<00:01:45.180> dura-ace<00:01:45.750> which

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hub and you go to Shimano dura-ace which

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.649 
hub and you go to Shimano dura-ace which
is<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> top<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> range<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.579> Shimano

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is the top of the range in Shimano

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
is the top of the range in Shimano
so<00:01:49.350> rolls<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.130> better<00:01:50.340> less<00:01:50.670> energy

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so rolls a bit better less energy

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.190 
so rolls a bit better less energy
required<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.799> yes<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.210> an<00:01:54.329> elite<00:01:54.600> road<00:01:54.930> race

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

it's designed to be extremely stiff in
the<00:02:17.110> frame<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.010> all<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:18.490> energy<00:02:18.820> that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
the frame so that all your energy that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.020 
the frame so that all your energy that
goes<00:02:19.120> into<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.510> bike<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.990> driving<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> forward

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
goes into the bike is driving it forward

goes into the bike is driving it forward
this<00:02:22.030> particular<00:02:22.780> bike<00:02:23.290> has<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.610> features

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this particular bike has little features

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600 
this particular bike has little features
like<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.770> aerodynamic<00:02:26.770> slots<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.520> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
like the aerodynamic slots here in the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.310 
like the aerodynamic slots here in the
fork<00:02:27.880> which<00:02:28.150> are<00:02:28.270> designed<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.720> pull<00:02:28.960> air<00:02:29.170> away

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
fork which are designed to pull air away

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.070 
fork which are designed to pull air away
from<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.860> wheel<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.700> reduce<00:02:31.210> drag<00:02:31.540> actually

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
from the wheel and reduce drag actually

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.410 
from the wheel and reduce drag actually
in<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> wheel<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.710> air<00:02:33.370> disruption<00:02:33.910> material

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
in the wheel and air disruption material

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
in the wheel and air disruption material
on<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.600> sides<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.110> frame<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> bike

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
on the sides of the frame so the bike

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.360 
on the sides of the frame so the bike
just<00:02:36.520> cuts<00:02:36.850> through<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.210> air<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.630> knife

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
just cuts through the air like a knife

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.190 
just cuts through the air like a knife
other<00:02:39.370> sort<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.270> differences<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.810> guess<00:02:40.990> is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
other sort of differences I guess is

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.470 
other sort of differences I guess is
this<00:02:41.380> bike<00:02:41.590> has<00:02:41.800> Campagnolo<00:02:42.700> super<00:02:43.120> record

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
this bike has Campagnolo super record

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.070 
this bike has Campagnolo super record
and<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:44.200> 11<00:02:44.590> speed<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.550> 10<00:02:45.880> speed<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.780> up<00:02:46.900> to

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and it's 11 speed so 10 speed and up to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.560 
and it's 11 speed so 10 speed and up to
11<00:02:47.380> speed<00:02:47.760> which<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.970> gives<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.300> extra

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
11 speed which just gives you that extra

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.860 
11 speed which just gives you that extra
gear<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.650> broader<00:02:51.190> range<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.760> guess<00:02:51.970> when

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
gear and a broader range I guess when

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.620 
gear and a broader range I guess when
you're<00:02:52.989> riding<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.880> yeah<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.330> go<00:02:55.510> up
