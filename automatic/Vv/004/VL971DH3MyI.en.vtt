I'm<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> try<00:00:53.520> her<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.640> until<00:00:53.850> they

get<00:00:54.239> her<00:00:54.649> higher<00:00:55.649> promotions<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.460> still

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
get her higher promotions but still

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
get her higher promotions but still
looks<00:00:57.540> like<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:58.170> decent<00:00:58.350> character<00:00:58.860> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
looks like a pretty decent character and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.110 
looks like a pretty decent character and
that's<00:00:59.130> definitely<00:00:59.309> why<00:00:59.579> she's<00:00:59.820> one<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that's definitely why she's one of the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.510 
that's definitely why she's one of the
rewards<00:01:00.540> in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> multiplayer<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.370> we'll

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
rewards in the multiplayer so now we'll

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420 
rewards in the multiplayer so now we'll
just<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.030> show<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.540> these<00:01:03.690> specials

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
just go and show some of these specials

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
just go and show some of these specials
they<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.880> cool<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:07.100> let's<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they are pretty cool so let's take a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
they are pretty cool so let's take a
look<00:01:08.929> so<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.020> first<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.469> is<00:01:10.499> the<00:01:10.770> same<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.069> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
look so the first one is the same as the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.359 
look so the first one is the same as the
other<00:01:11.310> Batgirl<00:01:11.759> I<00:01:11.850> believe<00:01:12.829> it's<00:01:13.829> called<00:01:14.009> some

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
other Batgirl I believe it's called some

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
other Batgirl I believe it's called some
sort<00:01:14.579> of<00:01:14.729> art<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> deception<00:01:15.539> here<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> she

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sort of art of deception here and she

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.410 
sort of art of deception here and she
launches<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.859> projectile<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.819> always<00:01:18.179> like

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
launches a projectile so I always like

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.719 
launches a projectile so I always like
the<00:01:18.539> projectile<00:01:19.109> for<00:01:19.560> specials<00:01:20.009> because

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the projectile for specials because

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
the projectile for specials because
there's<00:01:21.149> no<00:01:21.270> chance<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.719> missing<00:01:22.109> if

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
there's no chance of them missing if

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
there's no chance of them missing if
you're<00:01:22.380> too<00:01:22.499> far<00:01:22.679> away<00:01:22.889> from<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> other

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're too far away from the other

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.959 
you're too far away from the other
player<00:01:23.999> and<00:01:24.029> the<00:01:24.889> special<00:01:25.889> is<00:01:26.039> for<00:01:26.579> like<00:01:26.759> close

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
player and the special is for like close

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.599 
player and the special is for like close
range<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.509> you'll<00:01:27.719> miss<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.799> you'll<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.459> no

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
range then you'll miss and you'll do no

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.550 
range then you'll miss and you'll do no
damage<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.179> the<00:01:30.299> projectile<00:01:31.079> ones<00:01:31.289> are<00:01:31.380> always

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
damage so the projectile ones are always

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.249 
damage so the projectile ones are always
nice<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.569> she<00:01:33.569> actually<00:01:33.689> doesn't<00:01:34.020> even<00:01:34.049> look

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
nice and she actually doesn't even look

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.629 
nice and she actually doesn't even look
like<00:01:34.319> she's<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.679> human<00:01:35.069> she<00:01:35.189> looks<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.429> she's

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
like she's a human she looks like she's

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.249 
like she's a human she looks like she's
like<00:01:35.819> some<00:01:36.240> sort<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> demon<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:36.959> you<00:01:37.109> can't

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you look pretty cool here's a second

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.879 
you look pretty cool here's a second
move<00:01:40.950> called<00:01:41.219> no-man's<00:01:41.549> land<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.649> she<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
move called no-man's land and she just

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:45.949 
move called no-man's land and she just
keeps<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.549> stabbing<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.389> looks<00:01:45.569> like<00:01:45.749> and

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
keeps this stabbing it looks like and

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.459 
keeps this stabbing it looks like and
then<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.319> second<00:01:47.039> attack<00:01:48.109> so<00:01:49.109> we're<00:01:49.319> not<00:01:49.380> really

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
then a second attack so we're not really

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.230 
then a second attack so we're not really
on<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.709> hard<00:01:49.889> level<00:01:50.069> here<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:51.029> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
on a hard level here but not this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.080 
on a hard level here but not this
character's<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.979> pretty<00:01:52.979> easily<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.609> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
character's out pretty easily and the
