00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello to all yemen rockies and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.860
 video style of justin and in this 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.630
 opportunity I will show you how 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.850
 can complete the queen's contract 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.440
 called silent fang for 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.960
 to be able to complete it is quite simple 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.150
 we're just going to start a patrol 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.890
 on the ground or at the cosmodrome and we 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.320
 let's direct to the location 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.970
 called the caves then well 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.410
 if you do not know how to get to that 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.210
 location called the routes 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.010
 just follow the route this 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 video is pretty easy so as 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.519
 well once I take the opportunity to tell you 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.930
 that if they need to complete any 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.790
 another contract contacts the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.170
 reigns down here in the description of 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 this video will be able to find the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.469
 playlist with all the contacts there 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.420
 so far then there they go to 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.670
 can find the location like kill 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.050
 your enemies and obviously the most 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.420
 simple to be able to complete those 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.920
 contracts in this journey towards 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.329
 lights are going to find a lot 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.340
 of enemies can take to make 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.260
 contracts can take to go up 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.120
 level your weapons to your armors or 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.950
 just ignore and pass by 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.960
 all his enemies like he was doing 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.489
 Well I think we get here to the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.170
 location called the grottos let's go 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.610
 to find the enemies here and we're going to 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.229
 see two roads one that goes towards the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.729
 right or one that goes to the left 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.120
 we have to take the dlc towards the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.920
 left 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.630
 to also count here a few 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.610
 scums so just the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.110
 we eliminate and later on we are going to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.390
 to be able to find the enemy called 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 silent fang is an enemy that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.660
 is invisible so be careful 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.710
 for him they will be able to see then what 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.100
 only they are going to do is simply 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.320
 eliminate it and we have to kill it three 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.480
 times so we're not going to kill him 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.190
 the first time after that what 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.850
 we have to do is simply 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.740
 get out of this of this patrol and 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 restart it to be able to kill it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.070
 the other times here there is no more 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.930
 enemies then implement we're going to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.880
 go out and let's go to orbit to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.290
 to be able to go back and kill again that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.180
 we have to do three times already once 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.560
 that we have killed him three times 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.480
 we will be able to complete the contract 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 so I hope you liked the 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.350
