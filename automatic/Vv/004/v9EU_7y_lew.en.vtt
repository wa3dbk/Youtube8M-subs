00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.659
 inside the package by opening it 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.999
 now you remove the first level there is obviously battery 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.129
 a small screwdriver that will be to close some parts 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.289
 the cellular insect stalks was just see 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.749

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.980
 Italian English you open it and inside there is the charger 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.680
 the charger cable is a hook to hold it at the neck 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.180
 fix it some pictures 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 now we assemble everything and see how it works 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.610
 here we are, we have mounted everything on the cell phone while I feel 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.699
 inside a sim e 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.860
 age we put the battery 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 attached to the agreement and now we turn on luu 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.740
 tekno promotur pedigree turns on 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.680
 there is a kitten that welcomes us with a small icon, obviously there is also in 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.950
 agency 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.650
 but Italian than them in English and as you can see here there are fourteen 1 2 3 e4a 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 these are the only numbers that can practically be set 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.270
 within the mobile phones so that the child can call exclusively 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.130
 are those moments can not make other numbers 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.050
 epo receive sms but can only send sms configured oaks here can tell me 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.610
 that I am all right I am coming something like this 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.260
 re hadley function in my opinion that if it was high unbelievable and they are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.350
 geolocation or you can send a text message to your child's mobile e 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 to go back one on the other sem stb will warn 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.690
 on the position of the child, that is, he will tell the local child enel buried 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 in you believed because it is enough to set 4 places where the baby ramen is found 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.410
 the cell phone doesn't tell me yes the children is in those places 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.990
 the anti-robbery function what in what is the anti-robbery function is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.960
 practically if the child from the earthquake open the cellphone they a theme way of 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.740
 an attacker, a thief, substituted the mobile phone for another sim 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.830
 sim to you will arrive on your mobile 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.800
 a message that warns you recount who is the sim and if you think 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.840
 what is the wall that is present in the sim at this moment 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.349
 and the one according to me m 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.129
 the most beautiful source that in sanremo experience care of the disk of the dell 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.590
 ie remote listening 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.520
 the child in this phone in hand two text this cell phone 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:39.480
 the cell phone will call you back without that but - if you notice it you can 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.699
 listening to what is happening is that the child has done nothing 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.859
 now we'll try with my daughter and see if it works 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.809
 here I am again what I did omit the cell phone to dedicate myself to 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:51.929
 my daughter's neck 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.789
 and now I'm texting my cell phone so that you call me back with 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.199
 another cell phone 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.629
 I'm hating 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.679
 a private message to send you a monitor 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.629
 and I really will see now that the phone just the two little girls just 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.679
 will receive 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.869
 command 5 will recall and we will not be able to hear what it is doing 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.659
 little girl at that moment 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.799
 obviously I'm a bit the same as 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.590
 - send sms sacrifice the recalls recite 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.899
 the print 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 here here 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.129
 pressing the answer button 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.149
 I will hear what the child is up to 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.760
 I think it's really a very interesting feature 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.450
 and why if you want to know what he is doing at least in this way you can 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.369
 understand it 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.879
 here is the little girl with her feet in her hand who immediately tries to take it apart 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.899
 surely for you too much too many novative tools for you too 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:52.629
 small 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.499
 for his hands declaredly for children 4 5 years 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.569
