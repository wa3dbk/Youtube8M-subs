00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:09.889
 and very good people I bring you a new 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.629
 arc video written in which you 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.719
 I will teach how to build the soil of 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.940
 a house on slope fixed that I'm 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.220
 building my house new house the 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.150
 pending and I'm putting 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.699
 bigas and worth the foundation that is for 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.130
 start the houses are these but if I 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.010
 I come here I want to put foundation here 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 I can as I followed what the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.360
 game is called beijing 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.519
 set to put sailing is necessary 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.309
 put columns I here tried to put 16 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.269
 bit and it tells me that I need a fundation 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.269
 support that I can get it too 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.620
 with beams I think putting this here 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.930
 beam 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.970
 and we will make it more beautiful 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.240
 well I could put you down but I think that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.040
 with this is going to be worth to see if measurement does not 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.920
 let's put beam here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.479
 I put the beam here that leaves me 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.479
 put does not let me put the bottom 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.150
 I ate a barry wine 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.990
 How is it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 look at me let me put more sailing as 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 here 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 another one here and another 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.770
 If I had put 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.190
 so down I would not have needed to put 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.090
 but good is there as a master beam 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 that is very good because that's how it is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.890
 places 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.350
 to robot rock this is how it 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.540
 get put this house's floor in 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.870
 fixed, I can move around 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.100
 here quietly 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.210
 and I will continue to put 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.970
 not to the ground 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.760
 let's take it from here and see colleague 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.740
 what state are you talking about little trees 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.270
 to go taking more soil 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.560
 I think one more row is going to be worth 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.560
 let's see here 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:33.590
 this up close is very good and I'm missing 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:35.540
 the beam we're going to put beams around here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.530
 as I said this about making houses is very 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.540
 all right 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.209
 because it goes up quite enough level 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.329
 as you're aiming with the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:52.129
 camera lets you let you go putting more 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:54.700
 things we are going to put I think that it was going 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.829
 to be necessary to put the beam here 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.280
 okay, I think, putting that 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.780
 you come here we're going to form ranks here at 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.780
 animal that also and what you say 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.940
 picasa 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.210
 Do not say more 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.080
 to see if I think putting it here 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.080
 stop 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.850
 and others around here I think it's going to leave me 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.450
 put it 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.450
 Let's see 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.739
 it does not leave me so we're going to put 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.110
 here the beam goodbye there's almost 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.629
 this what sometimes makes it super 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 cool hard put it in one place and if of 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.920
 Suddenly you get other 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.510
 so let's see if we're going to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.510
 try to put that view 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.870
 is this and kick it and this gap does not 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.870
 let me put it I do not see anything 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.740
 I'm filling everything with beams to put 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.919
 a single 6 link that I was missing from very 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.919
 all right 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.540
 and here he is going to hang his 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.520
 friends 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.870
 look, let's put a little bit of post 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 here 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.220
 that holds up a dinosaur that is 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.289
 up is that good theory not because 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.149
 then when you do 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.490
 make more walls the greeks are going to 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:55.680
 do not miss fixes that endures 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.600
 perfectly the passage of a dinosaur 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.129
 to the corner included 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.789
 including the written 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.039
 good people I leave you here with the view 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.919
