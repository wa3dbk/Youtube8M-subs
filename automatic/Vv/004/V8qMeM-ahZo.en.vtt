00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.299
 yo people welcome to klup.nl and this one 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.320
 times i'll show you how to make a lego 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.820
 plane transforma makes you start 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.890
 with simple 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.160
 wheels ordinary copa is in a store or 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.160
 so 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:31.939
 2 by 2 and then you put a 2 by 2 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:35.840
 block up then pick up a 2 by 6 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:39.230
 the good 2 bars and that seed or so hope 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.010
 then this is a package in a wheel 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.649
 thing do not know where you get them I like 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.030
 by a set 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.309
 then you set that day at the end then pack 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.010
 you this 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.390
 I don't really know what it is but 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.660
 that will be the defenses of being old 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:15.920
 plane then you put such a grid 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:21.229
 then pick up such a piece of question from this one 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.439
 claws on and from those claws 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.030
 put your little half 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:36.680
 squares on it with a big side to it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:39.400
 outside of that you do twice then you put 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.400
 that to this 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.670
 this becomes his feet that they walk like that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.210
 that puts you there at the end it snap 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:04.390
 you do this then you grab one by two 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:04.390
 little janae is a block you put on it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 then grab one 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.860
 a white way ordinary block 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:21.880
 and that you put so then you grab a 2 by 2 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.880
 low block 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:33.950
 grab a bench like that 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:41.750
 put your days then grab a 1 by 2 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:46.910
 small thin block with a top on and on again 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.560
 then you grab half the roof light then 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.560
 put it here on the back 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.459
 then you have this well then grab this one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.100
 no not yet 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.300
 can you do that 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.080
 set that day up 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.120
 you have this so it starts a bit on 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.370
 a plane Liking 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.710
 then grab a we a round pipes 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.710
 put it on the second for taste 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:48.610
 then grab a 2 by 4 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:58.600
 thin skirt and then you put this thing to size 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:04.080
 tops on two sides and then you put them 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 right up at the bottom so you have this 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.310
 then you grab 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.820
 such a block does not know what it is but 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.299
 it has tops on two sides 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.820
 and here is a hole in it and on the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:28.590
 other side can put ice on that suit 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:40.470
 you then 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:50.000
 and put such a one with this to that side 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:50.000
 to then pick up some microphone or sauce 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.160
 such a microphony is back in no time 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.940
 and then you put a yes a red and yellow and 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:10.440
 blue thing for the fire or something from it 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:13.400
 plane from the engine oh and you put that 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.400
 so on it 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 then you take this away and then study 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.260
 just the pin in you have this that is 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:36.720
 a wing and with that you put a keg 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:45.270
 him here on you must put them first 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:46.500
 then you put this there on we 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.419
 can do this 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.410
 you make that one more time, but then for 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.410
 the other side 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.620
 so 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.789
 put it on again and then you have 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.789
 you own a plane 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.330
 so it's time like that 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.240
 and these are the engines with those 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.150
 fire to come out and then transforms 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.900
 he then becomes this 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.900
 guns 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:27.219
 expand this 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.860
 to this so often that you can 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:33.000
 walk along 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.000
 are these guns 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:38.199
 and this is she's head with i don't know if 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.250
 see something but there are two of them 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:45.370
 put those balls on top and then they 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:50.800
 our eyes and these are antennas or something like that 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:52.330
 radio well that is my lego plane 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.460
 transformer 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.460
 hopefully you enjoyed and love it
