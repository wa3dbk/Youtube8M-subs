00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 We'll see, we'll go through 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.100
 a lot of thing but always has a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.779
 business you speak 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.250
 people I do not believe it happened 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.889
 with me 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 I do not believe that my case does not 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.269
 believe it was a football match 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.070
 worst meeting is to see and look that I am 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.029
 good in this business of not having meetings 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 cool 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.920
 so then meeting was an overcoming 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 There was this boy who was with me 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.060
 I do not pass his name is very wrong 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 talking about him called boys selection 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 had the boy seduction and I liked it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 much of Sao Paulo's boy - he thought 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.680
 He liked it very cute and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 It seemed to be really cool and we started 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 to talk or on a subject that people 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 had in common was a harry potter who 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 He liked it a lot and we 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 talking about it and after some 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 time we started talking in the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 school he was not from my year he 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 was a year younger in our conversations 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.149
 in school did not work as well as 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.699
 the conversations online because I was 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.789
 talking normally and he was 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.789
 day off 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:13.740
 All right, well, you know that and she went 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 Wow he's really shy really not 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 It was meant for us to talk like that. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 can establish a communication 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 but then I thought our maybe the problem 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.509
 school because it may not be 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 assumed that it was very likely 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.390
 and then I had already had this type of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.770
 problem because I do not want the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 people know why they can tell 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 with your parents 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.880
 one thing you're not prepared for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.119
 to ride still and can throw dung 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.650
 giant guy was not me that was not 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.689
 advance the boy's signal 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.540
 We came home to stay with him at 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.070
 internet I went like this, let's get out of love 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 to a place far away so no one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.110
 with these people and he gets well and he got 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.130
 very excited about the idea was this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.490
 I hit 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.799
 Let's go to the republic. 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.500
 I did not like anything about Sao Paulo 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.969
 had spent many years lived in sÃ£o 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.920

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.689
 I came to the city where you live what is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780
 very small that has nothing to do 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.640
 slowly the republic 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 Come on, he had said it was a place. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.260
 beautiful and that he wanted to live there 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.590
 We arrived there repubblica that we are 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.310

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.250

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.470
 Shut the fuck up

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.440
 market to get people food 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.160

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.920

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.290
 He turned around and said no, I'm not gay, I know. 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.330
 I understand this is kind when the 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.740

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.860
 boys that we had already stayed in 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.959
 Life was very happy, I was rich. 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.640
 It's amazing, and I know I've been 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.049

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.010
 Young anyway I was very

 It's exactly the same cell phone and he's 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.070

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.790

 is with our condition money 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.189

 money after you have completed the 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.229
 we went home and he 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.060
 half-thrilled on the way in 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.370
 who started to talk that he had not 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.780
 His parents wanted to leave. 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.129
 he said he was going to spend the afternoon at 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.120
 School library I was like 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.770
 of course if that course because right 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.030
 was just coming out that we did not 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.520
 wanted no one to know that he 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.219
 I was out there leading his parents 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.169
 the country then goes there because it 's a place 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.210
 Great I do not know if you know but I will live 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.009
 there because it ended up god online 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.840
 I did not even have to tell anyone because 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.469
 as he is part he was robbed on his own 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.300
 school 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.430
 We even dressed in uniform. 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.639
 your extremely type uniform 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.139
 vulnerable to an agent was dumb I 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.389
 I 've never been so good in my entire life. 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.340
 So , why did I tell this story? 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.810
 It's because I love to laugh at my 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.580
 face too 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.889
 but it's because I want you to know 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.500
 that first is normal 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.270
 completely normal encounters do not give 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.159
 sure does not mean that you do not 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.860
 will work for the person you 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:11.050
 like this case that was not in the same 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.659
 but it could happen that everything has stayed 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.180
 well after second never lie 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:18.520
 hands when I do not do this bbb 10 you 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.870
 still a teenager at school and is 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.550
 dating someone hidden 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.889
 I think of all the things that can give 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.409
 wrong because they're probably going to 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.449
 wrong in a very bizarre way and you do not 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.159
 he has to fix this boy he does not 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.849
 You never talked to me like this for long. 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.319
 time 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.659
 when we met in the 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:38.800
 The sidewalk he passed through is pure 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:41.800
 funny but after a few years he 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.169
 put both with his sexuality 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.680
 while with his cell phone I do not know how 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:51.180
 solve the story but that's it in 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.180
 radar account sometimes 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:02.350
 This is the hard part that is 

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.949
 so it 's the next I will not 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.810
 kill 

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:07.710
 I'm not going to hurt you, just pass me the 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.710
 cell phone money
