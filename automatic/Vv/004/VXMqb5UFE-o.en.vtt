00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
arkham knight he looks not 47 he looks

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.820 
arkham knight he looks not 47 he looks
more<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.340> 40<00:02:12.030> 38

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
more like 40 38

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.520 
more like 40 38
39<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.240> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.570> over<00:02:14.600> what<00:02:15.380> this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
39 so I'm going to go over what this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.860 
39 so I'm going to go over what this
25-year<00:02:16.100> jump<00:02:16.640> between<00:02:16.790> origins<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.630> night

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
25-year jump between origins and night

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.350 
25-year jump between origins and night
would<00:02:18.080> mean<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.680> basically<00:02:19.160> run<00:02:19.790> down<00:02:20.060> all

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
would mean and basically run down all

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.480 
would mean and basically run down all
the<00:02:20.720> facts<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.320> how<00:02:21.440> old<00:02:21.470> everyone<00:02:22.130> would<00:02:22.250> be

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
the facts and how old everyone would be

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.150 
the facts and how old everyone would be
just<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.390> what<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.170> continuity<00:02:24.800> would<00:02:24.950> be

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
just to see what the continuity would be

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.300 
just to see what the continuity would be
like<00:02:25.400> if<00:02:25.720> origins<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:27.050> 25<00:02:27.530> years<00:02:27.560> before

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
like if origins was 25 years before

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.190 
like if origins was 25 years before
Batman<00:02:28.580> Dark<00:02:28.820> Knight<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:30.020> mean

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
Batman Dark Knight so that would mean

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.160 
Batman Dark Knight so that would mean
that<00:02:30.260> Batman<00:02:30.950> Bruce<00:02:31.370> Wayne<00:02:31.700> was<00:02:31.970> around<00:02:32.270> 23

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
that Batman Bruce Wayne was around 23

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.740 
that Batman Bruce Wayne was around 23
around<00:02:33.620> origins<00:02:34.160> then<00:02:34.730> when<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> stolen<00:02:35.300> Arkham

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
around origins then when a stolen Arkham

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.950 
around origins then when a stolen Arkham
the<00:02:36.020> movie<00:02:36.440> he<00:02:36.890> would<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.190> around<00:02:37.460> 44<00:02:38.240> that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
the movie he would be around 44 that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.320 
the movie he would be around 44 that
enduring<00:02:39.320> asylum<00:02:39.830> who<00:02:40.010> has<00:02:40.130> been<00:02:40.280> 45<00:02:40.790> during

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
enduring asylum who has been 45 during

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.570 
enduring asylum who has been 45 during
Arkham<00:02:41.780> City<00:02:42.020> he<00:02:42.380> would<00:02:42.470> be<00:02:42.560> 46<00:02:43.130> enduring

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
Arkham City he would be 46 enduring

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.720 
Arkham City he would be 46 enduring
darker<00:02:43.850> Mikey<00:02:44.210> be<00:02:44.360> 47<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.560> basically<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.490> main

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
darker Mikey be 47 so basically the main

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.940 
darker Mikey be 47 so basically the main
games<00:02:47.120> we've<00:02:47.420> been<00:02:47.570> playing<00:02:47.900> Batman<00:02:48.770> was

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
games we've been playing Batman was

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.540 
games we've been playing Batman was
around<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> age<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.850> 45<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.870> 50<00:02:51.340> which<00:02:52.340> is

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
around the age of 45 to 50 which is

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.670 
around the age of 45 to 50 which is
believable<00:02:53.300> because<00:02:53.510> Batman<00:02:54.110> has<00:02:54.350> been

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
believable because Batman has been

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.490 
believable because Batman has been
kicking<00:02:55.130> ass<00:02:55.160> around<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.820> age<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.230> not

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
kicking ass around that age but it's not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.170 
kicking ass around that age but it's not
the<00:02:57.530> peak<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.040> human<00:02:58.310> ability<00:02:58.730> which<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.030> like

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the peak of human ability which is like

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.780 
the peak of human ability which is like
35<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.930> 40<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:01.250> doesn't<00:03:01.400> really<00:03:01.520> make

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
35 to 40 it just doesn't really make

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.000 
35 to 40 it just doesn't really make
sense<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.350> would<00:03:03.440> also<00:03:03.650> mean<00:03:03.860> that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
sense so that would also mean that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.100 
sense so that would also mean that
Barbara<00:03:04.520> Gordon<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.360> batman<00:03:05.750> arkham<00:03:05.900> origins

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
Barbara Gordon in batman arkham origins

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.050 
Barbara Gordon in batman arkham origins
she<00:03:06.560> was<00:03:06.709> around<00:03:06.950> 12<00:03:07.280> years<00:03:07.340> old<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:07.820> there's<00:03:07.970> a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
she was around 12 years old if there's a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.960 
she was around 12 years old if there's a
25<00:03:08.450> jump<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.470> means<00:03:09.650> she<00:03:09.800> would<00:03:09.890> be<00:03:10.010> 37<00:03:10.790> years

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
25 jump that means she would be 37 years

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.720 
25 jump that means she would be 37 years
old<00:03:11.120> as<00:03:11.420> Oracle<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.950> Batman<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.610> the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
old as Oracle in the Batman like the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.449 
old as Oracle in the Batman like the
main<00:03:13.940> Arkham<00:03:14.390> trilogy<00:03:14.840> she<00:03:15.500> does<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:15.800> look<00:03:16.010> 37

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
main Arkham trilogy she does not look 37

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.630 
main Arkham trilogy she does not look 37
years<00:03:16.760> old<00:03:16.880> she<00:03:17.180> looks<00:03:17.390> about<00:03:18.070> 30<00:03:19.070> years<00:03:19.400> old

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
years old she looks about 30 years old

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.030 
years old she looks about 30 years old
at<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.239> top<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.290> can<00:03:21.440> maybe<00:03:21.590> go<00:03:21.800> with<00:03:21.830> like

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
at the top like I can maybe go with like

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.940 
at the top like I can maybe go with like
32<00:03:22.459> but<00:03:23.239> she's<00:03:23.420> not<00:03:23.540> 37<00:03:24.140> years<00:03:24.290> old<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.590> origin

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
32 but she's not 37 years old in origin

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
32 but she's not 37 years old in origin
so<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.280> 25-year<00:03:25.700> jump<00:03:26.150> still<00:03:26.390> does<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.660> makes

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
so this 25-year jump still does it makes

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
so this 25-year jump still does it makes
sense<00:03:27.050> now<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.800> reason<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.400> 25-year<00:03:28.850> jump

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
sense now the reason this 25-year jump

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.790 
sense now the reason this 25-year jump
makes<00:03:29.330> sense<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.900> because<00:03:29.930> all<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.590> bat

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
makes sense is because all the bat

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.680 
makes sense is because all the bat
family<00:03:31.220> events<00:03:31.700> would<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.360> fit<00:03:32.540> in

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
family events would have fit in

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.870 
family events would have fit in
perfectly<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.500> mean<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:33.980> much<00:03:34.130> stuff<00:03:34.430> happened

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
perfectly I mean so much stuff happened

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.960 
perfectly I mean so much stuff happened
with<00:03:35.330> Jason<00:03:35.630> Todd<00:03:36.080> all<00:03:36.530> three<00:03:37.130> Robins<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
with Jason Todd all three Robins the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.210 
with Jason Todd all three Robins the
build-up<00:03:38.360> history<00:03:39.290> with<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.890> villains

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
build-up history with all the villains

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.400 
build-up history with all the villains
there's<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:40.820> much<00:03:41.000> history<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:42.050> has<00:03:42.230> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
there's just so much history that has to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.030 
there's just so much history that has to
happen<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.160> 25<00:03:43.820> years<00:03:44.150> fits<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.660> perfectly

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
happen and 25 years fits it perfectly

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.040 
happen and 25 years fits it perfectly
well<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.340> original<00:03:46.850> jump<00:03:47.120> was<00:03:47.300> five<00:03:47.720> years

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
well the original jump was five years

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.410 
well the original jump was five years
which<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.739> terrible<00:03:49.459> because<00:03:49.880> not<00:03:50.390> all

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
which is just terrible because not all

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.030 
which is just terrible because not all
the<00:03:50.690> bat<00:03:50.840> family<00:03:51.230> events<00:03:51.530> could<00:03:51.620> happen<00:03:51.950> in

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
the bat family events could happen in

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.310 
the bat family events could happen in
five<00:03:52.220> years<00:03:52.580> Barbara<00:03:53.300> Gordon<00:03:53.630> didn't<00:03:54.019> become

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
five years Barbara Gordon didn't become

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.340 
five years Barbara Gordon didn't become
12<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.860> then<00:03:54.950> she's<00:03:55.220> obviously<00:03:55.580> not<00:03:55.820> 17<00:03:56.480> in

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
12 and then she's obviously not 17 in

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.990 
12 and then she's obviously not 17 in
the<00:03:57.500> freaking<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:58.100> five<00:03:58.400> years<00:03:58.580> is<00:03:58.790> just

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
the freaking like five years is just

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.220 
the freaking like five years is just
terrible<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.540> don't<00:03:59.690> even<00:03:59.750> want<00:03:59.930> to<00:03:59.989> talk<00:04:00.170> about

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
terrible I don't even want to talk about

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.740 
terrible I don't even want to talk about
it<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:01.040> what<00:04:01.190> I'm<00:04:01.310> gonna<00:04:01.459> say<00:04:01.580> now<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.239> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
it so what I'm gonna say now is the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.470 
it so what I'm gonna say now is the
perfect<00:04:03.050> jump<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.860> think<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:05.209> perfect

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
perfect jump I think the perfect

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.780 
perfect jump I think the perfect
continuity<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.530> makes<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.040> most<00:04:07.220> perfect

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
continuity that makes the most perfect

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.410 
continuity that makes the most perfect
sense<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.410> 15-year<00:04:09.410> jump<00:04:09.670> let's<00:04:10.670> say<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.269> is

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
sense a 15-year jump let's say this is

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.479 
sense a 15-year jump let's say this is
what<00:04:11.630> says<00:04:11.780> this<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.080> what<00:04:12.110> goes<00:04:12.410> around<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.950> my

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
what says this is what goes around in my

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.280 
what says this is what goes around in my
head<00:04:13.519> when<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.959> know<00:04:15.110> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
old in the main like around 24 to 27

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.490

during<00:05:15.340> City<00:05:15.700> asylum<00:05:16.360> Arkham<00:05:16.990> Knight<00:05:17.020> it

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
during City asylum Arkham Knight it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.620 
during City asylum Arkham Knight it
makes<00:05:17.710> perfect<00:05:17.889> sense<00:05:18.160> she<00:05:18.550> looks<00:05:18.760> around<00:05:18.910> 25

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
makes perfect sense she looks around 25

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.469 
makes perfect sense she looks around 25
years<00:05:19.900> old<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.740> 15-year<00:05:21.370> jump<00:05:21.669> makes<00:05:21.850> perfect

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
years old so 15-year jump makes perfect

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.940 
years old so 15-year jump makes perfect
sense<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:23.229> that's<00:05:23.410> why<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.590> think<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.860> should

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
sense so that's why I think you should

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.040 
sense so that's why I think you should
be<00:05:24.190> thinking<00:05:24.520> about<00:05:24.669> in<00:05:25.300> your<00:05:25.600> head<00:05:25.840> when

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050

be thinking about in your head when
you're<00:05:26.200> playing<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.710> arkham<00:05:27.070> game<00:05:27.280> like

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
you're playing the arkham game like

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.820 
you're playing the arkham game like

happier to know that like okay this

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.070 
happier to know that like okay this
makes<00:06:41.620> sense<00:06:41.980> so<00:06:42.670> when<00:06:43.300> origins<00:06:43.660> came<00:06:43.870> around

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
makes sense so when origins came around

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.420 
makes sense so when origins came around
it<00:06:44.290> did<00:06:44.470> piss<00:06:44.680> me<00:06:44.890> off<00:06:44.920> that's<00:06:45.160> pretty<00:06:45.370> much

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
it did piss me off that's pretty much

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.130 
it did piss me off that's pretty much
why<00:06:45.790> I<00:06:45.820> didn't<00:06:46.210> like<00:06:46.330> origins<00:06:46.780> is<00:06:46.960> because

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
why I didn't like origins is because

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.900 
why I didn't like origins is because
they've<00:06:47.290> messed<00:06:47.560> up<00:06:47.770> the<00:06:47.860> continuity<00:06:48.490> so

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
they've messed up the continuity so

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.370 
they've messed up the continuity so
that's<00:06:49.090> why<00:06:49.210> I<00:06:49.240> pretty<00:06:49.510> much<00:06:49.600> fixed<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.140> in<00:06:50.290> my

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
that's why I pretty much fixed it in my

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.350 
that's why I pretty much fixed it in my
brain<00:06:50.680> saying<00:06:51.040> okay<00:06:51.430> this<00:06:51.700> all<00:06:51.910> makes<00:06:52.120> sense

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
brain saying okay this all makes sense

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.390 
brain saying okay this all makes sense
