00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
see why it's always the Splenda packet

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.670 
see why it's always the Splenda packet
or<00:01:17.159> whichever<00:01:17.549> packet<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> choose<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.439> I

I<00:02:27.260> say<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.310> two<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.820> are<00:02:30.000> left<00:02:30.180> pick

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
I say now of the two that are left pick

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500 
I say now of the two that are left pick
one<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.470> notice<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.280> don't<00:02:32.340> say<00:02:32.790> pick<00:02:33.180> one

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
one up notice I don't say pick one

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.090 
one up notice I don't say pick one
because<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.800> say<00:02:35.040> pick<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.850> she<00:02:36.630> picks

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
because if I say pick one and she picks

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.420 
because if I say pick one and she picks
this<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.670> can't<00:02:39.390> say<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.710> pick<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.190> blend

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
this one I can't say you pick this blend

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.370 
this one I can't say you pick this blend
a<00:02:41.580> packet<00:02:42.090> because<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.510> told<00:02:42.750> her<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.900> pick<00:02:43.170> one

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
a packet because I told her to pick one

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.920 
a packet because I told her to pick one
so<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> only<00:02:44.280> say<00:02:44.610> pick<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.480> which<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
so I only say pick one up which is a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.860 
so I only say pick one up which is a
very<00:02:46.200> subtle<00:02:46.500> difference<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:47.280> pick<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.120> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
very subtle difference from pick one so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.730 
very subtle difference from pick one so
after<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.440> hand<00:02:49.620> me<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.100> say<00:02:50.340> pick<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.210> up

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
after you hand me this I say pick one up

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.710 
after you hand me this I say pick one up
now<00:02:52.740> if<00:02:52.980> she<00:02:53.220> picks<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> say<00:02:54.210> good

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
now if she picks that one I say good

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.110 
now if she picks that one I say good
we're<00:02:55.410> left<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> Splenda<00:02:56.460> pack<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.970> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
we're left with a Splenda pack and that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.080 
we're left with a Splenda pack and that
looks<00:02:57.360> fair<00:02:57.750> why<00:02:58.620> does<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.920> look<00:02:58.950> fair<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.670> took

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
looks fair why does it look fair I took

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.750 
looks fair why does it look fair I took
one<00:03:00.570> she<00:03:01.050> took<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.590> we're<00:03:02.310> left<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
one she took one we're left with a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
one she took one we're left with a
Splenda<00:03:03.210> packet<00:03:03.630> now<00:03:04.200> she<00:03:04.260> does<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.860> other

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
Splenda packet now she does it the other

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.370 
Splenda packet now she does it the other
way<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.340> ahead<00:03:05.640> put<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.910> down<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.140> hand

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
way go ahead put that down and you hand

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.090 
way go ahead put that down and you hand
me<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.100> then<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.000> say<00:03:09.590> pick<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.860> up

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
me this one and then I say pick one up

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.580 
me this one and then I say pick one up
and<00:03:11.430> she<00:03:11.580> picks<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.940> Splenda<00:03:12.510> packet<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.560> I

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
and she picks the Splenda packet now I

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.770 
and she picks the Splenda packet now I
rephrase<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.670> instructions<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
rephrase my instructions because a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.620 
rephrase my instructions because a
moment<00:03:15.990> ago<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.350> said<00:03:16.680> pick<00:03:17.310> one<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:18.600> I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
moment ago I said pick one up but now I

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.010 
moment ago I said pick one up but now I
say<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.890> picked<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.760> Splenda<00:03:21.180> packet<00:03:21.630> even

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
say you picked the Splenda packet even

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.630 
say you picked the Splenda packet even
though<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> didn't<00:03:22.440> say<00:03:22.560> pick<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.040> said<00:03:23.250> pick<00:03:23.430> one

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
though I didn't say pick I said pick one

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.960 
though I didn't say pick I said pick one
up<00:03:23.820> she<00:03:24.720> thinks<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.739> she<00:03:25.980> actually<00:03:26.190> did<00:03:26.459> pick

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
up she thinks that she actually did pick

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.270 
up she thinks that she actually did pick
the<00:03:27.390> Splenda<00:03:27.810> packet<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:29.010> how<00:03:29.220> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the Splenda packet and that's how you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.010 
the Splenda packet and that's how you
make<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.580> work<00:03:29.730> all<00:03:30.150> three<00:03:30.420> times<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.959> I'm

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
make it work all three times so I'm

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.260 
make it work all three times so I'm
gonna<00:03:31.170> go<00:03:31.290> over<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.680> once<00:03:31.860> more<00:03:32.209> if<00:03:33.209> she

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
gonna go over it once more if she

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.979 
gonna go over it once more if she
immediately<00:03:33.780> first<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.950> say<00:03:35.190> hand<00:03:35.970> me<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.450> if

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
immediately first you say hand me one if

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.960 
immediately first you say hand me one if
she<00:03:37.230> immediately<00:03:37.440> hands<00:03:37.950> me<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> correct<00:03:38.489> one

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
she immediately hands me the correct one

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.990 
she immediately hands me the correct one
the<00:03:39.270> trick<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.690> over<00:03:40.020> if<00:03:40.709> she<00:03:40.800> doesn't<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.610> say

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
say you picked the Splenda packet look

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.350 
say you picked the Splenda packet look
at<00:03:48.150> my<00:03:48.300> prediction<00:03:48.870> if<00:03:49.230> she<00:03:49.800> doesn't<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.550> say

look we're left with a Splenda packet

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.050 
look we're left with a Splenda packet
and<00:03:54.900> another<00:03:55.620> thing<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> remember<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.820> you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.460 
and another thing to remember is you
want<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.360> make<00:03:57.510> sure<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.080> tell<00:03:58.320> your

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
want to make sure that you tell your

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.220 
want to make sure that you tell your
audience<00:03:58.920> where<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.700> prediction<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.450> before

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
audience where the prediction is before

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.620 
audience where the prediction is before
the<00:04:01.350> trick<00:04:01.620> starts<00:04:02.100> otherwise<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.480> might

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the trick starts otherwise you might

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.630 
the trick starts otherwise you might
think<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.230> have<00:04:04.380> one<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.250> another

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
think that I have one here and another

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640 
think that I have one here and another
one<00:04:06.060> under<00:04:06.300> here<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.110> another<00:04:07.380> one<00:04:07.500> there

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
one under here and another one there

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.470 
one under here and another one there
here<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.370> want<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.610> be<00:04:08.700> very<00:04:08.730> clear<00:04:09.330> where

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
here so you want to be very clear where

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.990 
here so you want to be very clear where
the<00:04:09.600> prediction<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.230> ahead<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.590> time

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
the prediction is ahead of time

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.060 
the prediction is ahead of time
