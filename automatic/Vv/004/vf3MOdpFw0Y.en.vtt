so<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.800> lab<00:00:02.100> 3<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.760> axial<00:00:03.210> and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
so this is lab 3 the axial and

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.690 
so this is lab 3 the axial and
appendicular<00:00:03.560> skeleton<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:05.339> are<00:00:05.460> going

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
appendicular skeleton and we are going

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.280 
appendicular skeleton and we are going
to<00:00:05.790> look<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.060> part<00:00:06.299> two<00:00:06.509> million<00:00:07.049> from

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290

skeleton

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640 
skeleton
and<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:08.760> account<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.200> here

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
and here we have account so here here

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.480 
and here we have account so here here
are<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.920> various<00:00:11.570> vertebrae<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.889> first<00:00:14.250> one

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
are the various vertebrae the first one

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.880 
are the various vertebrae the first one
is<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> Atlas<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.630> think<00:00:15.839> Atlas<00:00:16.289> holds<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
is the Atlas I think Atlas holds up a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.400 
is the Atlas I think Atlas holds up a
globe<00:00:17.130> Atlas<00:00:18.029> holds<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> head<00:00:18.990> which<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
globe Atlas holds up the head which is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.910 
globe Atlas holds up the head which is
big<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.920> round<00:00:20.130> then<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> access

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
big and round then we have the access

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.080 
big and round then we have the access
the<00:00:22.920> neck<00:00:23.160> vertebrae<00:00:23.609> which<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:23.880> called<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the neck vertebrae which are called the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.679 
the neck vertebrae which are called the
cervical<00:00:24.570> vertebrae<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:27.180> thoracic

cervical vertebrae the thoracic

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.060 
cervical vertebrae the thoracic
vertebrae<00:00:28.609> over<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> huge<00:00:31.070> spinous

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
vertebrae over here with a huge spinous

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.410 
vertebrae over here with a huge spinous
process<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.960> anticlinal<00:00:35.149> vertebrae<00:00:36.149> which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
process the anticlinal vertebrae which

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.299 
process the anticlinal vertebrae which
is<00:00:36.600> basically<00:00:36.989> where<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> vertebrae<00:00:37.770> change

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is basically where the vertebrae change

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 
is basically where the vertebrae change
direction<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> spinous<00:00:39.899> processes<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
direction or the spinous processes of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.119 
direction or the spinous processes of
the<00:00:41.129> vertebrae<00:00:41.160> change<00:00:41.670> direction<00:00:43.129> these

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the vertebrae change direction these

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.000 
the vertebrae change direction these
ones<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> lumbar<00:00:45.510> vertebrae<00:00:45.980> with<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
ones are the lumbar vertebrae with a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.049 
ones are the lumbar vertebrae with a
huge<00:00:47.370> psychopathic<00:00:47.969> C's<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.629> LA<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
huge psychopathic C's and the LA and

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.400 
huge psychopathic C's and the LA and
between<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> pelvis<00:00:51.539> we've<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> series<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
between the pelvis we've got a series of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
between the pelvis we've got a series of
fused<00:00:52.770> vertebrae<00:00:52.890> called<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.850> sacral

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
fused vertebrae called the sacral

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
fused vertebrae called the sacral
vertebrae<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> remaining

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
vertebrae and then the remaining

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
vertebrae and then the remaining
vertebrae<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> caudal<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.840> tail

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
vertebrae are the caudal or tail

vertebrae are the caudal or tail
vertebra<00:00:58.910> page<00:00:59.910> 88<00:01:00.270> goes<00:01:00.600> into<00:01:00.840> details<00:01:01.230> about

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
vertebra page 88 goes into details about

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
vertebra page 88 goes into details about
the<00:01:02.969> differences<00:01:03.449> between<00:01:03.510> structures<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the differences between structures of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
the differences between structures of
these<00:01:04.589> vertebrae<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.420> over

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
these vertebrae but I'm going to go over

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
these vertebrae but I'm going to go over
just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.020> couple<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.409> big<00:01:07.650> ones<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:10.500> Atlas

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
just a couple of big ones so the Atlas

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
just a couple of big ones so the Atlas
has<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.580> thin

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
has a very thin

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
has a very thin
Centrum<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.580> hold<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.000> what

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Centrum and it's what hold it's what

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
Centrum and it's what hold it's what
holds<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.229> head<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> next<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.119> down<00:01:18.299> the

axis has a music like in front here the
axis<00:01:22.740> has<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:24.710> dens<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> sticks

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
axis has a a dens that kind of sticks

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.170 
axis has a a dens that kind of sticks
out<00:01:27.409> towards<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.210> cranium<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> thoracic

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
out towards the cranium the thoracic

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.920 
out towards the cranium the thoracic
vertebrae<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.920> oh<00:01:35.220> sorry<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> cervical

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
vertebrae here oh sorry the cervical

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.789 
vertebrae here oh sorry the cervical
vertebrae<00:01:37.640> have<00:01:38.720> transverse<00:01:39.720> foramina<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
vertebrae have transverse foramina so

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
vertebrae have transverse foramina so
these<00:01:40.950> holes<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.079> spinous

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
these holes right here the spinous

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
these holes right here the spinous
processes<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.430> holes<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.060> nerve

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
processes these holes are where nerve

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.719 
processes these holes are where nerve
cords<00:01:46.970> go<00:01:47.970> through<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:50.549> thoracic<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:52.290> an

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
cords go through the thoracic have an

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.109 
cords go through the thoracic have an
extremely<00:01:53.840> tall<00:01:54.840> spinous<00:01:55.560> process<00:01:56.100> which<00:01:56.909> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
extremely tall spinous process which is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.789 
extremely tall spinous process which is
the<00:01:57.240> point<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> attachment<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.140> many<00:01:58.409> muscles

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the point of attachment for many muscles

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.370 
the point of attachment for many muscles
that<00:01:58.950> hold<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> head<00:01:59.520> up

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.660 

the<00:02:03.380> anticlinal<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.160> where<00:02:04.340> they<00:02:04.430> change

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the anticlinal is where they change

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.520 
the anticlinal is where they change
direction<00:02:06.970> which<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.260> this<00:02:09.260> one<00:02:10.540> then<00:02:11.540> we<00:02:12.290> have

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
direction which is this one then we have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.740 
direction which is this one then we have
the<00:02:12.740> lumbar<00:02:13.370> vertebrae<00:02:13.400> which<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.390> one<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.720> a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the lumbar vertebrae which this one is a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.610 
the lumbar vertebrae which this one is a
good<00:02:14.930> example<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.500> these<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.100> huge<00:02:17.620> lateral

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
good example of these have huge lateral

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.430 
good example of these have huge lateral
psychopathy<00:02:19.280> pieces<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:19.760> are<00:02:19.910> basically

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
psychopathy pieces which are basically

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.610 
psychopathy pieces which are basically
modified<00:02:21.440> ribs<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:23.170> here<00:02:24.170> we<00:02:24.320> have<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
modified ribs and here we have the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.590 
modified ribs and here we have the
sacrum<00:02:25.100> which<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.430> set<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.880> fused<00:02:26.390> vertebrae

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
sacrum which is a set of fused vertebrae

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.730 
sacrum which is a set of fused vertebrae
and<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:28.280> after<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> sacrum<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> caudal

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
and then after the sacrum is the caudal

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.650 
and then after the sacrum is the caudal
we<00:02:30.740> are<00:02:30.830> also<00:02:31.070> going<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.750> look<00:02:32.750> at<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.490> sternum

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
we are also going to look at the sternum

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.080 
we are also going to look at the sternum
which<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.870> abdomen<00:02:36.350> which<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.130> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
which one abdomen which is this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.290 
which one abdomen which is this
structure<00:02:38.690> right<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:40.300> they're

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
structure right here and they're

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.070 
structure right here and they're
composed<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.020> series<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.650> sternum

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
composed of a series this is the sternum

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.590 
composed of a series this is the sternum
which<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.650> series<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.550> bony<00:02:50.330> elements

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
which is a series of bony elements

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.320 
which is a series of bony elements
called<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.260> Jana<00:02:51.680> Bray<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.430> first<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:53.120> which

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
called this Jana Bray the first of which

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.070 
called this Jana Bray the first of which
this<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.709> manubrium<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.930> is

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
this one is the manubrium and this is

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.600 
this one is the manubrium and this is
where<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.320> clavicle<00:02:57.770> articulates<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:58.520> on

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
where the clavicle articulates but on

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.670 
where the clavicle articulates but on
our<00:02:58.820> specimen<00:02:59.330> we're<00:02:59.540> missing<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.170> clavicle

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
our specimen we're missing a clavicle

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.420 
our specimen we're missing a clavicle
so<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.970> last<00:03:02.150> part<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.720> part<00:03:03.080> two<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.890> we're

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
so the last part of part two is we're

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.870 
so the last part of part two is we're
going<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.640> look<00:03:04.730> at<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.910> rib<00:03:05.920> come<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.070> this<00:03:07.220> one

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.800 

find<00:03:10.880> where<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.600> rib<00:03:11.780> is<00:03:12.050> there<00:03:13.040> we<00:03:13.190> go

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
find where the rib is there we go

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.050 
find where the rib is there we go
so<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.410> rib<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:15.950> an<00:03:16.100> extremely<00:03:16.610> small

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
so on the rib this is an extremely small

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.130 
so on the rib this is an extremely small
rib<00:03:17.690> we<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.250> but<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:19.370> have<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:20.209> part<00:03:20.750> that's

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
rib we have but we have this part that's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.330 
rib we have but we have this part that's
called<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.680> tuberculoma<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:24.110> there<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.070> on

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
called the tuberculoma so there it is on

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.240 
called the tuberculoma so there it is on
the<00:03:26.030> diagram<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.810> this<00:03:27.290> articulates<00:03:28.010> with

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
the diagram and this articulates with

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.310 
the diagram and this articulates with
the<00:03:28.310> transverse<00:03:28.880> processes<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.780> TT

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
the transverse processes so TT

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.729 
the transverse processes so TT
tubercular<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:30.980> transverse<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.900> the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
tubercular and transverse and the

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.810 
tubercular and transverse and the
capitulum<00:03:34.280> which<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.600> part<00:03:35.989> here<00:03:36.050> and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
capitulum which is this part here and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.390 
capitulum which is this part here and
that<00:03:38.500> articulates<00:03:39.500> with<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.769> centrum<00:03:40.220> so

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
that articulates with the centrum so

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.090 
that articulates with the centrum so
cece<00:03:40.910> capitulum<00:03:41.330> centrum<00:03:41.870> now<00:03:42.860> we're<00:03:43.010> going

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
cece capitulum centrum now we're going

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.490 
cece capitulum centrum now we're going
to<00:03:43.160> move<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.970> part<00:03:44.750> 6<00:03:45.019> which<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
to move on to part 6 which is the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.850 
to move on to part 6 which is the
mammalian<00:03:45.890> appendicular<00:03:46.700> structure<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:47.750> you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
mammalian appendicular structure if you

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.040 
mammalian appendicular structure if you
look<00:03:48.860> at<00:03:48.980> Dropbox<00:03:49.250> there's<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.360> couple<00:03:50.930> of

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
look at Dropbox there's a couple of

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.660 
look at Dropbox there's a couple of
pictures<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.440> go<00:03:51.709> into<00:03:51.860> detail<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:52.489> we're

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
pictures that go into detail but we're

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.830 
pictures that go into detail but we're
going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.880> just<00:03:53.060> look<00:03:53.150> at<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.390> larger<00:03:53.810> picture

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
going to just look at the larger picture

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.660 
going to just look at the larger picture
right<00:03:54.410> here<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.700> one

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
right here so this one

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.110 
right here so this one
start<00:04:00.630> low<00:04:00.780> collateral<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:03.270> here<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.810> have

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
start low collateral so here we have

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.930 
start low collateral so here we have
orbit<00:04:06.120> with<00:04:07.020> is't<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.860> mandible<00:04:08.400> composes

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
orbit with is't the mandible composes

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.550 
orbit with is't the mandible composes
the<00:04:09.060> jaw<00:04:09.240> bones<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.630> looked<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.930> earlier<00:04:10.290> so

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
the jaw bones we looked at earlier so

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.370
