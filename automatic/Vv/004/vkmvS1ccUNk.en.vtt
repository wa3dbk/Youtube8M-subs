I think that this WrestleMania 30 was
sort<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.389> like<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.539> throwaway<00:04:52.930> giveaway<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
sort of like a throwaway giveaway to the

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.460 
sort of like a throwaway giveaway to the
