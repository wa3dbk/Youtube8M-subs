clean we're trying to minimize oils and
such<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> typically<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> those<00:01:24.360> from

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

sticker working then I think we're ready
there<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.729> go

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
there we go

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
there we go
I'm<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.780> pull<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.740> sticker<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:36.920> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.109 
I'm gonna just pull the sticker off and
look<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.340> those<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.640> holes<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
look at that all those little holes and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
look at that all those little holes and
everything<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.369> trick

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
everything and now really the big trick

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
everything and now really the big trick
with<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.000> things<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> line<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
with these things is to line stuff up so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
with these things is to line stuff up so
I'm<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.369> start<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.090> lining<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> corner

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I'm gonna start by lining up the corner

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.469 
I'm gonna start by lining up the corner
that<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:50.250> holes<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.790> such<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that has the little holes and such so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.530 
that has the little holes and such so
let's<00:01:51.720> see

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.360
