00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
make sure that when you're contouring

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
make sure that when you're contouring
your<00:01:10.020> nose<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> straight

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
your nose you're going in a straight

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.240 
your nose you're going in a straight
line<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.850> follows<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> tip<00:01:13.110> some<00:01:13.860> people

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
line that follows to the tip some people

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
line that follows to the tip some people
go<00:01:15.119> straight<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.840> towards<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> outer

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
go straight down towards the outer

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.399 
go straight down towards the outer
nostril<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.409> triangular

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
nostril and it can get very triangular

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.940 
nostril and it can get very triangular
looking<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.820> keeps<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> follows<00:01:22.740> its

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
looking this keeps it so it follows its

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.569 
looking this keeps it so it follows its
natural<00:01:23.430> bone<00:01:23.670> structure<00:01:31.009> I'm<00:01:32.009> also<00:01:32.280> being

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
natural bone structure I'm also being

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
natural bone structure I'm also being
careful<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.299> make<00:01:34.170> sure<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.439> blending<00:01:34.740> out

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
careful to make sure I'm blending out

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.060 
careful to make sure I'm blending out
the<00:01:35.189> line<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the line so that you can't see it you

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.780 
the line so that you can't see it you
just<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> shadow

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.430 

you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.970> also<00:01:45.120> round<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:46.050> tip<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.410> your

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
you can also round out the tip of your

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.680 
you can also round out the tip of your
nose<00:01:46.710> depending<00:01:47.400> on<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:47.640> nose<00:01:47.850> shape<00:01:48.180> and

nose depending on your nose shape and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.080 
nose depending on your nose shape and
you<00:01:48.900> can<00:01:49.050> turn<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.620> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.980> bit<00:01:50.250> by

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you can turn it up a little bit by

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can turn it up a little bit by
darkening<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.990> underside<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.740> nose<00:01:56.210> if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
darkening the underside of your nose if

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.150 
darkening the underside of your nose if
you<00:01:57.420> wanted<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
you wanted to have a little bit more of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.520 
you wanted to have a little bit more of
a<00:01:59.280> dip<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.820> darken<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.870> just<00:02:01.140> above<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
a dip you can darken it just above the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.830 
a dip you can darken it just above the
tip<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.370> nose

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.859 

now<00:02:06.840> using<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.759> bottom<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.149> brush<00:02:09.479> I'm

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
now using the bottom of my brush I'm

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.890 
now using the bottom of my brush I'm
pushing<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> fibers<00:02:11.460> into<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.090> cheekbone<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
pushing the fibers into my cheekbone and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.790

blending from there my bottom of the
brush<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.280> mean<00:02:17.459> where<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> hairs<00:02:18.120> start<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
brush I mean where the hairs start to

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.270 
brush I mean where the hairs start to
come<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:19.350> letting<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.770> tips<00:02:20.040> just

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
come out and I'm letting the tips just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
come out and I'm letting the tips just
lightly<00:02:20.700> blend<00:02:21.030> everything<00:02:21.270> together<00:02:22.220> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
lightly blend everything together this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.880 
lightly blend everything together this
will<00:02:23.459> build<00:02:24.000> up<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.240> color<00:02:24.540> lightly<00:02:25.200> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
will build up the color lightly but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:35.420 
will build up the color lightly but
still<00:02:26.190> give<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> nice<00:02:26.670> shadow<00:02:34.010> now<00:02:35.010> instead<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
still give a nice shadow now instead of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.310 
still give a nice shadow now instead of
just<00:02:35.790> carrying<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> color<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.200> way

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
just carrying the color all the way

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.630 
just carrying the color all the way
through<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.860> straight<00:02:38.160> line<00:02:38.400> I'm

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
through in the straight line I'm

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.729 
through in the straight line I'm
actually<00:02:38.820> dropping<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.630> down<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.200> before

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
actually dropping it down just before

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.400 
actually dropping it down just before
the<00:02:41.340> edge<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:41.700> mouth

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
the edge of my mouth

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.740 
the edge of my mouth
to<00:02:43.410> create<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:44.070> new<00:02:44.630> cheekbone

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.740 

and<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:56.280> always<00:02:56.610> nice<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.030> contour

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and it's always nice to contour

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.460 
and it's always nice to contour
underneath<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.650> jaw<00:02:58.890> line<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> make<00:03:01.440> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
underneath the jaw line just to make a
