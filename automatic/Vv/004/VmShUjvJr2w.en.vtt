00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.880
 Hello, I want to present to your inspection 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.129
 knife and wood folding which I did 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.749
 myself 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:16.330
 to make a knife 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:21.250
 It took about seven hours in total 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 the complexity of the tree of and the light of which 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 make this knife is pine on 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:43.300
 handles and ash blade what is very 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.340
 it was interesting that what Iâ€™m for 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:53.199
 so afraid it is that it is straight that the blade 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 will hang out very, very much so 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:05.379
 here to bend but this is not even if 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.100
 this tree is not observed by 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:15.810
 about the fixation mechanism, then you can 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 say such here there is such a thing 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.510
 she put it here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:54.420
 That's the way a matchstick is also 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 knife is inserted like this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:09.899
 pretty big for folding 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:15.840
 Here for example my second knife you can 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.200
 see a big difference you blade length 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.510
 and width 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.110
 about the exact blade it turned out 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 about four millimeters in principle 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.630
 much for a folding knife what 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.630
