it's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.900> cute<00:02:04.140> wig<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:06.479> say<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
it's a cute wig and I say it's a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.630 
it's a cute wig and I say it's a
must-have<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.950> collection<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
like waves like this I thought this was

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
like waves like this I thought this was
a<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.340> sexy<00:02:11.700> look<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
a really really sexy look and this is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.640 
a really really sexy look and this is
the<00:02:13.320> picture<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.980> had<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.940> display<00:02:15.650> for

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
the picture that they had on display for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040 
the picture that they had on display for
this<00:02:16.980> particular<00:02:17.190> way<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.510> knew<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> had<00:02:19.020> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
this particular way and I knew I had to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.440 
this particular way and I knew I had to
have<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.740> was<00:02:20.610> hopeful<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.060> i<00:02:21.209> could

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
have it and was hopeful that i could

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
have it and was hopeful that i could
probably<00:02:21.890> duplicate<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.100> style<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
probably duplicate this style and if I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.360 
probably duplicate this style and if I
could<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.110> great<00:02:25.350> buy<00:02:25.680> now

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
could that it would be a great buy now

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.729 
could that it would be a great buy now
to<00:02:26.910> go<00:02:27.090> outside<00:02:27.270> i<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:27.930> probably<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.410> some

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
to go outside i would probably put some

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.300 
to go outside i would probably put some
hairspray<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> help<00:02:30.980> control<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
hairspray on it just to help control the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
hairspray on it just to help control the
bang<00:02:32.850> especially<00:02:33.630> from<00:02:33.959> falling<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:34.530> face

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
bang especially from falling in my face

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.520 
bang especially from falling in my face
and<00:02:35.180> maybe<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.810> give<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> little

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and maybe just to give this a little

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
and maybe just to give this a little
lift<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.550> keep<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.940> lift<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.540> i

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
lift to it to keep the lift in it but i

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.949 
lift to it to keep the lift in it but i
