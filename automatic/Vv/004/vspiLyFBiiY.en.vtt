00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello girls to another video lesson from 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 lord x takes my name is maria and now 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.290
 I'm just dancing 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.549
 Let's learn how to stick the decisive blanket 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.000
 in the slipper 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.070
 we take off the belt to facilitate 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.449
 You'll get a piece of the blanket measured. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.170
 so much that you put in the slipper 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.810
 this one we have here is cut 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 removes the paper he already comes with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.390
 sticker puts on the slipper 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.860
 let's take it as a reference for ever 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.860
 stays the same as the other 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:58.559
 Colo just to fix it better to cut 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.059
 It's always good to come to the slipper that you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 can see how much you are going to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.210
 cut if you put it that way you do not 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.450

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.020

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.770
 front and put the slipper that way 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.440
 so you can paste both of them in the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.060
