like<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:47.070> matter<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> move<00:01:48.720> says

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

like it don't matter this move says
months<00:01:49.350> old<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:49.979> anything<00:01:50.399> new<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.000> he's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
months old so if anything new that he's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.510 
months old so if anything new that he's
done<00:01:51.659> being<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.259> main<00:01:52.470> roster<00:01:52.740> actually<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
done being on the main roster actually a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.200 
done being on the main roster actually a
little<00:01:53.790> previous<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.689> i<00:01:55.790> don't<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:57.060> he

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
little previous to that i don't think he

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.950 
little previous to that i don't think he
has<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.149> probably<00:02:00.149> will<00:02:00.299> need<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> add<00:02:00.689> nothing

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.010 
has so probably will need to add nothing
and<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:01.409> dunno<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.280> i<00:02:02.460> remember<00:02:02.670> correctly<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and i dunno if i remember correctly that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380 
and i dunno if i remember correctly that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
look the diving elbow drops a finisher

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.499 
look the diving elbow drops a finisher
because<00:02:07.170> he<00:02:07.320> was<00:02:07.469> using<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
