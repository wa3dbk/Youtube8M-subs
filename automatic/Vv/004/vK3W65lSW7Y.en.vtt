okay<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.290> segment<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.890> to

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
okay in this segment we're going to

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.860 
okay in this segment we're going to
cover<00:00:02.100> installing<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.730> tensioner<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.389> this

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
cover installing the tensioner and this

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.889 
cover installing the tensioner and this
is<00:00:04.020> really<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> crucial<00:00:05.029> part<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.359> change

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
is really a crucial part of the change

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.040 
is really a crucial part of the change
system<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.519> real<00:00:08.790> crucial<00:00:09.179> because

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
system and it is real crucial because

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.320 
system and it is real crucial because
it's<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:10.380> keeps<00:00:10.620> all<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> slack<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
it's what keeps all the slack out of the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.120 
it's what keeps all the slack out of the
chain<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> chain<00:00:13.049> fitting<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.860> tight

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
chain and the chain fitting is tight

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.340 
chain and the chain fitting is tight
it's<00:00:14.400> possible<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.000> attire<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.809> tighter<00:00:16.109> that

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it's possible to attire the tighter that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's possible to attire the tighter that

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
chain fits to the tire the better it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.090

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that go and if the chains come off they

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.180 
that go and if the chains come off they
can<00:00:57.180> wrap<00:00:57.390> around<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> drive<00:00:58.109> axels<00:00:58.649> cause

can wrap around the drive axels cause

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
can wrap around the drive axels cause
all<00:00:59.520> kinds<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.149> other<00:01:00.329> problems<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.780> for

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
all kinds of other problems this for

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.550 
all kinds of other problems this for
things<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.470> live<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> tricky<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:06.049> okay<00:01:07.049> what

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
things you live is tricky here okay what

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
things you live is tricky here okay what
I'm<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.880> it's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I'm going to do now is you can see it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.810 
I'm going to do now is you can see it's
kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.110> Center<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.729> or

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
kind of out of Center out around more or

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340 
kind of out of Center out around more or
less<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.200> some

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
less I'm just going to make some

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.670 
less I'm just going to make some
adjustments<00:01:14.299> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> slide<00:01:16.140> everything<00:01:16.590> in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
adjustments kind of slide everything in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.179 
adjustments kind of slide everything in
a<00:01:16.740> position<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> move<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> chain<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:22.890> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
a position and move the chain around so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
a position and move the chain around so
it<00:01:23.310> gets<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> centered<00:01:24.049> reaching

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it gets good and centered reaching

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
it gets good and centered reaching
around<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> back<00:01:25.500> side<00:01:25.740> checking<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> inner

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
around the back side checking the inner

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
around the back side checking the inner
bead<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.630> chain<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:29.340> comes<00:01:29.610> around

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bead of the chain that comes around

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
bead of the chain that comes around
you'll<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> nice<00:01:30.420> circle<00:01:30.960> loop<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you'll have a nice circle loop on the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.200 
you'll have a nice circle loop on the
back<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:33.079> make<00:01:34.079> sure<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.500> nice<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.680> tight

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
back side make sure it's nice and tight

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.190 
back side make sure it's nice and tight
you'll<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:36.960> any

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you'll want to get up and get any

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960 
you'll want to get up and get any
inspection<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> front<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.490> inside

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
inspection from the front on the inside

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
inspection from the front on the inside
make<00:01:39.630> sure<00:01:39.810> there's<00:01:40.140> nothing<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.100> way

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
make sure there's nothing in this way

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.840 
make sure there's nothing in this way
it's<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> hit<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.390> anything<00:01:43.850> then

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it's not going to hit on anything then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.429 
it's not going to hit on anything then
they<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.090> slowly<00:01:45.329> work<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> chain<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.079> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
they just slowly work to chain around so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.460 
they just slowly work to chain around so
it<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:47.430> fits<00:01:47.759> nice<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> uniform<00:01:48.509> basically

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it all fits nice and uniform basically

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.700 
it all fits nice and uniform basically
all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.540> tie-down<00:01:51.540> points<00:01:51.960> where<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> links

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
all the tie-down points where the links

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.920 
all the tie-down points where the links
come<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:54.000> pretty<00:01:54.299> much<00:01:54.390> centered<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
come in are all pretty much centered in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.170 
come in are all pretty much centered in
the<00:01:54.990> same<00:01:55.200> location<00:01:55.710> around<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> tire<00:01:56.340> you're

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the same location around the tire you're
