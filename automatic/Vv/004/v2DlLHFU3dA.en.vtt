balls and we made one that it shoots
beer<00:02:13.069> cans<00:02:13.340> full<00:02:13.549> of<00:02:13.670> concrete<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.200> when

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
beer cans full of concrete and then when

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.040 
beer cans full of concrete and then when
I<00:02:15.439> realized<00:02:16.269> bowling<00:02:17.269> balls<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.749> all

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
I realized bowling balls for all

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.760 
I realized bowling balls for all
same<00:02:18.170> diameter<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:23.770> yeah

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
same diameter you know I you know yeah

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
same diameter you know I you know yeah
that's<00:02:25.100> yeah<00:02:25.490> that's<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.600> know<00:02:26.720> that's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that's yeah that's what you know that's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.910 
that's yeah that's what you know that's
kind<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> things<00:02:27.740> that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
kind of one of the things that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.680 
kind of one of the things that
determines<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.030> when<00:02:29.270> you're<00:02:29.420> thinking

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
determines you know when you're thinking

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.820 
determines you know when you're thinking
about<00:02:29.870> building<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> cannon<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.650> better

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
about building the cannon you better

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.990 
about building the cannon you better
think<00:02:31.070> about<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.490> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.850> shoot

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
think about what you're going to shoot

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.400 
think about what you're going to shoot
out<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.330> made<00:02:41.660> charges

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
out and made charges

00:02:42.410 --> 00:03:07.330 
out and made charges
that's<00:02:42.650> impressive<00:03:05.860> Franklin<00:03:06.860> gather<00:03:07.040> we're

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
that's impressive Franklin gather we're

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.830 
that's impressive Franklin gather we're
here<00:03:07.520> first<00:03:08.000> time<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.330> shot<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.900> right<00:03:13.270> yeah

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
ones about swirly plastic Wednesday they

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.550 
ones about swirly plastic Wednesday they
usually<00:03:40.100> aren't<00:03:40.430> as<00:03:40.670> good<00:03:41.800> block<00:03:44.290> these<00:03:45.290> old

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.270 

these<00:05:20.000> Chinese<00:05:20.330> fuse<00:05:20.870> isn't<00:05:21.169> very<00:05:21.530> consistent

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
these Chinese fuse isn't very consistent

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.800 
these Chinese fuse isn't very consistent
so<00:05:22.490> every<00:05:22.760> now<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.030> then<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:23.270> get<00:05:23.390> surprised

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
so every now and then you get surprised

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.670 
so every now and then you get surprised
but<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:26.030> usually<00:05:26.480> it's<00:05:26.660> more<00:05:26.930> like<00:05:27.169> three<00:05:27.560> or

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
but but usually it's more like three or

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680 
but but usually it's more like three or
four<00:05:27.740> minutes<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.220> I've<00:05:28.730> seen<00:05:29.030> it<00:05:29.210> happen<00:05:29.240> as

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
four minutes so I've seen it happen as

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:37.930 
four minutes so I've seen it happen as
soon<00:05:29.720> as<00:05:30.050> soon<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.410> minute<00:05:30.770> am

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:06:12.520 

I<00:05:46.960> can't<00:06:10.300> step<00:06:11.300> in<00:06:11.480> and<00:06:11.660> far-field

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
I can't step in and far-field

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.520 
I can't step in and far-field
see<00:06:13.520> way<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:14.210> way<00:06:14.450> up<00:06:14.750> there<00:06:15.050> there's<00:06:15.320> some

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
see way that way up there there's some

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.350 
see way that way up there there's some
dust<00:06:15.770> in<00:06:16.010> that<00:06:16.040> field<00:06:16.460> I<00:06:16.640> think<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:17.120> might<00:06:17.330> be

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
dust in that field I think that might be

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.990 
dust in that field I think that might be
where<00:06:17.660> it<00:06:17.750> hit
