00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.299
 mold and bacteria our climate 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.580
 The unpleasant condition comes about 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.060
 today there is a tip from me like you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.529
 These can be removed for cleaning 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 and disinfect our air conditioning 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.380
 we take a climate fresh and like that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.500
 I'll show you that now 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.160
 wait let's just leave our car 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 running, turn off the air conditioning 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 the ventilation has gone completely hot 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.170
 The reason the vaporizer must be for this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.030
 action to be completely dried and how 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 it goes on show you the same 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 so after we got our damn 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.090
 have now completely dried follows 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 the next one works as follows 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 We now switch our air conditioning 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.460
 Once on circulating air it is very important 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 and wear our fan once on cold 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.610
 after all her windows at the car 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350
 completely closed the car completely 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.979
 is tight 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.650
 now the faith will shake then 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.840
 let's put the evil dream in and 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.840
 drink yourself absorbed 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.079
 yes, just now seen as the cleaner 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.939
 she shoots out of the box 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.799
 rocket are therefore excluded and 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.840
 distributed in the entire interior 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.210
 and also in the heating shafts 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.009
 distributed as we continue we see 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.500
 right after we got our vehicles 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:53.729
 have been allowed to open 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.729
 plucked and know draws to the outside 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.690
 yes, so you can tell 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.560
 you can breathe freely in the moment 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.909
 very pleasant 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.909
 not very refreshing 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.500
