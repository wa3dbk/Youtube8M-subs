 interesting countrymen of the next hero 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.050
 The plot prompted us to Elizabeth 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.509
 Vereshchagin 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.790
 I once attended a wedding where 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 the newlyweds released into the sky the birds of the world and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.810
 happiness doves and it seemed to me 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.570
 interesting traditions as it turned out later 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 father of the groom himself bred doves and me 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.710
 white mountains 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 connoisseurs of collectors who today 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 can be counted on the fingers of the film crew 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.480
 Belogorie group of the world went 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 straight to the dovecote and made sure that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.980
 for our hero, breeding birds is not 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.980
 just a song and music of the soul 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 this unique sound of flapping wings 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.360
 Edward Firsov will not confuse pigeons with anything 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 the wild breed the buzzard of his lively collection 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 unpretentiousness unique flight 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 abilities and beauty but for now the region 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 music master who created them 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 somersault that is, it is also like a tumbler 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.290

 Do not name Fighting 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.890
 says only the ability because of the wings 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
 and the air and what tricks they write out in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.270

 snouty riotous acrobats so edward 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.969
 Firsov tried to describe it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.350
 extraordinary sight words like they 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.040
 fly then starts to rise 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.710
 vertically 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.960
 at the same time they knock very strongly with wings and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.450
 doing cottage cheese again knocking again does 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.819
 somersault and that's well in general we sort of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.160
 his excitement the more he the higher he 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.230

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500
 pets bad luck 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.870
 but any of his 2 Krylov 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 ward learns from a thousand because 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.380
 each bird has its own character and habits 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.810
 that they are not uncommon 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 and get exactly aksakal maybe 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.250
 Klitschko there can be Baba 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 old-timers like an old pigeon and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 he walks such an important fool there 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.540
 there could be something else there 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.060
 to be the reasons why this nickname appeared 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.820
 He can there other Piskunov feed 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.250

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.140
 1 some white there in the tail of his first 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.769
 well we call each name we give it 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.910
 necessarily 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:12.130
 and began the personal story of Edward 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.380
 Firsova called love and doves with 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.480
 the distant seventies then still being 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.790
 as a boy he not only loved to drive 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
 these birds on the roofs well and with might and main carried away 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.799
 I want them separately for breeding 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.630
 tell the parents what they are allowed to 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.950
 do it because it's all done 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.100
 in the attics in the shared holes to be 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.280
 naked could go in and get out that is some 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.170
 damage to the dwelling reason of the father in his time ps 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.720
 thank you so much for their experience 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.000

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.739
 boyish dream of her own 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.510
 own large nurseries 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.480
 maybe it influenced in due time 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.760
 on the choice of future profession Edward Firsov 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 became veterinarians over time along with 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.690
 friends and like-minded people built 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.609
 these houses for their pets and began 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.950
 collect a collection of deep rocks 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.180
 perhaps the greatest happiness today 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.489
 for pigeon breeders 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.920
 release the birds into the sky and watch them 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.410
 circling over your head this is the real 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.600
