lot of different ways and I think my
players<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.500> it<00:00:35.739> because<00:00:36.579> we<00:00:36.940> can<00:00:37.120> change<00:00:37.329> it

need to get down technique they need to

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.520 
need to get down technique they need to
make<00:00:55.420> sure<00:00:55.449> they<00:00:55.690> know<00:00:55.839> exactly<00:00:55.929> what<00:00:56.499> a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
make sure they know exactly what a

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.009 
make sure they know exactly what a
natural<00:00:56.979> pitch<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.489> but<00:00:58.479> then<00:00:58.600> as<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.839> season

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
natural pitch is but then as the season

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.119 
natural pitch is but then as the season
goes<00:00:59.409> on

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
goes on

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.979 
goes on
I<00:01:00.159> want<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:00.850> natural<00:01:01.329> pitch<00:01:01.539> drill<00:01:01.870> to

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
I want that natural pitch drill to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.530 
I want that natural pitch drill to
become<00:01:02.260> more<00:01:02.499> competitive<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:03.339> want<00:01:04.269> all<00:01:04.510> of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
and I'll again collapse timeframes I'll

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.400 
and I'll again collapse timeframes I'll
show<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.710> natural<00:01:24.250> pitch<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.540> while<00:01:26.200> we're

while we're doing natural pitch now

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.930 
while we're doing natural pitch now
we're<00:01:32.020> going<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.200> train<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.740> ball<00:01:32.950> handler<00:01:33.340> so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
we're going to train the ball handler so

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.920 
we're going to train the ball handler so
many<00:01:34.120> different<00:01:34.420> things<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.660> could<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.900> to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
many different things you could do to

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.230 
many different things you could do to
collapse<00:01:35.350> all<00:01:35.590> these<00:01:35.740> now<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.090> this

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
collapse all these now you can do this

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.170 
collapse all these now you can do this
with<00:01:37.480> safety<00:01:38.050> valve<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.740> can<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:39.040> with<00:01:39.280> corner

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
with safety valve you can do with corner

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.580 
with safety valve you can do with corner
come<00:01:40.420> back<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.020> without<00:01:41.260> there's<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
come back you can do without there's a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.140 
come back you can do without there's a
you<00:01:41.950> know<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.100> bunch<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.490> different<00:01:42.790> drills<00:01:42.940> for

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
each one but I'm giving you the example

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.280 
each one but I'm giving you the example
of<00:01:44.770> natural<00:01:45.250> pitch<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:46.570> maybe<00:01:46.750> this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
of natural pitch on you know maybe this

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.900 
of natural pitch on you know maybe this
is<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.500> shoot<00:01:47.770> around<00:01:47.860> drill<00:01:48.310> I'm<00:01:48.490> starting

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
is a shoot around drill I'm starting

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.460 
is a shoot around drill I'm starting
with<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.180> when<00:01:49.390> I'm<00:01:49.480> building<00:01:49.840> up<00:01:49.990> this<00:01:50.230> one

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
with this when I'm building up this one

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.130 
with this when I'm building up this one
once<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:51.130> get<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.520> implementing<00:01:52.420> my<00:01:52.630> defense

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
once I get to implementing my defense

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.290 
once I get to implementing my defense
then<00:01:53.380> my<00:01:53.560> focus<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.340> closeout<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.090> this

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
then my focus is on the closeout in this

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.910 
then my focus is on the closeout in this
drill<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.810> I'm<00:01:55.900> still<00:01:56.140> get<00:01:56.320> natural<00:01:56.740> pitch

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
drill but I'm still get natural pitch

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.820 
drill but I'm still get natural pitch
work<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.820> those<00:01:58.090> are<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.480> few<00:01:58.510> ideas<00:01:58.830> on

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
work so those are just a few ideas on

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.650 
work so those are just a few ideas on
how<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.040> can<00:02:00.370> be<00:02:00.490> creative<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.450> use

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
how you can be creative and you can use

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.810 
how you can be creative and you can use
those<00:02:02.020> throughout<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.980> implementation

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
those throughout the implementation

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.270 
those throughout the implementation
process<00:02:04.510> let's<00:02:05.320> just<00:02:05.470> start<00:02:05.650> right<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:06.100> let
