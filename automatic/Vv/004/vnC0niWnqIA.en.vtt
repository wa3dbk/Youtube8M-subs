drawing aids but really it's the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
drawing aids but really it's the
opposite<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> shows<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> old

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
opposite we think it shows that the old

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.710 
opposite we think it shows that the old
masters<00:01:38.100> were<00:01:38.220> even<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.790> amazing<00:01:39.299> because

foreshortening it was so easy I was

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690 
foreshortening it was so easy I was

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it cost me $350 on eBay I suddenly

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.550 
it cost me $350 on eBay I suddenly
understood<00:02:16.060> why<00:02:16.299> hardly<00:02:16.659> any<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.349> art

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
these things Pablo and I realized that

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.679 
these things Pablo and I realized that
we<00:02:21.159> had<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> make<00:02:21.609> this<00:02:21.760> device<00:02:21.939> cheaply

we had to make this device cheaply

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.690 
we had to make this device cheaply
available<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:23.379> everyone<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.280> said<00:02:24.519> about

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
available for everyone so we said about

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.899 
available for everyone so we said about
