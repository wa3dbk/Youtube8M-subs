within<00:01:01.339> dualistic<00:01:02.269> tensions<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.110> think

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
within dualistic tensions and I think

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.490 
within dualistic tensions and I think
Wesley<00:01:04.280> was<00:01:04.610> just<00:01:04.789> a<00:01:04.850> bunch<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.300> tensions<00:01:06.289> of

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
Wesley was just a bunch of tensions of

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
of the modern futuristic even if you

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.789 
of the modern futuristic even if you
think<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.539> Alvin<00:01:40.899> Lucier<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.649> the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
think of Alvin Lucier and the

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.560 
think of Alvin Lucier and the
experimental<00:01:42.729> music<00:01:42.939> that<00:01:43.149> was<00:01:43.240> going<00:01:43.479> on

back then but right next to that is

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.360 
back then but right next to that is
something<00:01:45.460> ancient<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:46.210> primal<00:01:46.600> primordial

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
and that's something I took with me into
this<00:03:08.190> experience<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.780> something<00:03:10.049> that

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and I can honestly say that there would

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520 
and I can honestly say that there would
be<00:03:15.090> no<00:03:15.330> blue<00:03:15.540> man<00:03:15.720> without<00:03:15.870> Wesley<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.440> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
be no blue man without Wesley and I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:30.030 
be no blue man without Wesley and I
really<00:03:16.830> feel<00:03:17.069> comfortable<00:03:17.310> saying

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.089 

but<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:30.849> Wesleyan<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:32.110> studied<00:03:32.530> everything<00:03:32.829> we

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
but at Wesleyan we studied everything we

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.770 
but at Wesleyan we studied everything we
learned<00:03:33.370> through<00:03:33.579> everything<00:03:33.939> and<00:03:34.269> some<00:03:34.659> of

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
learned through everything and some of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.610 
learned through everything and some of
the<00:03:34.840> things<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.260> would<00:03:35.349> have<00:03:35.469> been

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the things that would have been

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.500 
the things that would have been
considered<00:03:36.159> guts<00:03:36.549> at<00:03:36.819> another<00:03:37.030> school<00:03:37.420> are

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
considered guts at another school are

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.899 
considered guts at another school are
the<00:03:37.599> ones<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.859> used<00:03:39.340> here<00:03:39.579> tonight

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
the ones that that I I used here tonight

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.729 
the ones that that I I used here tonight
you<00:03:40.180> know<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> use<00:03:40.540> them<00:03:40.719> every<00:03:40.989> day<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.530> know

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
you know I use them every day you know

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.190 
you know I use them every day you know
and<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.250> learned<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:42.909> took<00:03:43.569> classes<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.140> I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
and I learned I took classes that I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.990 
and I learned I took classes that I
didn't<00:03:44.500> know<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:45.189> help<00:03:45.370> me

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.210 

I<00:03:49.540> think<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.230> there's<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> real<00:03:50.800> richness

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
I think that there's a real richness

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.060 
I think that there's a real richness
that<00:03:51.760> comes<00:03:51.820> from<00:03:52.270> just<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.810> pure<00:03:53.230> education<00:03:53.410> of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that comes from just a pure education of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.220 
that comes from just a pure education of
just<00:03:54.220> sort<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.460> exposing<00:03:55.330> yourself<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.810> this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
just sort of exposing yourself to this

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.070 
just sort of exposing yourself to this
diverse<00:03:56.740> set<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.100> things<00:03:57.810> Wesleyan<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.900> where
