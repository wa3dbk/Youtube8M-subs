00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.030 
floats over time you just sort of do it
so<00:03:06.370> he<00:03:06.489> ends<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:08.459> by<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:09.640> going<00:03:11.040> just

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
so he ends that by just going just

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.130 
so he ends that by just going just
simply<00:03:12.400> II<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.540> pull<00:03:13.750> off<00:03:13.900> from

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
simply II and that that pull off from

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.850 
simply II and that that pull off from
the<00:03:14.230> B<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:15.190> 11<00:03:15.489> meet<00:03:15.670> BA

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.720 

just<00:03:23.860> like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.569 

but<00:03:27.730> we're<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.390> open<00:03:28.659> strings<00:03:28.989> oh<00:03:32.579> okay
