firework out and you know that's what I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.800 
firework out and you know that's what I
said<00:01:40.430> originally<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.729> fireworks<00:01:42.420> video

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
said originally in my fireworks video

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
said originally in my fireworks video
because<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.100> many<00:01:44.250> possibilities

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
because there's so many possibilities

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.280 
because there's so many possibilities
and<00:01:45.710> dimensions<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> different<00:01:47.670> type<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
and dimensions and different type of

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
and dimensions and different type of
ways<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.549> patterns<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> type<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.210> things<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
ways to patterns and type of things that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.710 
ways to patterns and type of things that
you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> fireworks<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> get

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you can put the fireworks in just to get

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
you can put the fireworks in just to get
a<00:01:54.750> different<00:01:55.140> output<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.219> there's<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
a different output because there's so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399 
a different output because there's so
many<00:01:56.880> different<00:01:57.030> output<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> fireworks

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
many different output for the fireworks

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
many different output for the fireworks
it's<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.820> hard<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.930> do

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it's kind of hard for them to not do

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
it's kind of hard for them to not do
manual<00:02:01.680> crafting<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.060> seems<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.600> my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
manual crafting so it seems they got my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.359 
manual crafting so it seems they got my
niall<00:02:03.990> crafting<00:02:04.439> does<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.860> mean<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> we

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
niall crafting does this mean that we

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
niall crafting does this mean that we
would<00:02:05.640> potentially<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.750> could<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:07.079> manual

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
would potentially we could get manual

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
would potentially we could get manual
crafting<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.300> overall<00:02:09.300> well<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.489> honest<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
crafting in overall well to be honest I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
crafting in overall well to be honest I
want<00:02:12.750> overall<00:02:13.319> man

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
want overall man

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
want overall man
your<00:02:13.739> crafting<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.720> would

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
your crafting but I don't think it would

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.220 
your crafting but I don't think it would
be<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.849> i<00:02:18.120> don't<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.450> it'll<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.660> added<00:02:19.110> i

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
be it i don't think it'll be added i

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.930 
be it i don't think it'll be added i
don't<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.650> it'll<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.010> added<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.550> could<00:02:20.790> be

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
don't think it'll be added it could be

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.479 
don't think it'll be added it could be
added<00:02:21.090> hopefully<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:23.099> can't<00:02:23.340> really

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
added hopefully it is we can't really

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.339 
added hopefully it is we can't really
say<00:02:23.610> right<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:27.080> top<00:02:28.080> right

to be the same attributes as they offer
in<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> pc<00:03:02.010> version<00:03:02.040> currently<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.599> if<00:03:03.900> you

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
in the pc version currently so if you

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.300 
in the pc version currently so if you
have<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> pc<00:03:04.470> version<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.130> ahead<00:03:05.220> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
have the pc version you can go ahead and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.339 
have the pc version you can go ahead and
build<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.580> beacon<00:03:05.849> check<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.630> out<00:03:06.660> see<00:03:07.049> how<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
build a beacon check that out see how it

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.890 
build a beacon check that out see how it
works<00:03:07.500> out<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> pc<00:03:08.610> version<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.209> you'll

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
works out on the pc version and you'll

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870 
works out on the pc version and you'll
pretty<00:03:10.049> much<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> same<00:03:10.739> thing<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
pretty much get the same thing on the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.970 
pretty much get the same thing on the
console<00:03:12.420> version<00:03:12.450> when<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.019> comes<00:03:13.290> out<00:03:13.470> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
console version when that comes out so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.210 
console version when that comes out so
on<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.370> bottom<00:03:14.569> on<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.840> bottom<00:03:15.890> two<00:03:16.890> you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
on the bottom on the bottom two you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.810 
on the bottom on the bottom two you
actually<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.810> horse<00:03:19.799> interface<00:03:20.549> like

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
actually have the horse interface like

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.970 
actually have the horse interface like
you<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.060> add<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> horse<00:03:21.780> armor<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.440> saddles

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you can add a horse armor you saddles

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.979 
you can add a horse armor you saddles
things<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
things like that and then that's on the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.080 
things like that and then that's on the
bottom<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:25.470> hand<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.519> bottom<00:03:26.910> left

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
bottom right hand and on the bottom left

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180 
bottom right hand and on the bottom left
hand<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.540> actually<00:03:28.019> just<00:03:28.049> have<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.769> think<00:03:29.040> it's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
hand you actually just have I think it's
