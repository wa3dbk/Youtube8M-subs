last week at against Ireland it was an

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.110 
last week at against Ireland it was an
incredible<00:06:23.040> atmosphere<00:06:23.130> here<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.760> noise<00:06:23.880> was

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
incredible atmosphere here the noise was

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.370

another<00:06:24.330> level<00:06:24.510> on<00:06:24.690> what<00:06:24.840> I've<00:06:24.960> experienced

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
another level on what I've experienced

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.640

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
played in so you know hopefully we'll

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
played in so you know hopefully we'll
have<00:06:30.300> more<00:06:30.480> with<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.630> same<00:06:30.810> I<00:06:30.990> know<00:06:31.020> the

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
anticipations there so hopefully we

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.890 
anticipations there so hopefully we
deliver<00:06:33.120> on<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.300> field<00:06:33.510> give<00:06:33.660> them<00:06:33.750> something
