and I was about probably somewhere

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.340

going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> use<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.280> co2<00:02:23.760> tank<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.750> I'm

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
going to use a co2 tank to do this I'm

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.320 
going to use a co2 tank to do this I'm
going<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.230> gravity<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.090> come<00:02:27.270> up

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
going to use gravity and as I come up

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.020 
going to use gravity and as I come up
here<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:29.990> used<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.620> star<00:02:32.430> sand<00:02:32.790> today<00:02:33.660> -<00:02:34.650> -<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
here I used a star sand today - - and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.460 
here I used a star sand today - - and
there<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> video<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.750> -<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.260> where<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
there is a video on that - of where I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.350 
there is a video on that - of where I
put<00:02:37.890> star<00:02:38.160> sand<00:02:38.460> through<00:02:38.640> all<00:02:38.760> my<00:02:38.790> tubing

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
put star sand through all my tubing

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.500 
put star sand through all my tubing
using<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:40.010> bottled<00:02:41.010> water<00:02:41.040> pump<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
using a bottled water pump and a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.120 
using a bottled water pump and a
five-gallon<00:02:43.110> bottle<00:02:43.380> star<00:02:43.650> saying<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.070> you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
five-gallon bottle star saying if you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760 
five-gallon bottle star saying if you
want<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> check<00:02:44.520> out<00:02:44.700> my<00:02:44.940> video<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.770> you

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
want to check out my video on that you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.740 
want to check out my video on that you
can<00:02:46.950> use<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.520> any<00:02:47.610> beer<00:02:47.850> line<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.540> any

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
can use that for any beer line or any

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.920 
can use that for any beer line or any
type<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.140> line<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.470> sanitize<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.220> very<00:02:50.610> easily

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
type of line to sanitize it very easily

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.330 
type of line to sanitize it very easily
but<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.350> top<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> stairs<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.640> my<00:02:55.340> five

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
but here up top of the stairs is my five

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.740 
but here up top of the stairs is my five
gallons<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.880> beer<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> I'm<00:02:59.760> going<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
gallons of beer and so I'm going to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.580 
gallons of beer and so I'm going to
begin<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.830> filter<00:03:02.340> through<00:03:02.850> gravity<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:04.320> just

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
begin to filter through gravity in just

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.130 
begin to filter through gravity in just
one<00:03:04.800> second<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:07.800> are<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.140> beer

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
one second so here we are I got the beer

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500 
one second so here we are I got the beer
line<00:03:10.380> hooked<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.370> interestingly<00:03:11.910> enough

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
line hooked up and interestingly enough

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.180 
line hooked up and interestingly enough
I<00:03:14.600> had<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.630> push<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.230> pressure<00:03:16.470> relief<00:03:16.950> valve

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
I had to push the pressure relief valve

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.830 
I had to push the pressure relief valve
on<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.520> top<00:03:17.730> there<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> had<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.750> all

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
on the top there because I had it all

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.170 
on the top there because I had it all
hooked<00:03:19.110> up<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.800> dip<00:03:19.980> tube<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
hooked up to the dip tube and in the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.830 
hooked up to the dip tube and in the
cover<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:22.700> but<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.390> had<00:03:24.570> such<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
cover on but I think it just had such a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.780 
cover on but I think it just had such a
tight<00:03:25.170> seal<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.830> didn't<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.310> enough

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.980 

something<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> other<00:03:30.090> end<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.570> anyways

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
something on the other end so anyways

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.350 
something on the other end so anyways
it's<00:03:31.290> flowing<00:03:31.860> now<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.700> beer<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:32.970> really

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
it's flowing now and the beer is really

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.560 
it's flowing now and the beer is really
clear<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.020> it's<00:03:34.110> coming<00:03:34.440> through<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:35.360> can<00:03:36.360> see

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
clear and it's coming through I can see

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.620 
clear and it's coming through I can see
it<00:03:36.690> coming<00:03:37.110> out<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:38.270> don't<00:03:39.270> know<00:03:39.330> if<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> can

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
it coming out I don't know if you can

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.210 
it coming out I don't know if you can
see<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> video<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.770> it's<00:03:40.950> coming

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
see that in the video but it's coming

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.120 
see that in the video but it's coming
through<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:43.050> that's<00:03:43.200> without<00:03:43.380> pushing<00:03:43.830> any

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
through and that's without pushing any

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.449 
through and that's without pushing any
co2<00:03:44.550> or<00:03:44.820> anything<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:46.010> might<00:03:47.010> take<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> little

let here and do it till it empties the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.890 
let here and do it till it empties the
cake<00:03:53.070> or<00:03:53.550> empties<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.030> fermenter<00:03:55.490> so<00:03:56.780> I'll<00:03:57.780> be

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.060 
cake or empties the fermenter so I'll be
back<00:03:58.020> in<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.230> little<00:03:58.320> bit<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.709> let<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:58.980> know

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.690 

okay<00:04:06.090> well<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.540> found<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.340> couldn't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700

have<00:04:10.040> such<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> tight<00:04:11.400> seal<00:04:11.820> on<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.480> had<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
have such a tight seal on this I had to

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.250 
have such a tight seal on this I had to
have<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:15.320> at<00:04:16.320> least<00:04:16.620> something<00:04:17.720> open<00:04:18.720> enough

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
have the at least something open enough

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.310 
have the at least something open enough
hole<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.150> when<00:04:21.299> something<00:04:21.720> got<00:04:21.989> pushed

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
hole so that when something got pushed

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.180 
hole so that when something got pushed
in<00:04:22.530> through<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> beer<00:04:23.360> dip<00:04:24.360> tube<00:04:24.830> air<00:04:25.830> is

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
in through the beer dip tube air is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.110 
in through the beer dip tube air is
coming<00:04:26.430> out<00:04:27.140> because<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.170> was<00:04:28.770> using<00:04:29.070> just<00:04:32.120> that

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
coming out because I was using just that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.000 
coming out because I was using just that
was<00:04:33.240> my<00:04:33.480> wrench

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
was my wrench

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.210 
was my wrench
I<00:04:35.040> had<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.790> gas<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.810> as<00:04:37.790> like<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:39.710> way<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.770> do<00:04:41.100> it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
I had the gas in as like a way to do it

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.430 
I had the gas in as like a way to do it
but<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.550> hole<00:04:41.850> that's<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.960> fitting<00:04:43.320> on

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
but that hole that's on the fitting on

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.670 
but that hole that's on the fitting on
the<00:04:43.710> post<00:04:44.600> wasn't<00:04:45.650> isn't<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:49.410> know<00:04:49.500> that's

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
going in through the dip tube so that's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
going in through the dip tube so that's
my<00:05:13.140> lesson<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:15.650> should<00:05:16.650> take<00:05:16.680> about

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
my lesson on that and should take about
