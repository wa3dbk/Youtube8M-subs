now I wonder if there's any place in

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
much as this era has completed me

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.210

but<00:03:47.300> all<00:03:47.540> history<00:03:48.080> lives<00:03:48.319> in<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.590> cloud<00:03:48.890> now

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
but all history lives in the cloud now

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.729 
but all history lives in the cloud now
maybe<00:03:50.150> no<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.569> even<00:03:50.690> knows<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.349> true<00:03:51.590> history

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
maybe no one even knows the true history

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.339 
maybe no one even knows the true history
