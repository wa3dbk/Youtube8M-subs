00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
sure Clayton this is the legged squad

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.420 
sure Clayton this is the legged squad
support<00:00:38.780> system<00:00:39.110> surely<00:00:39.530> known<00:00:39.650> as<00:00:39.800> ls3<00:00:40.250> and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
support system surely known as ls3 and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.740 
support system surely known as ls3 and
I'm<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.610> chief<00:00:40.790> engineer<00:00:40.970> on<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.480> ls3

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
I'm the chief engineer on the ls3

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.270 
I'm the chief engineer on the ls3
project<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.770> what<00:00:42.860> you're<00:00:42.980> basically

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
project and what you're basically

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.180 
project and what you're basically
looking<00:00:43.489> at<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.000> robotic<00:00:44.600> pack<00:00:44.809> mule<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:45.559> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
looking at is a robotic pack mule so the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.340 
looking at is a robotic pack mule so the
real<00:00:46.370> goal<00:00:46.400> for<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:46.970> machine<00:00:47.839> is<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.230> go

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
real goal for this machine is to go

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.530 
real goal for this machine is to go
where<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.710> dismantle<00:00:49.220> warfighter<00:00:49.550> does<00:00:49.820> and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
where the dismantle warfighter does and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.390 
where the dismantle warfighter does and
to<00:00:50.600> help<00:00:50.780> carry<00:00:51.050> their<00:00:51.199> load<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:51.829> how<00:00:52.220> does<00:00:52.280> it

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
to help carry their load so how does it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.189 
to help carry their load so how does it
stand<00:00:52.670> up<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.059> like<00:00:53.269> mountains<00:00:53.750> rivers

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
stand up to like mountains rivers

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.049 
stand up to like mountains rivers
different<00:00:54.949> trade<00:00:55.220> yeah<00:00:55.610> that's<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.940> great

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
different trade yeah that's a great

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.790 
different trade yeah that's a great
question<00:00:56.150> and<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.750> really<00:00:57.079> why<00:00:57.620> we

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
question and this is really why we

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.110 
question and this is really why we
develop<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.220> machine<00:00:58.519> is<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.790> that<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.030> would

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
develop this machine is so that it would

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.039 
develop this machine is so that it would
be<00:00:59.210> all-terrain

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
be all-terrain

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.109 
be all-terrain
so<00:01:00.379> we've<00:01:00.559> tested<00:01:00.799> stream<00:01:01.339> crossings<00:01:01.850> we've

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
so we've tested stream crossings we've

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.299 
so we've tested stream crossings we've
gone<00:01:02.299> to<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.659> mountains<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.680> Twentynine

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
gone to the mountains in Twentynine

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.580 
gone to the mountains in Twentynine
Palms<00:01:04.580> California<00:01:04.960> we've<00:01:05.960> tested<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.350> lot<00:01:06.380> of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
Palms California we've tested a lot of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.140 
Palms California we've tested a lot of
East<00:01:06.770> Coast<00:01:06.979> woods<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.670> mountains<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.119> we

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
East Coast woods and mountains so we

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.340 
East Coast woods and mountains so we
really<00:01:08.479> are<00:01:08.600> trying<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.020> go<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:09.290> many

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
really are trying to go to as many

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.710 
really are trying to go to as many
different<00:01:09.530> terrains<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.340> can<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.479> push

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
different terrains as we can and push

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.270 
different terrains as we can and push
the<00:01:11.869> mobility<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.500> autonomy<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.010> machine

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
the mobility in the autonomy the machine

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.130 
the mobility in the autonomy the machine
so<00:01:13.460> if<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.610> keep<00:01:13.790> up<00:01:13.939> with<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.180> warfighter<00:01:14.570> so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
so if you keep up with the warfighter so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.780 
so if you keep up with the warfighter so
I'm<00:01:15.439> really<00:01:15.680> excited<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.220> actually<00:01:16.310> see<00:01:16.700> this

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
thing in action so can you give up and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.800 
thing in action so can you give up and
give<00:01:19.549> me<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> demo<00:01:19.820> yeah<00:01:20.180> let's<00:01:20.420> take<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.659> for<00:01:20.750> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
give me a demo yeah let's take it for a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:35.860 
give me a demo yeah let's take it for a
walk<00:01:20.960> all<00:01:21.140> right<00:01:21.229> great<00:01:21.380> let's<00:01:21.590> do<00:01:21.710> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.510 

so<00:01:36.870> what<00:01:37.410> can<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.620> tell<00:01:37.740> me<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so what can you tell me about the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.080 
so what can you tell me about the
different<00:01:38.820> functions<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> modes<00:01:40.850> well<00:01:41.850> it's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
different functions and modes well it's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
different functions and modes well it's
a<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.210> time<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.510> ask<00:01:42.630> cuz<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.050> in<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
a good time to ask cuz we're in one of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.320 
a good time to ask cuz we're in one of
them<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.729> leader

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
them right now so this is a leader

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.969 
them right now so this is a leader
follow<00:01:45.630> mode<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.260> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
follow mode and this is kind of the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
follow mode and this is kind of the
bread<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.280> butter<00:01:47.400> for<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:47.880> ls3<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.540> really

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
bread and butter for how ls3 is really

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
bread and butter for how ls3 is really
going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> operate<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.430> idea<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.910> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to operate the idea is that you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.490 
going to operate the idea is that you
know<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.259> really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
know you can see I'm not really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.020 
know you can see I'm not really
distracted<00:01:52.979> by<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> robot<00:01:53.520> right<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.820> we're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
distracted by the robot right now we're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
distracted by the robot right now we're
able<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> conversation<00:01:55.080> or<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.440> could

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
able to have a conversation or I could

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.859 
able to have a conversation or I could
be<00:01:55.860> doing<00:01:56.070> something<00:01:56.190> else<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.360> effectively

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
be doing something else but effectively

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
be doing something else but effectively

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the robots following the stripes on my

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840 
the robots following the stripes on my
backpack<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.530> using<00:02:01.920> me<00:02:02.039> as<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.220> guide<00:02:02.399> for

backpack and using me as a guide for
working<00:02:03.360> through<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> terrain<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.410> get

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
working through the terrain if you get

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.260 
working through the terrain if you get
in<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.800> tight<00:02:05.009> pinch<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.580> also<00:02:05.729> directly

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
in a tight pinch you can also directly

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
in a tight pinch you can also directly
control<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> joystick<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
control it with the joystick and and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100 
control it with the joystick and and
then<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:09.000> fully<00:02:09.360> autonomous<00:02:09.690> mode

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
then we have a fully autonomous mode

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.720 
then we have a fully autonomous mode
which<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> Waypoint<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.580> tell

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
which is go to Waypoint so you can tell

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
which is go to Waypoint so you can tell
the<00:02:11.820> robot<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.870> go<00:02:13.080> 100<00:02:13.410> meters<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the robot you know go 100 meters that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
the robot you know go 100 meters that
way<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> robot<00:02:14.640> without<00:02:14.730> any<00:02:15.090> driver<00:02:15.420> or

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
way and the robot without any driver or

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.900 
way and the robot without any driver or
leader<00:02:15.959> will<00:02:16.709> autonomously<00:02:17.310> work<00:02:17.580> its<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
leader will autonomously work its way to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.660 
leader will autonomously work its way to
that<00:02:18.150> goal<00:02:18.180> point<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:21.860> well<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.160> main<00:02:23.340> idea

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that goal point so well the main idea

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.190 
that goal point so well the main idea
for<00:02:23.880> Marines<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.300> now<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.050> an

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
for Marines right now is as an

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680 
for Marines right now is as an
offloading<00:02:25.680> capability<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.360> know

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
offloading capability so you know

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.120 
offloading capability so you know
dismounted<00:02:28.230> Marines<00:02:28.470> typically<00:02:28.920> carry

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
dismounted Marines typically carry

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.610 
dismounted Marines typically carry
around<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.489> hundred<00:02:29.610> pounds<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.209> gear<00:02:31.200> between

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
around a hundred pounds of gear between

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.759 
around a hundred pounds of gear between
body<00:02:31.860> armor<00:02:32.250> backpack<00:02:32.760> food<00:02:33.180> water<00:02:33.540> ammo<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
body armor backpack food water ammo and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.830 
body armor backpack food water ammo and
the<00:02:34.890> idea<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:35.940> us<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.390> off<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the idea is for us to get that off the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.810 
the idea is for us to get that off the
warfighter<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.980> improve<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
warfighter and really improve the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.759 
warfighter and really improve the
warfighters<00:02:39.209> mobility<00:02:39.690> reduce<00:02:40.140> injury<00:02:40.500> rates

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
warfighters mobility reduce injury rates

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.620 
warfighters mobility reduce injury rates
and<00:02:41.489> generally<00:02:41.970> improve<00:02:42.299> their<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.540> their

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and generally improve their at their

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.500 
and generally improve their at their
capabilities<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.340> know<00:02:44.459> ideally<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.420> can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
capabilities so you know ideally you can

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
capabilities so you know ideally you can
take<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> lot<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.140> equipment<00:02:46.500> that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
take a lot of the equipment that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.289 
take a lot of the equipment that
warfighters<00:02:47.160> carry<00:02:47.400> through<00:02:47.700> through<00:02:48.150> long

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
warfighters carry through through long

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.720 
warfighters carry through through long
foot<00:02:48.540> patrols<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.680> put<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> robot<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
foot patrols and put it on the robot and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:02.690 
foot patrols and put it on the robot and
have<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> care<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> gear<00:02:51.630> for<00:02:51.780> them

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.150 

the<00:03:03.240> ls3<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.930> still<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.200> development<00:03:04.319> stages

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the ls3 it's still in development stages

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.010 
the ls3 it's still in development stages
to<00:03:05.340> make<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.670> more<00:03:05.849> suitable<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.330> Marines

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
to make it more suitable for Marines

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.900 
to make it more suitable for Marines
