00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
even believe it just every part of the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.590 
even believe it just every part of the
squad<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.399> dripping<00:01:56.670> full<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> sweat<00:01:57.570> and

squad is just dripping full of sweat and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 
squad is just dripping full of sweat and
pace<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.500> amazing<00:01:59.189> ability<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pace and just amazing ability and all of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.850 
pace and just amazing ability and all of
them<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> worst<00:02:01.350> player<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
them probably the worst player in the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.700 
them probably the worst player in the
team<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.250> park<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.790> left<00:02:03.240> wing<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.259> he's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
team is park at left wing back now he's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.440 
team is park at left wing back now he's
only<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.189> 24<00:02:05.579> pace<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.180> mean<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
only got a 24 pace which I mean it's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.389 
only got a 24 pace which I mean it's
tragic<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.899> say<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
tragic to say that that is one of the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.729 
tragic to say that that is one of the
slower<00:02:08.640> players<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> team<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.720> he<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
slower players in the team but he is

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.930 
slower players in the team but he is
quite<00:02:11.069> good<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.400> terms<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.819> forward

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
quite good in terms of going forward

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400 
quite good in terms of going forward
which<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.690> why<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> wanted

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
which is why I wanted

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
which is why I wanted
the<00:02:13.470> left<00:02:13.680> wingback<00:02:13.890> decent<00:02:14.880> parson<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the left wingback decent parson and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.350 
the left wingback decent parson and
decent<00:02:16.230> dribbling<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> left<00:02:18.240> back

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
decent dribbling for a for a left back

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.760 
decent dribbling for a for a left back
so<00:02:18.540> he<00:02:18.630> did<00:02:18.810> actually<00:02:18.900> turn<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> decent

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
so he did actually turn to be a decent

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.490 
so he did actually turn to be a decent
fullback<00:02:20.340> wingback<00:02:21.330> even<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:21.870> next<00:02:22.290> up

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
fullback wingback even so next up

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
fullback wingback even so next up
instant<00:02:22.890> amid<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.490> park<00:02:24.060> ji-sung<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
instant amid we have a park ji-sung and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.260 
instant amid we have a park ji-sung and
we<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.920> coup<00:02:26.340> both<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.210> these

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
players are very useful goal to have I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.790

did<00:02:30.120> want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.840> go<00:02:30.990> for<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.320> gold<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
did want to go for the gold in the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.680 
did want to go for the gold in the
center<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.490> park<00:02:32.730> now<00:02:32.970> obviously<00:02:33.510> there's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
so much pace on this side but I did feel

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
so much pace on this side but I did feel
like<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.580> needed<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.720> raw<00:02:36.900> passing<00:02:37.470> it's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
