Bill Bassett and I'm here to tell you

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.590 
Bill Bassett and I'm here to tell you
about<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.859> play<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.339> pedal<00:00:05.490> steel<00:00:05.700> guitar

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
about how to play the pedal steel guitar

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.230 
about how to play the pedal steel guitar
the<00:00:07.290> knee<00:00:07.470> levers<00:00:07.919> are<00:00:08.309> very<00:00:08.519> important<00:00:08.910> also

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the knee levers are very important also

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.700 
the knee levers are very important also
they<00:00:09.420> do<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.690> same<00:00:09.900> type<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.260> thing<00:00:10.590> but

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
they do the same type of thing but

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.470 
they do the same type of thing but
they're<00:00:10.860> activated<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.519> knees<00:00:11.820> this

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
they're activated with the knees this

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.990 
they're activated with the knees this
one<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:13.740> knee<00:00:14.009> pushing<00:00:14.490> toward<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
one on my right knee pushing toward the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.740 
one on my right knee pushing toward the
inside<00:00:15.590> changes<00:00:16.590> my<00:00:16.740> east<00:00:17.130> rings<00:00:17.520> down<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> half

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
inside changes my east rings down a half

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.240 
inside changes my east rings down a half
step<00:00:19.820> if<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.910> go<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> other<00:00:21.510> side<00:00:22.250> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
step if I go to the other side it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.910 
step if I go to the other side it
changes<00:00:23.279> both<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.939> E<00:00:23.970> strings<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.439> half<00:00:25.619> step

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
changes both my E strings up a half step

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.220 
changes both my E strings up a half step
so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.269> play

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.140 

and<00:00:32.830> yet<00:00:33.160> chord<00:00:33.670> changes<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:34.210> way<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:37.090> the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
and yet chord changes that way now the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.990 
and yet chord changes that way now the
knee<00:00:37.630> levers<00:00:37.900> on<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.050> other<00:00:38.260> side<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.850> an

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
knee levers on the other side do an

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.220 
knee levers on the other side do an
important<00:00:40.360> function<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.050> same

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
important function to the same

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.440 
important function to the same
mechanisms<00:00:41.890> apply<00:00:42.610> but<00:00:43.120> on<00:00:43.300> different

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
mechanisms apply but on different

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:55.130 
mechanisms apply but on different
strings<00:00:44.140> I've<00:00:44.740> got<00:00:45.010> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:06.860 

I<00:00:55.200> can<00:00:55.829> change

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.110 

make<00:01:07.870> all<00:01:08.020> sorts<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.380> different<00:01:08.470> changes<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:10.000> I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
make all sorts of different changes if I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.910 
make all sorts of different changes if I
want<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.360> hit<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.480> seventh<00:01:10.870> chord

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.270 

the<00:01:15.880> on<00:01:16.180> my<00:01:16.360> left<00:01:16.600> need<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.620> lever<00:01:18.190> that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the on my left need the lever that

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.090 
the on my left need the lever that
pushes<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.850> outside<00:01:22.409> changes<00:01:23.409> that<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:23.860> so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
pushes to the outside changes that up so

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.570 
pushes to the outside changes that up so
I<00:01:24.130> have<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> 7th<00:01:24.760> chord

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
I have a 7th chord

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.180 
I have a 7th chord
and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.230> goes<00:01:28.380> vertically<00:01:28.800> too

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
and I got one that goes vertically too

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.300 
and I got one that goes vertically too
so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.120> go<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.740> we've<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:31.890> an<00:01:31.980> a<00:01:32.100> major

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so I can go from we've got an a major

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.469 
so I can go from we've got an a major
chord<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.940> my<00:01:33.060> petals<00:01:33.420> down

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
chord with my petals down

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.780 
chord with my petals down
raise<00:01:36.049> up<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.409> one<00:01:36.619> pedal<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.369> lowers<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
raise up on one pedal and it lowers a

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.999 
raise up on one pedal and it lowers a
string<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:39.710> minor<00:01:40.189> interval<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.790> get<00:01:41.060> a

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
string to a minor interval so I get a

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.920 
string to a minor interval so I get a
major<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.520> major<00:01:44.360> card<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.990> minor<00:01:45.710> chord<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
major a major card a minor chord and it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.550 
major a major card a minor chord and it
back<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.290> one<00:01:48.439> word<00:01:49.479> it's<00:01:50.479> an<00:01:50.840> amazing<00:01:51.380> set

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
back to the one word it's an amazing set

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.399 
back to the one word it's an amazing set
of<00:01:51.680> possibilities<00:01:52.390> within<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.840> case<00:01:54.020> seven

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
of possibilities within this case seven

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.430 
of possibilities within this case seven
pedals<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.920> five<00:01:55.399> knee<00:01:55.640> levers<00:01:56.229> any<00:01:57.229> other

pedals and five knee levers any other
guitar<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.920> might<00:01:58.100> find<00:01:58.310> might<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.880> similar

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
guitar you might find might have similar

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
guitar you might find might have similar
setups<00:01:59.689> or<00:01:59.899> completely<00:02:00.470> different<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:00.979> they

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
setups or completely different but they

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.060 
setups or completely different but they
all<00:02:01.159> work<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> same<00:02:02.049> principle<00:02:03.049> that<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
all work on the same principle that the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.950 
all work on the same principle that the
pedals<00:02:04.430> change<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.479> pitch<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.899> strings

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
pedals change the pitch of the strings

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.490 
pedals change the pitch of the strings
up<00:02:06.409> or<00:02:06.680> down<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.989> from<00:02:08.989> that<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.200> can

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
up or down and from that you can

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.330 
up or down and from that you can
construct<00:02:10.959> endless<00:02:11.959> array<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.800> chord<00:02:13.220> changes

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
construct endless array of chord changes

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.269 
construct endless array of chord changes
and<00:02:13.760> voicings
