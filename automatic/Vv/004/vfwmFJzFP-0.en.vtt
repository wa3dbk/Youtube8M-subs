00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.490 
to the gun in through there like
literally<00:02:17.030> force<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.569> here<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.319> really

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
literally force it in here you really

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.449 
literally force it in here you really
push<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:19.069> there<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:20.270> can't<00:02:20.510> be<00:02:20.600> done<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.080> just

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
push it in there it can't be done I just

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.270 
push it in there it can't be done I just
what<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.760> them<00:02:23.000> then<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.890> turn<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.069> so

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
what you have them then you turn it so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.850 
what you have them then you turn it so
that<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.640> get<00:02:25.819> his<00:02:26.290> fourth<00:02:27.290> finger<00:02:27.590> coming

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that you get his fourth finger coming

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.430 
that you get his fourth finger coming
through<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:29.319> guess<00:02:30.319> that's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
through I guess that's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.000 
through I guess that's
his<00:02:31.860> index<00:02:32.250> finger<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.670> coming<00:02:33.270> through<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
his index finger just coming through the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
his index finger just coming through the
trigger<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.120> one<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.750> stopped<00:02:36.990> coming

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
trigger and this one just stopped coming

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.260 
trigger and this one just stopped coming
around<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.340> kind<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.610> had<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.210> think

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
around it's a kind of had to and I think

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.060 
around it's a kind of had to and I think
that<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.530> later<00:02:40.740> figure

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
that is it can I have that later figure

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.540 
that is it can I have that later figure
down<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.430> order<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.820> do<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.090> though<00:02:43.370> okay<00:02:44.370> let

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
down in order to do this though okay let

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.020 
down in order to do this though okay let
me<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.820> turn<00:02:45.000> them<00:02:45.120> around<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
me just turn them around and do that
