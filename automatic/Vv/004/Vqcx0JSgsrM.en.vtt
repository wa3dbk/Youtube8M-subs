00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
work for now but there's a I got to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
work for now but there's a I got to
thinking<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.390> fridges<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.560> need

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
thinking about fridges and how they need

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.609 
thinking about fridges and how they need
air<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> put<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.030> screened<00:01:30.500> opening<00:01:31.500> in

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
air so I put in a screened opening in

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.359 
air so I put in a screened opening in
there<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> air<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.130> flow<00:01:35.280> through

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
there so that the air will flow through

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.609 
there so that the air will flow through
it<00:01:35.759> give<00:01:36.180> breathability<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it give breathability to the back of the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
it give breathability to the back of the
fridge<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.100> doesn't<00:01:38.340> overheat<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:40.200> what

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fridge so it doesn't overheat but what

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.880 
fridge so it doesn't overheat but what
else<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.100> need<00:01:41.460> doors<00:01:42.350> for<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.439> cabinets

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
else do I need doors for these cabinets

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
else do I need doors for these cabinets
and<00:01:44.070> finish<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> inside<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and finish the inside of them and I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
and finish the inside of them and I
still<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> buckle<00:01:46.680> edges<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.210> doors

still have to buckle edges and the doors
themselves<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.890> gives<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.250> they

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.940 
using plywood and cutting out these cute
little<00:01:55.979> trims<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:58.110> balance<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.619> because

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
little trims to balance this out because

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
actually got given all the hardware for

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.109 
actually got given all the hardware for
the<00:02:03.390> most<00:02:03.540> part<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.909> lot

the most part that's in here from a lot

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.080 
the most part that's in here from a lot
of<00:02:06.270> its<00:02:06.390> Oh<00:02:06.780> 60<00:02:07.439> 70<00:02:07.829> year<00:02:08.009> old<00:02:08.129> hardware<00:02:08.520> like

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
of its Oh 60 70 year old hardware like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.790 
of its Oh 60 70 year old hardware like
all<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> nails<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> stuff<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> use<00:02:10.530> to

were able to get use all of his stuff

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.940 
were able to get use all of his stuff
and<00:02:22.420> keep<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.140> know<00:02:23.230> keep<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.620> going

and keep the you know keep it going
which<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.760> what<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.300> most<00:02:25.450> about<00:02:25.600> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
which was what I like the most about it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.840 
which was what I like the most about it
which<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.170> where<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.770> hardware<00:02:27.010> from<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
which is where the hardware from the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.630 
which is where the hardware from the
door<00:02:28.060> with<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.540> exception<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.250> top<00:02:30.460> hinge

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
door with the exception of the top hinge

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.270 
door with the exception of the top hinge
in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.820> bottom<00:02:31.090> hitch<00:02:31.300> came<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.860> them<00:02:33.070> from

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
in the bottom hitch came I got them from

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.030 
in the bottom hitch came I got them from
him<00:02:33.460> but<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.850> had<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.270> buy<00:02:34.390> those<00:02:35.010> when<00:02:36.010> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
him but I had to buy those when I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.350 
him but I had to buy those when I
realized<00:02:36.430> later<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> should<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.240> put

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
realized later that I should have put

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.640 
realized later that I should have put
those<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.660> either<00:02:37.780> end<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> couldn't

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
those on either end but I couldn't

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.230 
those on either end but I couldn't
because<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> trim<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.550> door<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
because of the trim on the door for the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.680 
because of the trim on the door for the
screen<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.370> way<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.580> was<00:02:42.670> laid<00:02:42.850> out<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.420> I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
screen so the way it was laid out so I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.240 
screen so the way it was laid out so I
kind<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.290> stuck<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.800> putting<00:02:44.980> them<00:02:45.130> right

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
kind of stuck with putting them right

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.920 
kind of stuck with putting them right
there<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.850> works<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.270> shuts<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> door<00:02:46.660> like

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
there it works it shuts the door like

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.010 
there it works it shuts the door like
it's<00:02:47.050> supposed<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:47.770> have<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> pop<00:02:48.370> latch

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
it's supposed to and I have a pop latch

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380 
it's supposed to and I have a pop latch
for<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.410> step<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.980> catch<00:02:51.490> step<00:02:51.820> right

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
for the it's a step I catch step right

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.180 
for the it's a step I catch step right
now<00:02:52.450> that's<00:02:52.780> coated<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.650> haven't<00:02:53.920> got<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.100> on

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
now that's coated so I haven't got it on

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.680 
now that's coated so I haven't got it on
there<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.580> just<00:02:54.610> slams<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.270> door<00:02:55.300> shut

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
there but it just slams the door shut

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.450 
there but it just slams the door shut
and<00:02:56.050> calls<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:56.890> you're<00:02:57.010> traveling<00:02:57.160> it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
and calls it so when you're traveling it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.770 
and calls it so when you're traveling it
doesn't<00:02:57.700> pop<00:02:57.820> back<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.240> forth<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.630> kind

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
doesn't pop back and forth and that kind

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.050 
doesn't pop back and forth and that kind
of<00:02:58.810> stuff<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.750> inside<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:05.970> had<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
of stuff it's inside here I had the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.430 
of stuff it's inside here I had the
latches<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.600> there<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:07.810> haven't<00:03:08.230> finished

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
latches in there I just haven't finished

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.940 
latches in there I just haven't finished
them

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
them

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400 
them
I<00:03:08.980> made<00:03:09.670> everything<00:03:10.030> with<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.140> bottom

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
I made everything with the on the bottom

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.320 
I made everything with the on the bottom
with<00:03:11.860> all<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.430> moldings<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.940> everything<00:03:13.180> pop

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
with all the moldings and everything pop

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.630 
with all the moldings and everything pop
out<00:03:13.510> with<00:03:13.630> screws<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.620> panel<00:03:15.010> pops<00:03:15.340> out

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
out with screws and this panel pops out

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.430 
out with screws and this panel pops out
on<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:16.060> side<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.720> two<00:03:16.990> screws<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.320> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
on this side with two screws on the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.830 
on this side with two screws on the
bottom<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.800> two<00:03:17.860> screws<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.610> top<00:03:18.840> because

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
bottom and two screws on the top because

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.150 
bottom and two screws on the top because
there's<00:03:20.020> water<00:03:20.260> lines<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.830> run<00:03:20.980> through

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
there's water lines that run through

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.620 
there's water lines that run through
there<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.610> there's<00:03:21.820> also<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.060> trap<00:03:22.300> underneath

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
there and there's also a trap underneath

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.780 
there and there's also a trap underneath
so<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.959> wanted<00:03:23.230> people<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.590> have<00:03:23.739> access<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.459> all

and stuff like that so I made everything
so<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.340> come<00:03:33.640> out<00:03:33.820> but<00:03:34.600> that's<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.989> inside

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
so that come out but that's the inside

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.370 
so that come out but that's the inside
of<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.530> there's<00:03:36.010> also<00:03:37.200> when<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.260> was

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
of it there's also when I was

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.840 
of it there's also when I was
constructing<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.400> was<00:03:39.489> trying<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.730> figure

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
constructing this I was trying to figure

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.010 
constructing this I was trying to figure
out<00:03:39.940> what<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> was<00:03:40.239> gonna<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> virgin<00:03:40.840> when<00:03:40.930> I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
out what I was gonna do a virgin when I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.300 
out what I was gonna do a virgin when I
was<00:03:41.110> gonna<00:03:41.200> put<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> fridge<00:03:41.650> down<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.100> this

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
was gonna put the fridge down on this

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.170 
was gonna put the fridge down on this
end<00:03:43.170> instead<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.260> where<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:45.970> put

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
end instead of where it is now so I put

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.070 
end instead of where it is now so I put
the<00:03:46.270> plug<00:03:46.480> down<00:03:46.690> here<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.250> because<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> plug

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the plug down here and because the plug

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.860 
the plug down here and because the plug
is<00:03:50.080> underneath<00:03:50.709> all<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:52.209> wanted<00:03:52.810> to

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
is underneath all of this I wanted to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.330 
is underneath all of this I wanted to
make<00:03:53.020> sure<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.470> always<00:03:53.590> had<00:03:53.860> access<00:03:54.040> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
make sure that we always had access to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.250 
make sure that we always had access to
it<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.330> created<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.730> trapdoor<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:58.330> get<00:03:58.870> access

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
it so I created a trapdoor to get access

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.800 
it so I created a trapdoor to get access
to<00:03:59.290> maybe<00:04:00.070> see<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.459> plug<00:04:00.640> down<00:04:00.820> in<00:04:01.000> there<00:04:01.150> so

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
to maybe see the plug down in there so

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.080 
to maybe see the plug down in there so
you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.080> plug<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.560> unplug<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.920> fridge<00:04:03.310> at

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
you can plug and unplug the fridge at

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.380 
you can plug and unplug the fridge at
nauseam<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.830> speak<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.400> also<00:04:07.090> give<00:04:07.270> you

two by twos as light as they are do
corkscrew<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:37.550> that's<00:05:37.760> what<00:05:38.390> I've<00:05:38.510> been

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
corkscrew and so that's what I've been

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.180 
corkscrew and so that's what I've been
kind<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:38.990> dealing<00:05:39.320> with<00:05:39.350> a<00:05:39.500> little<00:05:39.740> at<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.890> time

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
kind of dealing with a little at a time

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.159 
kind of dealing with a little at a time
I<00:05:40.430> will<00:05:40.610> use<00:05:41.030> dimensional<00:05:41.570> lumber<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.960> next

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
I will use dimensional lumber the next

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.600 
I will use dimensional lumber the next
time<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.320> build<00:05:42.590> one<00:05:42.740> of<00:05:42.860> these<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.040> will<00:05:43.280> buy<00:05:43.550> the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
time I build one of these I will buy the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.030 
time I build one of these I will buy the
1<00:05:43.880> by<00:05:44.000> 3s<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.390> spend<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.750> extra<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:45.410> mean<00:05:45.860> it's

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
1 by 3s and spend the extra I mean it's

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.890 
1 by 3s and spend the extra I mean it's
a<00:05:46.100> huge<00:05:46.400> difference<00:05:46.669> it's<00:05:47.030> like<00:05:47.180> 8<00:05:47.360> times<00:05:47.600> the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
a huge difference it's like 8 times the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.070 
a huge difference it's like 8 times the
price<00:05:48.140> of<00:05:48.320> a<00:05:48.380> 2<00:05:48.530> by<00:05:48.560> 2<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:49.040> get<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.490> dimensional

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
price of a 2 by 2 to get the dimensional

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.490 
price of a 2 by 2 to get the dimensional
but<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.950> makes<00:05:52.250> life<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:53.660> much<00:05:53.690> easier<00:05:53.990> when

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
but it makes life so much easier when

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.870 
but it makes life so much easier when
you<00:05:54.560> don't<00:05:54.860> have<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.160> deal<00:05:55.370> with<00:05:55.400> uneven

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.440 
you don't have to deal with uneven
