00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
muscles and connective tissues so you

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.590 
muscles and connective tissues so you

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
you can do it a little bit more in

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.310 
you can do it a little bit more in
between<00:01:28.580> that's<00:01:29.060> okay<00:01:29.390> too<00:01:29.450> daily<00:01:30.049> stretching

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
between that's okay too daily stretching

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.219 
between that's okay too daily stretching
is<00:01:30.619> great<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.580> at<00:01:31.820> minimum<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.780> should<00:01:33.110> be

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
each time so how long will this routine

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.520 
each time so how long will this routine
take<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.390> you're<00:01:38.479> about<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.750> show<00:01:39.049> us<00:01:39.200> today

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
take that you're about to show us today

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.710 
take that you're about to show us today
after<00:01:39.979> each<00:01:40.159> workout<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.150> routine<00:01:41.540> will

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
after each workout this routine will

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.230 
after each workout this routine will
really<00:01:42.020> only<00:01:42.200> take<00:01:42.590> five<00:01:43.220> minutes<00:01:43.250> maybe<00:01:43.880> less

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
really only take five minutes maybe less

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.080 
really only take five minutes maybe less
but<00:01:44.540> those<00:01:45.320> five<00:01:45.740> minutes<00:01:46.220> can<00:01:46.460> make<00:01:46.640> such<00:01:46.909> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
but those five minutes can make such a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.750 
but those five minutes can make such a
tremendous<00:01:48.020> difference<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.799> your<00:01:49.310> training

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
tremendous difference in your training

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.510 
tremendous difference in your training
abilities<00:01:50.510> and<00:01:50.780> from<00:01:51.170> preventing<00:01:51.890> injuries

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
abilities and from preventing injuries

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.130 
abilities and from preventing injuries
so<00:01:53.119> let's<00:01:53.330> get<00:01:53.509> started

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
so let's get started

over<00:03:34.459> that's<00:03:34.760> where<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.150> need<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.390> stop

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
over that's where you need to stop

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.110 
over that's where you need to stop
that's<00:03:36.320> where<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:36.709> body<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.310> saying<00:03:37.610> that's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
that's where your body is saying that's

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.970 
that's where your body is saying that's
enough<00:03:38.600> that's<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.170> further<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.500> want<00:03:39.890> to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
enough that's all the further I want to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.670 
enough that's all the further I want to
go<00:03:40.130> find<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.910> place<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.870> then<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.500> take<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
go find that place and then just take a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.190 
go find that place and then just take a
few<00:03:42.950> breaths<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.459> allow<00:03:44.239> your<00:03:44.570> body<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
few breaths there allow your body to

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.920 
few breaths there allow your body to
release<00:03:45.650> those<00:03:46.010> tight<00:03:46.370> areas<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.360> breathing

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
release those tight areas so breathing

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.449 
release those tight areas so breathing
is<00:03:48.080> very<00:03:48.320> very<00:03:48.560> critical<00:03:48.830> with<00:03:49.250> our

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
is very very critical with our

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.640 
is very very critical with our
stretching<00:03:49.760> also<00:03:50.420> so<00:03:51.019> we're<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.410> going<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
stretching also so we're just going to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.380 
stretching also so we're just going to
demonstrate<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.519> one<00:03:52.790> side<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.299> you
