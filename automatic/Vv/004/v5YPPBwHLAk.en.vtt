about<00:00:03.750> ten<00:00:04.410> years<00:00:04.440> ago<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.920> got<00:00:05.160> into<00:00:05.400> splitting

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
about ten years ago I got into splitting

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.839 
about ten years ago I got into splitting
things<00:00:06.150> up<00:00:07.910> and<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.059> lot<00:00:09.240> more<00:00:09.269> paddocks<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
things up and a lot more paddocks and

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.339 
things up and a lot more paddocks and
setups<00:00:11.849> likely<00:00:12.210> rotate<00:00:12.599> them<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.809> control<00:00:13.200> it

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
setups likely rotate them and control it

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.829 
setups likely rotate them and control it
better<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.370> notice<00:00:14.639> try<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> add<00:00:15.179> just

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
better and a notice try to add just

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.960 
better and a notice try to add just
about<00:00:16.049> triples<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.699> production<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.820> all

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
about triples of the production on all

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.090 
about triples of the production on all
that<00:00:18.180> ground<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.660> start<00:00:21.660> getting<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
that ground and start getting the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
that ground and start getting the
good-good<00:00:23.210> species<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.660> orchard

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
good-good species like a lot of orchard

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.339 
good-good species like a lot of orchard
grass<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.710> clovers<00:00:29.900> your<00:00:30.900> mob<00:00:31.109> grazing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
grass and clovers your mob grazing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.560 
grass and clovers your mob grazing
almost<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.160> drought<00:00:32.579> insurance<00:00:33.149> because

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
almost is like drought insurance because

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.540 
almost is like drought insurance because
you're<00:00:33.899> you're<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.829> killing<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> road<00:00:35.460> on

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you're you're not killing the road on

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.830 
you're you're not killing the road on
that<00:00:35.579> plant<00:00:35.969> you've<00:00:36.239> still<00:00:36.450> got<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> deep

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that plant you've still got a deep

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
that plant you've still got a deep
throat<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.380> plant<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.879> you're<00:00:39.660> moving

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
throat on that plant and you're moving

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
throat on that plant and you're moving
them<00:00:40.079> through<00:00:40.110> maybe<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.399> between<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
them through maybe just for between one

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.049 
them through maybe just for between one
to<00:00:42.750> five<00:00:42.899> days<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.739> particular<00:00:44.670> piece<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to five days on that particular piece of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.200 
to five days on that particular piece of
ground<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.340> them<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
ground and then you get them out of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
ground and then you get them out of
there<00:00:48.360> give<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.469> 60<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> 90<00:00:50.250> day<00:00:50.370> rest<00:00:50.670> period

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there give it a 60 to 90 day rest period

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
there give it a 60 to 90 day rest period
your<00:00:51.629> plants<00:00:52.020> thrive<00:00:52.320> everything<00:00:52.829> goes<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
your plants thrive everything goes to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.139 
your plants thrive everything goes to
seed<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:55.370> you're<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.489> killing<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> road<00:00:57.030> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
seed and you're not killing the road on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.660 
seed and you're not killing the road on
that<00:00:57.329> plant<00:00:59.660> we're<00:01:00.660> getting<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.640> lot<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that plant we're getting a lot more

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
that plant we're getting a lot more
species<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.199> further<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.890> into

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
species and the further you get into

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.690 
species and the further you get into
especially<00:01:05.580> mob<00:01:06.150> grazing<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:08.159> long<00:01:08.430> rest

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
especially mob grazing with long rest

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210 
especially mob grazing with long rest
period<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.390> amazing<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.350> shows<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
period that's amazing what shows up and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
period that's amazing what shows up and
you<00:01:11.280> eventually<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.360> such<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> healthy

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you eventually you get such a healthy

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.499 
you eventually you get such a healthy
stand<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:15.000> so-called

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
stand that you don't have many so-called

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.810 
stand that you don't have many so-called
weeds<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.500> crowded<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:19.820> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
weeds because they're crowded out you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
weeds because they're crowded out you
can't<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.600> mob<00:01:21.869> grazing

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
can't go to one of these mob grazing

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
can't go to one of these mob grazing
schools<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> go<00:01:23.159> home<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> say<00:01:23.729> well<00:01:23.880> I'm

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
schools and go home and say well I'm

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.510 
schools and go home and say well I'm
gonna<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.810> guys<00:01:25.080> doing

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
gonna do just like this guys doing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
gonna do just like this guys doing
because<00:01:26.689> everybody's<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:28.170> everybody

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
because everybody's different everybody

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.460 
because everybody's different everybody
forms<00:01:29.130> different<00:01:29.460> every<00:01:29.670> base<00:01:29.840> plant<00:01:30.840> species

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
forms different every base plant species

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.330 
forms different every base plant species
are<00:01:31.680> different<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.250> flexible<00:01:37.340> because

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
are different that be flexible because

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
are different that be flexible because
this<00:01:38.460> time<00:01:38.670> goes<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.090> after<00:01:39.509> two<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:39.750> three

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this time goes on after two or three

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.710 
this time goes on after two or three
years<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.560> run<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.829> cows<00:01:41.040> through<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
years if you run your cows through the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.850 
years if you run your cows through the
your<00:01:42.720> best<00:01:42.899> pasture<00:01:43.409> where<00:01:43.560> you've<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
your best pasture where you've got a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
your best pasture where you've got a
good<00:01:44.189> mix<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.670> clovers<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.479> trefoil<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
good mix of clovers and trefoil and the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
good mix of clovers and trefoil and the
different<00:01:47.040> grasses<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.970> let<00:01:48.119> them

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
different grasses and then you let them

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.810 
different grasses and then you let them
carry<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> seed<00:01:49.369> when<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> move<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
carry that seed when you move the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
carry that seed when you move the
movement<00:01:51.299> where<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> need<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> seed

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
movement where you need all that seed

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
movement where you need all that seed
and<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.860> let<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.159> put<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> seed<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and you let them put that seed out there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:43.150 
and you let them put that seed out there
you<00:01:55.110> go

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:52.350 

you
