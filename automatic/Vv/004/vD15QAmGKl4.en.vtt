 Hello, yes, as if we meet 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.990
 to sail on the yacht katarina we 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.220
 go out into the Barents Sea astern 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.719
 there are old so sharpness and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.209
 mysterious by the strategy of din there we are 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.369
 and headed 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.129
 however long and persistently tried 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.179
 penetrate this island that the weather is not 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.320
 allowed anyone to eat 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.410
 did not arrange the teachings of the Kola Bay 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.580
 from our film crew it's all the same 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.369
 succeeded 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.650
 for future family 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.320
 we're wild along with this 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.800
 public organization 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.839
 tv broadcaster 21 holds the people 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.749
 seven wonders on the edge of the world and we are sure that 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.699
 Kildin Island is sure to enter 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.190
 the magnificent seven polar wonders 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.820
 located right at the exit of the building 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 identified yacht katarina who 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.800
 straightens the rusard of this review already 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 after 8 hours Quebec closes 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 this island 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.510
 who replaced him with the traffic accident judge group 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 risk on the one hand and instability 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 as told in the department shares 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 small states and governments to be and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.920
 more children that sometimes it seems that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.480
 here you just boils the experience of stopping 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.310
 splendid cuisine with a scary name 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.400
 makeup 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.420
 but 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 3 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.660
 natural beauty products are included 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.510
 human person in ruins 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.360
 homes largest print supplies 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 military equipment is not so much as he 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.870
 meets extreme 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.010
 don't have to 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 the first people on the island appeared yet 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.980
 in the Neolithic era Atai culture 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.590
 we got a few dozen 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.140
 stone tools but homo sapiens 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.150
 twentieth century left us enormous 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 inheritance traces of the military 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.790
 the fact that these people are not just doomed very 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 long 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.410
 but besides the same person 20 30 years ago 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.210
 still heals wounds 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.399
 plus to this 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.710
 they stop 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.659
 perhaps iron grows earth 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.370
 covered with vegetation 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.620
 most of mo to the essence is the only 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.960
 Wednesdays who are for short north 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.810
 summer has time to cover the multi-colored carpet 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.549
 vertical power bells and 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.340
 Of course in the city the question of power 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 Golden root 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.030
 the most extreme point however 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.710
 in fact, the stalls that year after year 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.860
 Stanislavsky 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 you see that all this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.840
 really impressive is 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.560
 creates 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.290
 absolutely logical Chechen 410 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.480
 visited a unique place 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.690
 there are very few such unique places 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.790
 lands western and eastern transfer 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.810
 customs carrier height 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.799
 hundreds of meters of housing per year 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.469
 similar to 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.059
 the stone from which the island served 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.140
 Unusual edges 24 Baroque soloists 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.190
 not at all like those of whom 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.509
 standing in a polish club 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.449
 There are several versions of the origin 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.009
 Kildin Islands say in one word 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.909
 this test of the kola peninsula which 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.169
 strip 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.820
 others are convinced that the island 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.160
 this center of the Ural mountains 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.330
 the most affordable version 21 is huge 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.290
 a meteorite that slept from the sky over a meteorite 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.920
 whether or not a meteorite of science is unknown for sure 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.030
 how many mysteries keeps in itself and its 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.030
 family in the course of consideration especially 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.220
 protected object of the federal 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.820
