 hello how about youtube friends and here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.259
 I bring you a tutorial on how 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.259
 to download 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.570
 your android mobile devices can 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.620
 be good tablet or smartphone first 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 that everything has to go to the play store 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 after this they have to look for four 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 chalets 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 so 48 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.800
 and that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.890
 already being there they install the 4 chalet 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.460
 and already installed will appear to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.640
 principle a screen like this 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.850
 after this they have to log in 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 have an account I recommend you go to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.200
 computer to register as it is very 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.200
 difficult from a mobile device to do 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:40.840
 this already registered and we all open the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 4 chalet and we look for the next file 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.380
