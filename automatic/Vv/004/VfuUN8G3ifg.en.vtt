of that with in watch dogs make sure

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.290 
of that with in watch dogs make sure
that<00:00:42.679> the<00:00:42.890> city<00:00:43.100> reacts<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:44.149> everything

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that the city reacts to everything

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.569 
that the city reacts to everything
you're<00:00:44.719> doing<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.469> we<00:00:45.920> keep<00:00:46.129> preserve

you're doing and that we keep preserve
that<00:00:46.760> detail<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:47.809> unique<00:00:48.140> through<00:00:48.410> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
that detail that is so unique through a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.979 
that detail that is so unique through a
modern<00:00:48.859> city<00:00:49.519> in<00:00:49.670> North<00:00:49.850> America<00:00:50.269> so<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
modern city in North America so the

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.200 
modern city in North America so the
heart<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.710> same<00:00:52.070> games<00:00:52.309> vision<00:00:52.760> right<00:00:52.969> we

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
heart is the same games vision right we

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.700 
heart is the same games vision right we
were<00:00:53.510> starting<00:00:53.719> from<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.079> vision<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.530> then

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
were starting from a vision and then

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.189 
were starting from a vision and then
disrupt<00:00:55.609> is<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.789> very<00:00:56.030> scalable<00:00:56.600> technology

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
disrupt is a very scalable technology

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.889 
disrupt is a very scalable technology
very<00:00:57.949> scalable<00:00:58.489> game<00:00:58.670> engine<00:00:59.059> so<00:00:59.600> what<00:00:59.749> we're

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
very scalable game engine so what we're

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.049 
very scalable game engine so what we're
doing<00:00:59.929> is<00:01:00.409> we're<00:01:01.309> preserving<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.879> game

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
doing is we're preserving the game

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.120 
doing is we're preserving the game
experience<00:01:02.629> but<00:01:02.870> if<00:01:03.109> you<00:01:03.320> play<00:01:03.530> watch<00:01:03.710> dogs<00:01:03.980> on

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
experience but if you play watch dogs on

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.410 
experience but if you play watch dogs on
the<00:01:04.190> PlayStation<00:01:04.640> 4<00:01:04.820> we<00:01:04.970> want<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.270> make<00:01:05.390> sure

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.970 
the PlayStation 4 we want to make sure
that<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.930> use<00:01:06.080> all<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> consoles

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
that we use all of the consoles

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.580 
that we use all of the consoles
capability<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.150> all<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.810> game<00:01:08.990> spiller<00:01:09.290> were

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
capability so all the game spiller were

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.220 
capability so all the game spiller were
able<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.010> make<00:01:10.190> longer<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.450> stronger<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:12.170> of

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
able to make longer and stronger all of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.500 
able to make longer and stronger all of
the<00:01:12.590> details<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.460> game<00:01:13.670> are<00:01:13.850> able<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.270> push

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
the details in the game are able to push

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.600 
the details in the game are able to push
forward<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:15.410> have<00:01:15.560> more<00:01:15.860> details<00:01:16.070> more

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
forward we have more details more

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.100 
forward we have more details more
immersion<00:01:17.180> we're<00:01:17.330> able<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.750> increase

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
immersion we're able to increase

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.140 
immersion we're able to increase
connectivity<00:01:18.530> increase<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.610> density<00:01:19.790> of

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
connectivity increase the density of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.480 
connectivity increase the density of
things<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:21.290> it's<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> same<00:01:21.560> game<00:01:21.950> experience

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
things so it's the same game experience

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.340 
things so it's the same game experience
but<00:01:23.030> basically<00:01:23.390> magnifying<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.230> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
but basically magnifying on the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.220 
but basically magnifying on the
PlayStation<00:01:24.860> 4<00:01:25.070> it's<00:01:26.060> not<00:01:26.300> just<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.690> capacity

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.360 
PlayStation 4 it's not just a capacity
of<00:01:27.260> new<00:01:27.730> machinery<00:01:28.730> it's<00:01:29.180> also<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.770> capacity

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
of new machinery it's also the capacity

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.580 
of new machinery it's also the capacity
of<00:01:31.400> players<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:32.090> create<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.900> interact<00:01:33.380> to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
of players to create to interact to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.470 
of players to create to interact to
socialize<00:01:34.160> so<00:01:34.790> when<00:01:34.910> we<00:01:35.030> started<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.420> talk

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
socialize so when we started to talk

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.650 
socialize so when we started to talk
about<00:01:35.690> watch<00:01:35.990> dogs<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:37.550> Sony<00:01:37.760> they<00:01:38.270> got<00:01:38.480> it

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
about watch dogs to Sony they got it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.870 
about watch dogs to Sony they got it
immediately<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.100> players<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.730> their

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
immediately it is the players and their

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880 
immediately it is the players and their
behavior<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.780> will<00:01:41.960> actually<00:01:42.140> bring<00:01:42.590> what

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
behavior that will actually bring what

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.060 
behavior that will actually bring what
next-gen<00:01:43.220> actually<00:01:43.940> means<00:01:44.680> we're<00:01:45.680> starting

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
next-gen actually means we're starting

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.610 
next-gen actually means we're starting
to<00:01:46.190> me<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.490> machine<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.600> acknowledge<00:01:48.290> how

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
to me a machine as to acknowledge how

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.970 
to me a machine as to acknowledge how
our<00:01:49.220> society<00:01:49.730> work<00:01:50.330> our<00:01:50.660> people<00:01:51.080> interact

is<00:03:44.630> always<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.470> recognize<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.490> give

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
is always to recognize that and give

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.420 
is always to recognize that and give
more<00:03:47.540> power<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.260> reason<00:03:48.770> like<00:03:49.160> just

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
more power for a reason like just

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.970 
more power for a reason like just
provide<00:03:49.970> more<00:03:50.300> possibilities<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.740> that<00:03:51.890> we

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
provide more possibilities so that we

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.360 
provide more possibilities so that we
can<00:03:52.130> constantly<00:03:52.670> grow<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.560> form<00:03:54.920> of
