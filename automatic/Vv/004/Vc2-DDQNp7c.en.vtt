00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
these are just straightforward small

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
these are just straightforward small
little<00:01:21.689> speakers<00:01:22.170> here's<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> audio<00:01:23.280> jack

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little speakers here's the audio jack

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
little speakers here's the audio jack
just<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.049> mentioned<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.830> green<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
output on the back of your pc and you're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.770 
output on the back of your pc and you're
set<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> here's<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> power<00:01:32.549> plug<00:01:32.909> okay<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
set and here's the power plug okay so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
set and here's the power plug okay so
these<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.229> straightforward<00:01:34.909> nothing<00:01:35.909> else

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
these are straightforward nothing else

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
these are straightforward nothing else
really<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.780> plugging<00:01:37.170> plug<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.860> go

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
really to do just plugging plug and go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
really to do just plugging plug and go
plug<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> play<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:38.939> there's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> audio<00:01:40.229> let's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
plug and play so there's the audio let's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
plug and play so there's the audio let's
play<00:01:41.009> some<00:01:41.280> music<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.299> intro<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
play some music for my intro so you can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
play some music for my intro so you can
see<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:43.799> types<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.159> sound<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
see the different types of sound so you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:02:21.680 
see the different types of sound so you
turn<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.420> volume<00:01:45.810> here

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.690 

so<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> gives<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.200> an<00:02:23.290> idea<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.370> type

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so that gives you an idea on that type

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.330 
so that gives you an idea on that type
of<00:02:24.730> music<00:02:25.030> with<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.680> type<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.709> sound<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
of music with that type of sound and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:03:04.500 
of music with that type of sound and
here's<00:02:27.670> another<00:02:27.909> inch<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.780> use

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.850 

so<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.660> go<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.140> roughly<00:03:06.440> for<00:03:06.680> about

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
so there you go so roughly for about

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.250 
so there you go so roughly for about
twenty<00:03:07.370> dollars<00:03:07.730> right<00:03:07.910> now<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:09.050> can<00:03:09.170> get

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
twenty dollars right now you can get

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.110 
twenty dollars right now you can get
these<00:03:09.440> satellite<00:03:09.860> speakers<00:03:10.310> obviously<00:03:10.970> it

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
these satellite speakers obviously it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.000 
these satellite speakers obviously it
doesn't<00:03:11.300> have<00:03:11.510> heavy<00:03:11.750> bass<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.380> can't<00:03:12.620> expect

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
doesn't have heavy bass you can't expect

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.410 
doesn't have heavy bass you can't expect
