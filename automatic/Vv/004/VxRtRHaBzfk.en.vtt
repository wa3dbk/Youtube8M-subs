00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.510
 Caflisch our fair we spoke for you now a pretty stylish l Alpiq 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.320
 Glass hanging lamp he likes to dark 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.219
 right money 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.919
 And what's more, we need our drill the Paceman drill stand 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.460
 to one 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.829
 wire ropes 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.039
 duct tape 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.669
 and of course to a crete that the light 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.779
 April place 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.480
 In the ideal case, Hamilton gets the cutlery ready 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 already delivered tailored 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.399
 and what we need is this little thing of one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.210
 See Kriesch circle 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 Klara 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.720
 and of course a little traveling fall 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.810
 the right thing is when you put these April glass plates on the push 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.510
 would stick together 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.050
 If I live I could be quite small, we get bigger kids 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 Area they cut on the boys and we do just that with this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.269
 small table saw 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.269
 and how that works the character is 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.310
 comes a hell of a noise 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.500
 for a "wonderful result" 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.060
 as you have already seen 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.240
 it's just cool to cut the important thing is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.430
 only that one runs through as much as possible because the Chrysler scanned 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.800
 fastest at the Mauser frictional resistance no pain 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.149
 for the performance 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.080
 and the lower glare shield 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 we use four small Mittal Steel which we want between the two 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 Insert longitudinal sides 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.530
 to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.560
 Let's do a little so-called LÃ¶scher says 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 These are just small recesses we Bonin says Niklas but just 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.880
 only two bones four feet deep 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 I am very calm 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.540
 wonderful 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.840
 at the second of four meters deep hole 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.080
 what would be going on to see what you can not see from the outside 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.740
 As a next step, the edges should be the customer from Baden 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 important not the currency pairs 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.010
 that can become 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.540
 Grohmann sandpaper from roughly falling 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.659
 as a last step 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.349
 bring INDECA cool that hosts in the edge a phase old one plates 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.000
 known 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.629
 45 degrees angle 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.809
 in the evening 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 it can be broken a sharp 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.769
 to bring together the items country 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.549
 Balingen such a stop on a cantilever jermaine table with swing that 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.309
 easy 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:29.219
 with two necessarily blackened 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.629
 so lay the items properly beautiful tight 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.399
 to the stop 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.859
 As the name implies, it is important that the currency side down 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.399
 shows 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.469
 prove so 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.089
 the items always alternately a short one long one short one 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.699
 long 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.909
 with the lacy side of the fermentation side another 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.389
 if this is quite a stop 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.579
 and then of them 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.259
 can write with the claim 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.269
 He did not think so 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.269
 2 InsO the human 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.189
 generally should 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.109
 makes sense so that everyone stays together 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.369
 next 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.069
 Amelie our two components Kelberg 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.369
 That's very important to the panel 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.649
 put in videos 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.669
 which is very important that we do not contribute too much 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.409
 everything out of me 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.239
 what survives 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.259
 could not remove 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.609
 and you attack the big holes 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.879
 when that happened 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.899
 Plates like the items 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.699
 like such a modular system simply upwards 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.159
 first the short ones 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.840
 then the long shadows the upper one 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.189
 Beirut 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.579
 Fynn that together 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.919
 because I never do 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.919
 and they pull the whole thing too 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.439
 arguing with two children 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.909
 if Massa fixated only dry 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.509
 the stand 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.419
 in addition, consolidation and afterwards 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.569
 included for the app 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.149
 The bring now in the wet state even in this church 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.419
 your Zetterberg Duncan's simply hinder the rods in the Klever 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.239
 When it gets serious about a tribe, nothing is out of it with me 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.749
 this cover plate bit with the glare shield we just put it completely 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:25.919
 Lohse 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.180
 if the hanging lamp hinder 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.180
 next Remedy Rope has been investigating for a long time 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.479
 pretty foil from conducting the gate off 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.920
 left the village so that they do not get a card 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.169
 and as a last step 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.169
 Let's put in each corner my beautiful phase 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.210
 let everything dry hang suspension light bulb 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.409
 and everything to offer 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.210
 she sucks 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.199
 like Ursula's blueprints 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.240
 and I am superb at our wooden table 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 If you have smoker documents you can copy all construction management 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.340
 Per 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.159
 I do not always want to be unique 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.300
 Yes 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.129
 the wonderland or great
