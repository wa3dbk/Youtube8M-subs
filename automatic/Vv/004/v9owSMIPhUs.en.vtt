00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.710
 m 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.189
 hello girls so we end up 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.750
 today for a review of an iron to 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.790
 smooth that I really like a brand 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.920
 that I have in quantity it is about 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.080
 remington and straightener cat a 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.750
 therapy that is a fact she has 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.820
 impregnated with products and who you 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.370
 provides extreme smoothing with 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.370
 Silky and sweet hair is beautiful 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.650
 and feeds them it makes them all 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.059
 benefits of a care in his dresses 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.950
 you do not need you 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.809
 apply something during your 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.520
 smoothing and so it's a bit of a 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.680
 save time so we'll start with 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.390
 a little review of the product and then 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.309
 I will propose you to win this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.480
 produced with a small contest since 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.410
 very generously the brand 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.720
 we offered a hair daily with 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.880
 this product is not just for video 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.860
 I tell you about it I really like them 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 high schools yesterday and I wanted to show you 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.690
 that they are still quite 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.280
 smooth and shiny so really that's great 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.240
 great product so I'm going to you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.009
 explain a little bit how they 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.530
 operate the benefits the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.890
 disadvantages that I have seen this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.560
 product looks like this so it 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.690
 is velvet blue at the Thursday it's done 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.599
 for me I love that make me alice and 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.160
 that goes from 150 to 230 degrees and we can 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.050
 see the temperature with the small screen 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.220
 digital that's just where I find 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.170
 it's very convenient because for example 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840
 in my game hd jay not that and I'm a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410
 little disturbed we can not adjust the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.899
 temperature 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.280
 while there really is super cool 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.840
 you also have a button 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.130
 locking by pressing the least 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.620
 so that's really good 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 so if you 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.470
 to smooth hair does not change 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.120
 temperatures if you press it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.810
 unfortunately it's really 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.210
 cool and he gets to the right temperature 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 pretty quickly nor blinks time he 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.440
 there is no then a little noise so like 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 in a lot of smoothing iron then this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.350
 that I like too is that there is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 ceramic plates and especially 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.770
 his first property is that there is a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.260
 soaked care f1 impregnated in 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.940
 plates that actually make you shine 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.860
 hair and make them stronger and 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.360
 feed them so what I could 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.480
 to note is that especially it is necessary 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.190
 put no serum no hair product 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.810
 who does not rinse after your 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700
 shampoo and your after shampoo because 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.190
 that it's really going to grease them 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.660
 since there are already here in me 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.830
 who has hair that regrets quickly and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.020
 which very fine and very smooth if I put in 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.180
 products before using that it's not going 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.450
 at all you use it on hair come 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.040
 without this loan without his child really 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.550
 nourishing samson otherwise it's okay 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.500
 to regret 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.750
 so in this care there is oil 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 avocado and vitamin e 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.170
 that's actually what gives this 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.150
 shine to the hair then there is also 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.860
 an advantage that I like a lot 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.450
 that the plates are wide and suddenly 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.010
 how does it look you can also 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.360
 well wanted to buckle you high school 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 and I who has the hair anyway 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.459
 pretty smooth naturally I use the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.320
 dollar play a lot for me the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.150
 buckle on the front who had seen me 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.950
 in my video get ready use it so 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.530
 this is a product I like 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.770
 a lot that I use everyday that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.330
 is simple to use that assault 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.620
 not hair and who as and when 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.780
 measurement makes them more and more 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 bright and beautiful so I find that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.920
 it's not insignificant for a device 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.030
 heating which usually the abyss months 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.550
 at the mines table and a brush 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.840
 heating g that I introduced you to 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.430
 the keratin that makes them thicker 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
 with more volume I also like the wait 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.670
 to strike and play happens so that's me 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.390
 now makes three products of the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.400
 brand is really i've never been disappointed 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.800
 so it's a brand that I buy 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.330
 constantly and I find it's a 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.950
 very good alternative to full fill 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.099
 other brands that are much more 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.200

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.720
 and I'm going to make huge kisses 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.580
 and I always have a little trouble with you 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.260
 leave them at the end of the video but 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.260
 this time it's over
