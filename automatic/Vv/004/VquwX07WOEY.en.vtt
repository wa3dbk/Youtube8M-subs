00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.160 

I<00:00:10.129> think<00:00:11.129> the<00:00:11.820> release<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> hearthstone<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
I think the release of hearthstone is is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
I think the release of hearthstone is is
really<00:00:13.320> important<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:13.830> Blizzard<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
really important for Blizzard at a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.859 
really important for Blizzard at a
broader<00:00:16.109> level<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> step<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
broader level it's kind of a step out of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320 
broader level it's kind of a step out of
our<00:00:19.020> comfort<00:00:19.080> zone<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> big

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
our comfort zone it's not all that big

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
our comfort zone it's not all that big
far<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.750> step<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> warcraft<00:00:22.710> game<00:00:22.980> but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
far of a step it's a warcraft game but

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
far of a step it's a warcraft game but
just<00:00:23.850> being<00:00:24.120> so<00:00:24.720> accessible<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
just being so accessible right and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
just being so accessible right and
that's<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.280> exciting<00:00:26.610> previous<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that's really exciting previous to this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.210 
that's really exciting previous to this
you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.110> of<00:00:28.140> our<00:00:28.320> games<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.800> been<00:00:28.920> like

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you know all of our games have been like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
you know all of our games have been like
50<00:00:29.670> plus<00:00:29.880> person<00:00:30.360> teams<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.110> have<00:00:31.199> been

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
50 plus person teams and have been

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799 
50 plus person teams and have been
multi-year<00:00:32.039> development<00:00:32.610> cycles<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> we

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
multi-year development cycles and we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
multi-year development cycles and we
really<00:00:34.050> wanted<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.289> see<00:00:34.469> could<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.129> make<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
really wanted to see could we make a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
really wanted to see could we make a
game<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.670> lived<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.539> our<00:00:36.690> epic<00:00:37.050> standards

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
game that lived up to our epic standards

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
game that lived up to our epic standards
but<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.100> much<00:00:38.280> smaller<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.820> scope<00:00:39.000> we're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
but as much smaller in scope we're

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
but as much smaller in scope we're
loosened<00:00:39.810> up<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
loosened up a little bit and we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.979 
loosened up a little bit and we're
developing<00:00:41.970> you<00:00:42.210> could<00:00:42.360> say<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.690> smaller

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
developing you could say at a smaller

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.080 
developing you could say at a smaller
scale<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> same<00:00:44.310> level<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.760> quality

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
scale but at the same level of quality

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
scale but at the same level of quality
the<00:00:45.300> same<00:00:45.570> level<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> investment<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.680> same

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the same level of investment the same

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.710 
the same level of investment the same
level<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.280> passion<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.880> what<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.540> want

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
level of passion and what we really want

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.299 
level of passion and what we really want
to<00:00:48.809> prove<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.110> ourselves<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.160> could

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to prove to ourselves was that we could

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.190 
to prove to ourselves was that we could
still<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.790> go<00:00:50.910> back<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.390> old<00:00:51.600> garage

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
still kind of go back to that old garage

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.900 
still kind of go back to that old garage
programmer<00:00:52.860> days<00:00:53.130> of<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> small<00:00:53.640> team

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
programmer days of a small team

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.550 
programmer days of a small team
accomplished<00:00:54.420> me<00:00:54.600> something<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.230> fun

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.229 

so<00:01:02.560> we<00:01:02.680> started<00:01:02.980> this<00:01:03.190> team<00:01:03.940> with<00:01:04.120> him

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
so we started this team with him

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.930 
so we started this team with him
blizzard<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.629> we<00:01:04.930> call<00:01:05.140> Team<00:01:05.440> 5<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.070> the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
blizzard that we call Team 5 and the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.120 
blizzard that we call Team 5 and the
whole<00:01:07.120> mandate<00:01:07.540> for<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.810> team<00:01:08.020> was<00:01:08.410> keep<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
whole mandate for the team was keep the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.190 
whole mandate for the team was keep the
team<00:01:09.280> very<00:01:09.520> small<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.660> have<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.960> really

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
team very small and you have to really

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.320 
team very small and you have to really
think<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.740> ways<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.160> develop<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.880> game<00:01:13.060> that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
think of ways to develop a game that

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.730 
think of ways to develop a game that
might<00:01:13.540> be<00:01:13.690> non-traditional<00:01:14.200> with<00:01:14.650> in

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
might be non-traditional with in

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.260 
might be non-traditional with in
blizzards<00:01:15.130> walls<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.700> was<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.910> team<00:01:16.090> those

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
blizzards walls it was a team those

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.030 
blizzards walls it was a team those
particular<00:01:16.690> specifically<00:01:17.260> for<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.590> title

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
particular specifically for this title

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.090 
particular specifically for this title
and<00:01:18.250> we<00:01:18.700> have<00:01:18.790> about<00:01:18.970> 15<00:01:19.930> hardcore<00:01:20.560> ninjas<00:01:20.950> who

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
and we have about 15 hardcore ninjas who

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.680 
and we have about 15 hardcore ninjas who
kind<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.340> jumped<00:01:21.610> on<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:21.910> we<00:01:22.240> really<00:01:22.479> want<00:01:22.630> to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
kind of jumped on this we really want to

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.750 
kind of jumped on this we really want to
get<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.869> team<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.440> were<00:01:23.560> generals<00:01:24.430> they're

necessity you know many of us that got

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.050 
necessity you know many of us that got
our<00:01:34.810> start<00:01:35.050> at<00:01:35.200> blizzard<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.060> glorious

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
our start at blizzard in the glorious

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.930 
our start at blizzard in the glorious
golden<00:01:37.479> age<00:01:37.990> back<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.250> day<00:01:39.399> I'm<00:01:39.610> we<00:01:39.790> all

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
golden age back in the day I'm we all

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.730 
golden age back in the day I'm we all
came<00:01:40.149> up<00:01:40.180> playing<00:01:40.540> magic<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.200> gathering<00:01:41.350> in

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
came up playing magic the gathering in

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.560 
came up playing magic the gathering in
Jihad<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.369> all<00:01:42.580> sorts<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:42.970> card<00:01:43.180> games<00:01:43.240> when

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
Jihad and all sorts of card games when

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.940 
Jihad and all sorts of card games when
that<00:01:43.690> when<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:43.930> scene<00:01:44.229> was<00:01:44.380> really<00:01:44.619> blow<00:01:44.830> it

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
that when that scene was really blow it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.650 
that when that scene was really blow it
up<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.640> think<00:01:45.910> there's<00:01:46.180> something<00:01:46.390> really

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
up so I think there's something really

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.480 
up so I think there's something really
fundamental<00:01:47.560> about<00:01:47.920> TCG's<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:50.350> our<00:01:50.530> shop<00:01:50.860> any
