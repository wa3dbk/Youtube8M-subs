00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 spontaneously filmed with my phone and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 while I'm in the streets of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 very strange and mysterious and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.879
 now again and I would say 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 I'll just go a little closer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 so you really even see and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 it could get dark now 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 but also a little louder and that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.449

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.449

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.590
