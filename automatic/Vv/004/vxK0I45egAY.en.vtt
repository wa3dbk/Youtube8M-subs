get to 2000 of any one of these three

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
get to 2000 of any one of these three
shard<00:00:40.140> types<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> free<00:00:41.790> crystal<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
shard types you get a free crystal that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.319 
shard types you get a free crystal that
is<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.079> cool<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.469> basically<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:45.270> is

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
right here now those are just the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950 
right here now those are just the
standard<00:01:58.799> premium<00:01:59.310> crystal<00:02:00.000> shards<00:02:00.659> right

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
standard premium crystal shards right

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
standard premium crystal shards right
there<00:02:01.290> which<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.549> exciting<00:02:03.149> frankly

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
there which is not that exciting frankly

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
there which is not that exciting frankly
but<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.380> starting<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.890> into

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
but here we're starting to get into

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550 
but here we're starting to get into
silver<00:02:05.579> crystals<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.079> one<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.469> would

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
silver crystals and the one that would

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
silver crystals and the one that would
be<00:02:07.710> really<00:02:08.009> important<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> course<00:02:08.849> would<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
be really important of course would be

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.890 
be really important of course would be
the<00:02:09.720> golden<00:02:10.140> ones<00:02:10.410> let's<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.330> 50

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the golden ones let's see so that's a 50

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
the golden ones let's see so that's a 50
golden<00:02:13.379> one

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
golden one

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.810 
golden one
here<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.070> puts<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.700> bit

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
here so that puts you a little bit

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.570 
here so that puts you a little bit
closer<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.720> 2000<00:02:16.560> number<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.400> open

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
closer to that 2000 number we can open

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.990 
closer to that 2000 number we can open
up<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.110> guaranteed<00:02:19.190> four<00:02:20.190> star<00:02:20.490> character

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
up a guaranteed four star character

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.660 
up a guaranteed four star character
that's<00:02:21.570> not<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.020> bad<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.190> they've

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that's not so bad right so they've

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's not so bad right so they've
opened<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.750> take<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> look<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.500> these

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
opened up that now take a look at these

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
opened up that now take a look at these
new<00:02:26.270> versus<00:02:27.270> events<00:02:27.780> there's<00:02:28.400> two<00:02:29.400> things

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
new versus events there's two things

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
new versus events there's two things
that<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.330> interesting<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.050> you've

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
that are really interesting if you've

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.140 
that are really interesting if you've
got<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> ton<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> pim<00:02:32.160> canisters<00:02:32.820> you're<00:02:33.030> gonna

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
got a ton of pim canisters you're gonna

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.250 
got a ton of pim canisters you're gonna
want<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> come<00:02:33.390> over<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.050> two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
want to come over to one of these two

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.760 
want to come over to one of these two
events<00:02:34.380> right<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.540> not<00:02:36.540> only<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.620> two

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
events right here and not only get a two

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.040 
events right here and not only get a two
star<00:02:38.340> yellow<00:02:38.700> jacket<00:02:39.210> which<00:02:39.510> would<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
star yellow jacket which would be the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
star yellow jacket which would be the
34th<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.980> start<00:02:41.250> character<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:41.940> been

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
34th to start character that's been

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.520 
34th to start character that's been
available<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> game<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.230> want<00:02:43.440> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
available in the game you want to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.980 
available in the game you want to
collect<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.640> dupe<00:02:44.910> him<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.810> also

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
collect that you can dupe him but also

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.170 
collect that you can dupe him but also
in<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.190> easy<00:02:47.460> ways<00:02:47.790> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
in here there's really easy ways of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.110 
in here there's really easy ways of
getting<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.810> three<00:02:49.440> star<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:50.760> getting

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
getting a three star and then getting

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.170 
getting a three star and then getting
him<00:02:51.480> duped<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.770> not<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.160> far<00:02:53.460> away<00:02:53.610> now

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
him duped which is not that far away now

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
him duped which is not that far away now
this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.930> how<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.380> works<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:55.980> character

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
this is how it works when the character

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.760 
this is how it works when the character
is<00:02:56.550> blue<00:02:57.000> doubt<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.290> means<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
is blue doubt like this that means that

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.070 
is blue doubt like this that means that
they<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.070> only<00:02:59.340> get<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.700> signature<00:03:00.210> level<00:03:00.780> one

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
they will only get a signature level one

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080 
they will only get a signature level one
and<00:03:01.110> there<00:03:01.590> will<00:03:01.740> be<00:03:01.860> no<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.610> eight<00:03:02.790> for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and there will be no I so eight for

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.960 
and there will be no I so eight for
duping<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.020> basically<00:03:04.490> like<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.550> non

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
duping it so it's basically like a non

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.570 
duping it so it's basically like a non
doop<00:03:06.390> doop<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.680> if<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> already<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
doop doop so if you already have the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.430 
doop doop so if you already have the
character<00:03:09.060> those<00:03:09.240> rewards<00:03:09.480> are<00:03:09.990> not<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
character those rewards are not going to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.880 
character those rewards are not going to
be<00:03:10.530> very<00:03:10.560> exciting<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.240> don't<00:03:12.510> have

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
be very exciting but if you don't have

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.610 
be very exciting but if you don't have
ant-man<00:03:13.890> or<00:03:14.400> ant-man<00:03:15.200> duplicated<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.530> at

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
ant-man or ant-man duplicated you can at

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
ant-man or ant-man duplicated you can at
least<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:17.070> them<00:03:17.190> duplicated<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.090> level<00:03:18.510> one

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
least get them duplicated to level one

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.740 
least get them duplicated to level one
and<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.950> okay<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.490> no<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.150> eight<00:03:21.330> reward

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
and that's okay but no I so eight reward

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.090 
and that's okay but no I so eight reward
anything<00:03:22.020> like<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.680> don't<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:22.980> an

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
anything like that if you don't have an

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.680 
anything like that if you don't have an
ant-man<00:03:23.310> or<00:03:23.730> yellow<00:03:24.090> jacket<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
ant-man or yellow jacket and a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.780 
ant-man or yellow jacket and a
three-star<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.830> really<00:03:26.220> really<00:03:26.490> really

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
three-star this is really really really

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.720 
three-star this is really really really
really<00:03:26.940> easy<00:03:27.450> way<00:03:28.070> 120,000<00:03:29.070> points<00:03:29.460> I<00:03:29.550> don't

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
really easy way 120,000 points I don't

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.670 
really easy way 120,000 points I don't
even<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.970> if<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.420> play<00:03:30.690> ten

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
even know if you have to play ten

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.320 
even know if you have to play ten
battles<00:03:32.070> or<00:03:32.250> something<00:03:32.610> it'd<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.210> easy

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
battles or something it'd be really easy

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.380 
battles or something it'd be really easy
to<00:03:33.630> get<00:03:33.720> 120,000<00:03:34.680> maybe<00:03:35.340> five<00:03:35.700> battles<00:03:36.270> I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
to get 120,000 maybe five battles I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.480 
to get 120,000 maybe five battles I
don't<00:03:36.600> know<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.470> also<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
don't know and then also in the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.360 
don't know and then also in the
four-star<00:03:39.030> arena<00:03:39.470> also<00:03:40.470> very<00:03:40.740> cool<00:03:41.040> take<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
four-star arena also very cool take a
