materials<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.710> I<00:03:02.950> don't<00:03:03.790> know<00:03:04.000> kind<00:03:04.360> of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
materials just like I don't know kind of

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.160 
materials just like I don't know kind of
feels<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.660> something<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.960> would<00:03:05.020> like

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
feels like something you would like

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.310 
feels like something you would like
scrub<00:03:05.530> your<00:03:05.710> dishes<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.210> instead<00:03:08.140> I've

scrub your dishes with so instead I've

scrub your dishes with so instead I've
just<00:03:08.530> been<00:03:08.650> using<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.130> winter<00:03:09.490> gloves<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
just been using like winter gloves and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.450 
just been using like winter gloves and
that's<00:03:11.320> worked<00:03:11.530> for<00:03:11.740> me<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.040> far<00:03:12.250> but

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
that's worked for me so far but

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.860 
that's worked for me so far but
obviously<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.060> not<00:03:13.180> going<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> provide<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
obviously it's not going to provide the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.450 
obviously it's not going to provide the
same<00:03:14.050> amount<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.410> protection<00:03:14.950> against<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
same amount of protection against the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.610 
same amount of protection against the
heat<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:16.360> something<00:03:17.170> that's<00:03:17.260> actually

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
heat that something that's actually

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.000 
heat that something that's actually
designed<00:03:17.770> for<00:03:18.040> heat<00:03:18.370> would<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:20.260> mean<00:03:20.740> if<00:03:20.890> you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
designed for heat would so I mean if you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.410 
designed for heat would so I mean if you
can<00:03:21.160> tolerate<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.700> definitely<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.330> go

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
can tolerate this definitely just go

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.730 
can tolerate this definitely just go
with<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.630> one<00:03:22.840> also<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.290> know<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.530> can

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
with this one also I know you can

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.470 
with this one also I know you can
purchase<00:03:23.980> thicker

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
purchase thicker

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.590 
purchase thicker
I<00:03:25.600> don't<00:03:26.560> know<00:03:26.620> heat<00:03:26.890> protectant<00:03:27.460> gloves<00:03:27.730> from

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
I don't know heat protectant gloves from

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.170 
I don't know heat protectant gloves from
different<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.470> hair<00:03:29.890> retailers<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.850> online

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
different like hair retailers and online

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.150

and stuff like that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.260 
and stuff like that
so<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.400> that's<00:03:33.520> something<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.940> want<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.150> look

I really like it so my whole head was

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.680 
I really like it so my whole head was
done<00:03:51.190> just<00:03:51.220> with<00:03:51.550> this<00:03:51.730> curling<00:03:52.030> iron<00:03:52.300> usually

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
done just with this curling iron usually

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.600 
done just with this curling iron usually
when<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.260> curl<00:03:53.770> my<00:03:53.800> hair<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.100> have<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.400> use<00:03:54.490> my

when I curl my hair I have to use my

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.400 
when I curl my hair I have to use my
flat<00:03:54.850> iron<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:55.180> some<00:03:55.540> sections<00:03:55.960> because<00:03:56.290> my

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
flat iron for some sections because my

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.630 
flat iron for some sections because my
curling<00:03:56.710> iron<00:03:56.770> doesn't<00:03:57.070> really<00:03:57.370> curl

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
curling iron doesn't really curl
