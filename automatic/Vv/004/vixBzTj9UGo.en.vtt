00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.740 

now<00:03:29.189> we're<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.579> electronics<00:03:30.269> labs<00:03:30.480> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
now we're in our electronics labs and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.819 
now we're in our electronics labs and
this<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:30.989> actually<00:03:31.319> one<00:03:31.439> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> coolest

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829

this is actually one of the coolest
spots<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.430> building<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.879> think<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.629> our

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
spots in the building I think it's our

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.839 
spots in the building I think it's our
anechoic<00:03:34.290> chamber<00:03:34.829> which<00:03:35.010> means<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.459> echo

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
anechoic chamber which means it's echo

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.380 
anechoic chamber which means it's echo
proof<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:36.959> also<00:03:37.140> soundproof<00:03:38.390> anybody's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
proof and it's also soundproof anybody's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.410 
proof and it's also soundproof anybody's
really<00:03:40.140> heavy<00:03:40.470> doors<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.640> come<00:03:41.849> on<00:03:42.000> in

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
really heavy doors so come on in

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.289 
really heavy doors so come on in
so<00:03:43.290> inside<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.980> anechoic<00:03:44.519> chamber<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.120> where

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
so inside this anechoic chamber is where

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.119 
so inside this anechoic chamber is where
we<00:03:45.420> do<00:03:45.569> all<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.810> our<00:03:46.019> audio<00:03:46.439> testing<00:03:46.980> we<00:03:47.099> test

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
we do all of our audio testing we test

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.670 
we do all of our audio testing we test
loud<00:03:47.549> speakers<00:03:48.120> we<00:03:48.599> also<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:48.989> all<00:03:49.170> audio

loud speakers we also do all audio
quality<00:03:49.950> testing<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.760> our<00:03:50.790> camcorders<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.750> if

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
quality testing on our camcorders and if

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
quality testing on our camcorders and if
you<00:03:52.290> look<00:03:52.470> around<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:52.920> see<00:03:53.220> all<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.430> these

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you look around you can see all of these

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030 
you look around you can see all of these
crazy<00:03:54.359> baffles<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.290> they're<00:03:55.379> stuffed<00:03:55.769> with

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
crazy baffles and they're stuffed with

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.069 
crazy baffles and they're stuffed with
fast<00:03:56.489> stuff<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.970> really<00:03:57.180> absorbs<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.780> sound

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
fast stuff that really absorbs the sound

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.050 
fast stuff that really absorbs the sound
so<00:03:58.379> you're<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:58.650> hearing<00:03:58.890> anything<00:03:59.220> else<00:03:59.549> but

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
so you're not hearing anything else but

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.180 
so you're not hearing anything else but
the<00:04:00.209> sound<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.750> speakers<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.739> this<00:04:04.980> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
the sound of the speakers so this is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.849 
the sound of the speakers so this is
team<00:04:05.670> R<00:04:05.879> he<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.780> our<00:04:06.959> right-hand<00:04:07.409> man<00:04:07.620> when

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
team R he is our right-hand man when

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.860 
team R he is our right-hand man when
we're<00:04:07.980> testing<00:04:08.340> headphones<00:04:08.879> he's<00:04:09.359> got<00:04:09.569> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
we're testing headphones he's got a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.929 
we're testing headphones he's got a
removable<00:04:10.319> ear<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:12.389> removable<00:04:13.109> head<00:04:13.939> for

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
removable ear and a removable head for

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.960 
removable ear and a removable head for
all<00:04:15.030> sorts<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.450> different<00:04:15.810> kinds<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.139> tests

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
all sorts of different kinds of tests

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.159 
all sorts of different kinds of tests
it's<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.150> one<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.479> many<00:04:18.630> things<00:04:18.959> that

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
it's just one of the many things that

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.290 
it's just one of the many things that
are<00:04:19.349> weird<00:04:19.829> in<00:04:20.099> our<00:04:20.430> labs<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:23.789> we're<00:04:24.060> actually

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
are weird in our labs so we're actually

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.719 
are weird in our labs so we're actually
lucky<00:04:24.690> enough<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.229> have<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> cafeteria<00:04:26.190> here<00:04:26.460> so

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
lucky enough to have a cafeteria here so

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.339 
lucky enough to have a cafeteria here so
we<00:04:26.880> never<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:27.449> leave<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.080> can<00:04:28.199> keep

we never have to leave and we can keep

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.100 
we never have to leave and we can keep
testing<00:04:28.830> for<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.449> you<00:04:30.449> get<00:04:30.599> anything<00:04:30.870> you

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
testing for you you get anything you

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.439 
testing for you you get anything you
want<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.650> actually<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.639> really<00:04:33.150> like<00:04:33.180> the
