00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 remember store sat down case. No, I tell you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.890
 recently told him so now 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.929
 there is an action random key steam 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 and you can buy for only 20 rubles 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.120
 activate and get the game I for example 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 I know few games in the incentive that costs 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.340
 cheaper than 20 rubles so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.859
 parse in the red just do not find yourself well 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 now let's watch a video for everyone 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.380
 hi ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 my name is bender and today we will spend 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 comparison comparison cards will be a little bit 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 philosophize and choose which one 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 map better let's get a little background 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 Let's start with the fact that I set myself a mod 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 minecraft which will add exactly this 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 the most mikroft card called 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.820
 but this from you this is not even an atlas map and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 let's go back a little bit and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 let's see what we already have minecraft 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 After all, mykrafte anyway already have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.129
 map and let's look at it 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 actually need to activate it 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 it is activated looks as follows 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 way let's look at the pros and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.309
 cons of this card + and it is very clear 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.290
 it displays straight top view 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.530
 on it you can understand where what color 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.780
 blocks and that's good enough like me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 it seems from the minuses I can say something 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.580
 the map captures only a small area 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.200
 area if you go somewhere far away 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.659
 Here, for example in that direction and now 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 let's go then the card will stop showing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.170
 we are the site 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 but it will simply display the point in that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.180
 the side we are in is not 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.579
 very cool because every time you do 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 new maps seems to me enough 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 difficult but this card still has 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.240
 one plus I think this 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.189
 you can hang it on the wall for this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.229
 need a decorative frame 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.159
 special can at home made yourself 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.680
 stenochku 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.810
 not hang the card can be combined 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 several cards and then you can make 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 whole 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 map of the mainland for example using here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.189
 of these cards here but it's all enough 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 as little as it seems to me 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.430
 primitive 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 it can be weighed and everything is enough 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.810
 looks nice here we even 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 moving on these maps where we look 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 it shows where we look in 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.940
 general and where we will translate very 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.980
 it is generally convenient to do everything with the help of these 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.410
 cards can be understood for example at your home 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.870
 hangs this card for example I went somewhere 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.730
 in a cave a friend looked and found in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.890
 Generally it is the cards that were in 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.860
 minecraft everyone knows them and now I 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.989
 I will show you a new card that is 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.390
 Maykraft it even faster and atlas 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.030
 let's see how it works this 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.739
 you will need such a little book 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.350
 poke the right mouse button and see that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.569
 we got an atlas number zero 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.000
 strange why they are numbered from the number 0 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.150
 but this number 0 is now poking right 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.530
 click and voila so here 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 this atlas looks like 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.269
 he actually looks quite 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.400
 in a different way as you will see this card more 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.310
 seems to know some kind of pirate 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.260
 treasure map and this is true 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 we can move around with this card 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.459
 here we are shown as such 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.280
 arrows and it also shows where 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.230
 Reiki is located where is the forest where 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.500
 there is a highland where 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.660
 is palm trees and so on from the pros 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 of this map I can mark the markers on 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.640
 it can put markers and they look 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 very cool i'll show you now let's 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.540
 add a marker here and will not and not as 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.489
 call but that looks like 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.680
 really like some kind of pirate 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.840
 treasure map and and with this you can 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.880
 make a special atlas and give 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.280
 to their friends and let them search whether you know 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.100
 you treasure also map enough 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.840
 exact that is if somewhere wood is there 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.420
 there really will be a forest well and she 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.630
 done in style I really like 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.700
 this style is the style of cards for heroes 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.920
 the heroes of the third there cards were about 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.530
 same but there were no flowers and there is 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.590
 control arrows like 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.840
 children and this card is not required 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.550
 sorry you don't need to update then 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.860
 you don't need to craft yet 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.560
 one card this atom can make 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.170
 once and all the time to walk with him so 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.720
 what seems to me this card is also worthy 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.390
 Attention more precisely atlas can also be 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.489
 export this image and this 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.430
 you will have the card as a picture in 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.060
 folder. Mycroft is also enough 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.470
 well you can fold the png file and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.079
 his friends Well picture fold 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.570
 friends and let them in the picture for example 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.880
 guided in general, such you know 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.830
 Is good too, it seems to me like a map and 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.080
 now friends let's make a small 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.540
