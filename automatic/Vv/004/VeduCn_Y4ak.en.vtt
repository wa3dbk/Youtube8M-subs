the<00:01:07.680> stuff<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> random<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.520> sometimes<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the stuff is random and sometimes you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
the stuff is random and sometimes you
the<00:01:09.420> game<00:01:09.600> bull<00:01:09.810> shits<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.010> every

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the game bull shits on you but not every

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.810 
the game bull shits on you but not every
single<00:01:11.640> kill<00:01:12.710> what<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:13.920> happen<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.580> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
single kill what would happen if they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
single kill what would happen if they
actually<00:01:15.000> made<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> perfect<00:01:15.900> call<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> duty

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
actually made a perfect call of duty

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
actually made a perfect call of duty
game<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.860> impossible<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.509> idea<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
game it's impossible because my idea of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
game it's impossible because my idea of
a<00:01:19.049> perfect<00:01:19.229> call<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> duty<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> different

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
a perfect call of duty game is different

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.640 
a perfect call of duty game is different
from<00:01:20.759> yours<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.110> everyone<00:01:22.380> else

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
from yours different from everyone else

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
from yours different from everyone else
so<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.070> impossible<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> perfect

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so it's impossible to make a perfect

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.780 
so it's impossible to make a perfect
game<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.840> let's<00:01:25.049> say<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.340> sake<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
game but let's say just for the sake of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.100 
game but let's say just for the sake of
argument<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.450> didn't<00:01:27.630> make<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> perfect

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
argument that we didn't make a perfect

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
argument that we didn't make a perfect
game<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.100> happened<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.479> made

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
game you know what happened if we made

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510
