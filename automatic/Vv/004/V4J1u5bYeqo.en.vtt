00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.260
We say goodbye to beautiful Kalamata,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100
we have checked - in using the Aegean iPad app

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.600
and we are about to drop - off our luggage

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.580
and then get on the plane to Munich.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.655
Here we are at the heart of Bavaria.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.200
We are in the central square of Munich, called Marienplatz,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.080
ie the square of Virgin Mary.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
What you see behind me is the City Hall.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.700
This square is the central Munich square from 1158.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.760
This is Gaertnerplatz, a recreational oasis in the heart of Munich.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.140
It's a small pretty square,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.920
in which a lot of people gather, especially in the weekends, 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
who come here to lie down,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.420
grab some sun,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.740
drink a beer

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.760
and relax.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.240
I am at the historic Paulaner brewery.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.760
The famous German beer is part of Munich's tradition,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.500
since it started being produced in 1634

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.580
from the monks of the St Francis of Paola.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.380
Thus called Paulaner.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.420
These vats contain all the materials for the fermentation and production of the beer.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
This factory here

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
produces 1 million litres of beer per day.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.820
The Paulaner factory

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.940
is the biggest beer production factory in Bavaria.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320
And so hundreds of tourists visit it daily.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.100
Cheers!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780
Haus der kunst - the house of art.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
At this time, the museum presents a photography exhibition of Stan Douglas

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.160
and an installation by Sammlung Goetz.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.540
