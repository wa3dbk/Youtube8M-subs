00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 but it was a phrase of those hobbits to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 professional level will have wanted if the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.000
 let's see what gerardo said 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.230
 showing the most cheerful 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.119
 witty and playful and greenish 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.300
 fovissste appeared in the box boba and 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.380
 put an end to either the commented binge 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.169
 reconciliation that would reunite it in the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.570
 table with mario pergolini cortito rivers and 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.490
 our bete casella in addition between 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.589
 things and others did not want to stop throwing 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.050
 some stick to marcelo hugo and how 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.839
 then held defenestrÃ³ once more 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.309
 the castrated benthos and tried to fight 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:38.309
 with the least amount of people possible 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 irreconcilable to fight with several 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.699
 no more code if you give me a name 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.449
 that you meet with pergolini you take the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.609
 peak was a pleasant surprise when 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.670
 the last time he had pergolini in what 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.010
 de rial told him he did not want to be more 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.120
 fought that he wanted to cook our 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.740
 sausage me 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.200
 this real solution to be casella that is 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.890
 a great friend of mine that I come because you 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 I want 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 Now if I love you, I'm waiting 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.470
 that impossible once for all wanted 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.640
 hard-boiled egg 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.640
 mario convinced 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:44.040
 showmatch with me 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.040
 the current jury to cross it 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.090
 let's repeat it I think it's a 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.920
 I have said that jealousy 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 transformed into a perverse puppeteer 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.570
 I think it's a mess and because 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.340
 handles the puppets to presiente made 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.520
 the same thing that now I change but every time 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 plus 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.820
 with a meat grinder the television 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.820
 It's a meat grinder 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.980
 you like watching on TV hold me 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.980
 It's fun to see veto 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.989
 blessed I gave me belle of much 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.670
 among these reconciliations that we have 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.950
 reviewing gone over night there 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.950
 some pending husband 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.050
 if it occurs in this scene of mario 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.350
 this doubt would be adventure in tour and 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.350
 fight 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.370
 ventura committed suicide 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.049
 impossible adventure 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.020
 it's like saying that it gives me luck 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.510
 he committed suicide 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.670
 sorry very miserable this man 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.440
 of ravine 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 mainly because I was telling you by 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 feeling unpunished is a poor unhappy and 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.040
 he knows he was left alone talking about people 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.240
 great that has to do with the world 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.740
 of the show one of the great 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.050
 creators sofovich although to the wake 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.400
 do not go there I'll kick the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.900
 crate I know what it is I'm going to go to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 kick is that I did not want me to die 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.570
 I will live to acquire apathy the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.250
 drawer 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.680
 He said he was waiting for me to die 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.710
 to come kick my drawer what 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.840
 it really amazed me and caused me 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.420
 admiration for that I say for the subtlety 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.400
 for the fine glory then I tell you of 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.820
 where is that if chronologically what 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.330
 logical that I go before him but 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.870
 know what happens chirolita 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.960
 nobody has bought life and if well 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.790
 I took you a few years old 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.610
 I have very low cholesterol things that I think 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.590
 that you have and the variables of the 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.950
 Checks that I submit regularly 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.920
 they are excellent out there who tells you 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.220
 as nobody has life bought you 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.600
 touches leave me voice to that success does not 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.040
 It is a journalist but I do not know why 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.530
 others when they publish in all 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.140
 means in the journalist if it's a 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.360
 pandering dealer or if it's a 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:49.510
 high high panhandling trafficker 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.610
 Would you come back and help them a new 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.080
 media like sofovich wanted to leave in 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.390
 clear one more time than the others with 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.130
 perchance no return need not 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.870
 what with the chimentero for a while not 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.610
 you can not even see and it seems that any 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.800
 reason is good to throw yourself a little 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.080
 more than land itself so they were in 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.390
 a stop to follow the dance a long 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.390
 while don and ventura committed suicide 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.360
 ay that serves for the height of the source 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.520
 my son the last gender check is 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.830
 impeccable 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 a lot of time 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.030
 now what a thing is not like TV is not 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.950
 God says it for nothing in particular 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.080
 but it's like a description also of 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.990
 what is the world of TV gave it 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.360
 by retired there on a tape that we saw 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.200
 adventures about gerardo a big man 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.910
 retired today that I know temporarily 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.300
 can tomorrow can be again I hope 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:48.310
 adventures ran out of intruders and shines 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.780
 on channel 13 showing how it looks 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.320
 return the asset as are the laps the 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.320
 life nothing more 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.450
 but this taste 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.450
 because I want
