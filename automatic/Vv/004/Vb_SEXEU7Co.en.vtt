today<00:00:00.420> on<00:00:00.599> draw<00:00:00.780> stuff<00:00:01.020> real<00:00:01.260> easy<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.680> are

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
today on draw stuff real easy we are

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.599 
today on draw stuff real easy we are
drawing<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.280> planets<00:00:02.730> Saturn<00:00:04.339> to<00:00:05.339> drill

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
drawing the planets Saturn to drill

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.509 
drawing the planets Saturn to drill
Saturn<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.330> need<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:07.049> circle<00:00:09.290> and<00:00:10.290> then<00:00:11.099> you're

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
Saturn you need a circle and then you're

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.849 
Saturn you need a circle and then you're
going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.790> need<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.500> ellipse<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
going to need an ellipse so that's the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
going to need an ellipse so that's the
center<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> circle<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.390> ellipse<00:00:18.869> will<00:00:19.140> go

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
center of the circle the ellipse will go

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.300 
center of the circle the ellipse will go
and<00:00:19.859> around<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.160> then<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and around it like that and then you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
and around it like that and then you
want<00:00:23.400> another<00:00:23.789> ellipse<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.660> going

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
want another ellipse and this is going

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.560 
want another ellipse and this is going
to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> thinner<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.939> thicker

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to be kind of thinner there and thicker

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.179 
to be kind of thinner there and thicker
at<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> edges<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> going

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
at the edges so it's kind of going

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:40.459 
at the edges so it's kind of going
something<00:00:32.189> along<00:00:34.460> those<00:00:35.460> lines<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> then

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
something along those lines and then

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
something along those lines and then
you're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> draw<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> top

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you're going to want to draw the top

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.830 
you're going to want to draw the top
part<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.660> Saturn<00:00:46.640> like<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
part of Saturn like that and then you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.650 
part of Saturn like that and then you
can<00:00:49.110> draw<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:51.420> part<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> ring<00:00:54.710> there

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
can draw this part of the ring there

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.680 
can draw this part of the ring there
then<00:00:57.770> go<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> way<00:00:59.399> around

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.679 

draw<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> outer<00:01:04.199> ring<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:06.479> can

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
draw the outer ring and then you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
draw the outer ring and then you can
draw<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.500> bottom<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> planet<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
draw the bottom of the planet when you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
draw the bottom of the planet when you
are<00:01:09.240> sure<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.110> ink<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.650> dry<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.549> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
are sure that the ink is dry you can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.380 
are sure that the ink is dry you can
erase<00:01:12.420> those<00:01:12.810> pencil<00:01:13.590> lines<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.210> you're

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
erase those pencil lines and you're

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
erase those pencil lines and you're
going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.840> some<00:01:16.310> shading<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:18.270> give<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:19.640> bit

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to want some shading to give a bit

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.480 
going to want some shading to give a bit
of<00:01:20.759> 3d<00:01:21.119> nurse<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> planet<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.009> then

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
of 3d nurse to the planet there and then

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.960 
of 3d nurse to the planet there and then
you're<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.330> shading

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
you're also going to want shading

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.520 
you're also going to want shading
underneath<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> ring<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
underneath the ring there like that and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
underneath the ring there like that and
then<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> put<00:01:32.909> rings

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
then if you want to kind of put rings

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
then if you want to kind of put rings
inside<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.079> you've<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> kind

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
inside it then you've really got to kind

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
inside it then you've really got to kind
of<00:01:35.130> plan<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of plan this out that these are going to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.039 
of plan this out that these are going to
be<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> middle<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
be going the middle one will be going to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
be going the middle one will be going to
the<00:01:40.170> center<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> might<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> kind<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the center so you might want to kind of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789 
the center so you might want to kind of
do<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.540> pencil<00:01:43.110> first<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.619> it's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
do this in pencil first because it's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.560 
do this in pencil first because it's
easy<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.930> looking<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> mess

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
easy to get it looking a bit of a mess

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
easy to get it looking a bit of a mess
and<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> then

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and so put kind of one in there and then

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
and so put kind of one in there and then
you<00:01:52.079> might<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.380> want<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> go<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> way<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you might not want to go all the way to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
you might not want to go all the way to
the<00:01:53.430> edge<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.950> first<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the edge so you can put that first and a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.550 
the edge so you can put that first and a
ring<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.469> there<00:02:01.729> fitting<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.750> then

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
ring in there fitting in there and then

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.370 
ring in there fitting in there and then
if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.670> probably<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.479> squeeze<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
if you probably can just squeeze that in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.999 
if you probably can just squeeze that in
there<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.860> these<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> want<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
there but these are going to want to

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.020 
there but these are going to want to
but<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.610> middle<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.990> each<00:02:13.730> space<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
but in the middle of each space if you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.540 
but in the middle of each space if you
follow<00:02:15.390> what<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> mean

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
follow what I mean

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
follow what I mean
and<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.000> maybe<00:02:18.210> break<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> line<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and you can maybe break up the line a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.100 
and you can maybe break up the line a
bit<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:19.950> well<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> put

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
bit as well if you want you want to put

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.800 
bit as well if you want you want to put
in<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.790> don't<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> fill<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in more you don't have to fill in the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.440 
in more you don't have to fill in the
whole<00:02:25.020> space<00:02:25.410> filling<00:02:26.340> whether<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.940> room<00:02:27.209> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
whole space filling whether is room I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.290 
whole space filling whether is room I
tilt<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> does<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.040> look<00:02:29.190> better<00:02:29.220> hmm

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
tilt it does that look better hmm

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.270 
tilt it does that look better hmm
well<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> hope<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.380> enjoyed<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.070> if<00:02:32.160> you
