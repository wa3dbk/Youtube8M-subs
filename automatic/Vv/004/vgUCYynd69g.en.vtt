step3<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:16.610> primary<00:00:17.180> stage<00:00:18.010> now<00:00:19.090> we've<00:00:20.090> sanded

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
step3 the primary stage now we've sanded

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.769 
step3 the primary stage now we've sanded
we've<00:00:21.890> prepped<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.400> material<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.119> now<00:00:23.720> we

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
we've prepped the material and now we

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.410 
we've prepped the material and now we
applied<00:00:24.259> our<00:00:24.439> primary<00:00:24.980> here's<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.060> reason

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
applied our primary here's the reason

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.800 
applied our primary here's the reason
why<00:00:26.450> we<00:00:27.320> primer<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.070> material<00:00:28.610> either<00:00:29.300> in<00:00:29.660> a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
why we primer the material either in a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.690 
why we primer the material either in a
pale<00:00:30.349> yellow<00:00:30.649> which<00:00:31.009> is<00:00:31.130> what<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.460> see<00:00:31.669> here

for you to get an even consistent color

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.390 
for you to get an even consistent color
between<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.970> resin<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.050> wood<00:00:48.290> we<00:00:48.980> primer

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
between the resin and the wood we primer

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.240 
between the resin and the wood we primer
everything<00:00:49.940> first<00:00:50.210> now<00:00:50.930> what<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:51.410> does<00:00:51.470> this

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
everything first now what this does this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.400 
everything first now what this does this
actually<00:00:52.550> will<00:00:52.940> seal<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.780> pores<00:00:54.080> of<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.350> wood

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
actually will seal the pores of the wood

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.220 
actually will seal the pores of the wood
and<00:00:54.800> all<00:00:55.430> fine<00:00:55.760> finishers<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:56.930> they<00:00:57.050> ever

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
and all fine finishers when they ever

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.280 
and all fine finishers when they ever
apply<00:00:57.740> a<00:00:57.770> stain<00:00:58.250> they<00:00:58.910> always<00:00:59.090> seal<00:00:59.810> the<00:01:00.110> wood

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
apply a stain they always seal the wood

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.319 
apply a stain they always seal the wood
and<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.800> reason<00:01:01.070> why<00:01:01.160> they<00:01:01.340> seal<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.910> wood<00:01:02.090> or

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and the reason why they seal the wood or

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.299 
and the reason why they seal the wood or
the<00:01:02.360> pores<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.960> wood<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.530> because<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.189> you

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the pores of the wood is because if you

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.980 
the pores of the wood is because if you
don't<00:01:04.549> you're<00:01:05.089> gonna<00:01:05.180> get<00:01:05.390> blotchiness

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
don't you're gonna get blotchiness

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.590 
don't you're gonna get blotchiness
because<00:01:06.439> depending<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.340> different<00:01:07.820> parts<00:01:08.270> of

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
because depending on different parts of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.450 
because depending on different parts of
the<00:01:08.869> wood<00:01:09.079> you're<00:01:09.470> gonna<00:01:09.619> have<00:01:09.829> some<00:01:10.070> areas

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
the wood you're gonna have some areas

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.490 
the wood you're gonna have some areas
that<00:01:10.670> are<00:01:10.820> more<00:01:10.970> porous<00:01:11.390> than<00:01:11.420> others<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
that are more porous than others the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.020 
that are more porous than others the
more<00:01:12.740> porous<00:01:13.159> areas<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:13.610> going<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.790> collect

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
more porous areas are going to collect

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.149 
more porous areas are going to collect
more<00:01:14.299> stain<00:01:14.630> become<00:01:15.110> darker<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.950> more

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
more stain become darker and the more

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.640 
more stain become darker and the more
dense<00:01:16.430> areas<00:01:16.850> will<00:01:17.030> become<00:01:17.149> lighter<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.409> if

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
dense areas will become lighter so if

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.440 
dense areas will become lighter so if
you're<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.010> do<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> fine<00:01:19.460> finish<00:01:19.909> all

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
you're going to do a fine finish all

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.830 
you're going to do a fine finish all
finishers<00:01:21.640> will<00:01:22.640> take<00:01:22.909> its<00:01:23.150> seal<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.570> pores

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
finishers will take its seal the pores

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.080 
finishers will take its seal the pores
of<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> wood<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.890> beauty<00:01:25.220> about<00:01:25.310> resin<00:01:25.880> it's

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
of the wood the beauty about resin it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.320 
of the wood the beauty about resin it's
a<00:01:26.240> non<00:01:26.479> porous<00:01:27.110> material<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.610> don't<00:01:28.820> have<00:01:29.120> to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
a non porous material you don't have to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.830 
a non porous material you don't have to
do<00:01:29.450> that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
do that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.020 
do that
we<00:01:30.260> primer<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.890> material<00:01:31.340> because<00:01:31.850> what

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
we primer the material because what

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.760 
we primer the material because what
we're<00:01:32.180> trying<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.540> do<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:32.960> get<00:01:33.140> an<00:01:33.260> even<00:01:33.590> base

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
we're trying to do is get an even base

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.120 
we're trying to do is get an even base
coat<00:01:34.330> between<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.570> resin<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.530> wood<00:01:36.740> so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
coat between the resin and the wood so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.280 
coat between the resin and the wood so
that<00:01:37.159> when<00:01:37.370> you<00:01:37.460> apply<00:01:37.640> your<00:01:37.909> stain<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.080> have

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
that when you apply your stain you have

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.130 
that when you apply your stain you have
a<00:01:39.320> perfect<00:01:39.950> blend<00:01:40.159> now<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:41.330> we've<00:01:41.479> done<00:01:41.510> here

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
a perfect blend now what we've done here

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.310 
a perfect blend now what we've done here
is<00:01:42.350> we've<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:42.710> applied<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.869> pale<00:01:44.869> yellow

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
is we've just applied the pale yellow

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.899 
is we've just applied the pale yellow
because<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> code<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.490> we're<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.820> be

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
because the code that we're going to be

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.580 
because the code that we're going to be
staying<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:47.330> called<00:01:47.570> our<00:01:47.690> Coco<00:01:48.049> berry<00:01:48.290> and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
staying is called our Coco berry and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.910 
staying is called our Coco berry and
that's<00:01:49.490> going<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.760> be<00:01:49.909> step<00:01:50.479> number<00:01:50.690> four<00:01:51.200> now

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
that's going to be step number four now

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.490 
that's going to be step number four now
after<00:01:52.909> we've<00:01:53.090> primed<00:01:53.479> we're<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.260> do<00:01:54.380> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
after we've primed we're going to do the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.050 
after we've primed we're going to do the
same<00:01:54.740> thing<00:01:55.070> we're<00:01:55.460> going<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.640> take<00:01:55.880> all<00:01:56.030> of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
same thing we're going to take all of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.390 
same thing we're going to take all of
our<00:01:56.240> sand<00:01:56.570> papers<00:01:57.020> or<00:01:57.229> our<00:01:57.320> standing<00:01:57.860> pads<00:01:58.100> or

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
our sand papers or our standing pads or

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760 
our sand papers or our standing pads or
green<00:01:58.790> pads<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.360> we're<00:01:59.930> going<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.080> sand<00:02:00.530> all

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
green pads and we're going to sand all

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.740 
green pads and we're going to sand all
the<00:02:00.799> material<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.549> get<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.880> ready<00:02:02.180> for<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the material and get it ready for the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.140 
the material and get it ready for the
staining<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.350> glazing<00:02:03.799> all<00:02:04.220> we<00:02:04.520> try<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.790> do<00:02:05.030> in

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
staining and glazing all we try to do in

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.640 
staining and glazing all we try to do in
this<00:02:05.299> step<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.780> explain<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
this step is to explain to you the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.589 
this step is to explain to you the
