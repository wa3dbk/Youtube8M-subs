00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 moin moin welcome to another 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 video of me today I show it like that 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.519
 probably already should see that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.800
 minecraft web interface the bed eins.de 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.960
 There is also called multi-power 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.269
 well which features had that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.870
 webinterface exactly you have a live 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 console 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.730
 you can find them over there you can 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 for example, in ingame commands enter 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 it is not possible at the moment, but it still works 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 offline is you have an ingame chat 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.710
 You can do that with your players 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 chat and here you can still see 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 which players are connected 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.630
 then but as I said is offline 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.780
 you can not play a player here either 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 see here you can play 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.010
 working here could be very different 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 Edit confixx 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 Of course, there is no computer yet 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.460
 that's why you can not edit any 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.870
 as the next option point you have 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.579
 Here is the poster option 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 to install 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.110
 to test we install the plug-in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.899
 Give wild card here is a vodka 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.879
 press on it a third time 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 install and then that should be 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 of course, be installed there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 Of course I wanted to take bread too 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.330
 we still do that and press here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 also install on 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.130
 let's go back and then they are 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.500
 planner is of course installed as 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.870
 further point you still have that the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.510
 possibility of a ftp access to the server 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.050
 to get there you go to fdp access 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.580
 you see your horst-peter needs yours 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.930
 portals fdp usernames very important 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.920
 is that after that there is still a point 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.170
 so that a high number and you need 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.490
 for multi cam was so very with the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 multi log in 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.960
 another nice feature is her 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 you can create china backups 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.470
 For that, you just have to like 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.290
 also press states and should 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.200
 wanted to start a backup Mr 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 was created and then we can do something 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310
 go back to backups and go back 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.929
 then you can restore to here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.930
 go and here we see that works like that 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 the last point we have here 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.830
 the possibility of other users 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.220
 Access rights are given by either fdp 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.810
 or for the whole server and as 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.820
 You can still go last but not least 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.240
 task plan so different keys 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.140
 do 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.820
 for example you can get one here 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 certain time will be determined 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.200
 always execute a command like that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.290
 for example c and a few meters to 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.090
 the halo for yes what is 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.860
 actually already for a small video 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 More questions are open you can do it 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.430
