00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
different kinds of gold scrap this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.229 
different kinds of gold scrap this
particular<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.559> has<00:00:52.829> high<00:00:53.129> current<00:00:53.610> bus<00:00:53.940> bar

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
particular one has high current bus bar

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.840

sink<00:01:00.180> latches<00:01:01.219> this<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.789> actually<00:01:03.090> has

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
sink latches this one here actually has

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.300 
sink latches this one here actually has
precision<00:01:04.439> machined<00:01:05.720> gold-plated<00:01:06.720> parts

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
precision machined gold-plated parts

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
precision machined gold-plated parts
it's<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.909> normal<00:01:09.090> gold<00:01:09.570> plating<00:01:10.080> it's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it's not your normal gold plating it's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's not your normal gold plating it's
actually<00:01:10.740> double<00:01:11.159> thickness<00:01:11.659> military-grade

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
actually double thickness military-grade

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.320 
actually double thickness military-grade
plating<00:01:13.650> which<00:01:13.830> makes<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.430> very<00:01:14.490> close<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
plating which makes it very close to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.700 
plating which makes it very close to
what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.750> call<00:01:16.020> gold<00:01:16.320> fills<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> got

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
what you would call gold fills you got

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
what you would call gold fills you got
these<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.869> very

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
these little things here that are very

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.149 
these little things here that are very
nice<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:23.750> nicely<00:01:24.750> gold-plated<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.950> also

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
nice very nicely gold-plated you also

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.270 
nice very nicely gold-plated you also
got<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> indium<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.280> we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
got a little bit of indium in them we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.390 
got a little bit of indium in them we
had<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:30.210> things<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.400> actually

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
had these things which are actually

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
had these things which are actually
useful<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:33.229> project<00:01:34.229> cases<00:01:34.710> you've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
useful for project cases you've got a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.850 
useful for project cases you've got a
nice<00:01:35.390> thermal<00:01:36.390> electrical<00:01:36.990> cooling<00:01:37.500> device

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
nice thermal electrical cooling device

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.960 
nice thermal electrical cooling device
and<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.960> look<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> thickness<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and you look at the thickness of this I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
and you look at the thickness of this I
mean<00:01:42.119> look<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.570> badly<00:01:42.840> dented<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
mean look at how badly dented it is and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.520 
mean look at how badly dented it is and
still<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> gold<00:01:45.149> plating<00:01:45.840> remains<00:01:46.170> intact

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
still the gold plating remains intact

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
still the gold plating remains intact
definitely<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.390> lots<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.600> gold<00:01:51.810> scrap

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
definitely good for lots of gold scrap

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.670 
definitely good for lots of gold scrap
you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.640> another<00:01:54.200> gold<00:01:55.200> plated

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you can see here another gold plated

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.450 
you can see here another gold plated
thing<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.850> yet<00:01:57.060> another<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.899> still<00:01:58.200> another
