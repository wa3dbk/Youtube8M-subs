you

now foreplay here we got dunked into

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.869 
now foreplay here we got dunked into
that's<00:03:25.860> gonna<00:03:26.010> be<00:03:26.189> interesting

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
that's gonna be interesting

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.059 
that's gonna be interesting
somebody<00:03:27.269> dogs<00:03:27.569> into<00:03:27.930> us<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.260> think<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.799> this

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
somebody dogs into us I think that this

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.520 
somebody dogs into us I think that this
is<00:03:29.250> either<00:03:29.489> gonna<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> draw<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.780> medium

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
is either gonna be a draw a medium

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.300 
is either gonna be a draw a medium
strength<00:03:31.829> hand<00:03:32.189> like<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> medium<00:03:33.030> ace<00:03:33.209> or<00:03:34.310> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
strength hand like a medium ace or a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.729 
strength hand like a medium ace or a
bottom<00:03:36.000> pair<00:03:36.209> type<00:03:36.420> hand<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:37.110> mid<00:03:37.319> pair<00:03:37.530> type

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
bottom pair type hand a mid pair type

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.380 
bottom pair type hand a mid pair type
hand<00:03:38.010> like<00:03:38.159> pocket<00:03:38.519> fives<00:03:38.760> or<00:03:39.030> stuff<00:03:39.299> like

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
hand like pocket fives or stuff like

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.710 
hand like pocket fives or stuff like
that

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.229 
that
I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.799> our<00:03:41.040> hand<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.400> definitely<00:03:41.970> strong

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
I think our hand is definitely strong

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.729 
I think our hand is definitely strong
enough<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.540> continue<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.260> also<00:03:43.470> gonna

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
enough to continue and it's also gonna

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.319 
enough to continue and it's also gonna
be<00:03:43.859> strong<00:03:44.099> enough<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.430> continue<00:03:44.670> on<00:03:44.939> the<00:03:45.090> turn

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
be strong enough to continue on the turn

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.690 
be strong enough to continue on the turn
it's<00:03:46.319> gonna<00:03:46.439> be<00:03:46.620> interesting<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.250> see<00:03:47.430> what<00:03:47.609> he

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
it's gonna be interesting to see what he

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's gonna be interesting to see what he
does<00:03:47.819> on<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.030> river<00:03:48.299> because<00:03:48.689> if<00:03:48.780> he<00:03:48.840> bets<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
does on the river because if he bets the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.619 
does on the river because if he bets the
river<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:49.890> we<00:03:50.069> have<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> pretty<00:03:50.760> easy<00:03:50.970> fold

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
river I think we have a pretty easy fold

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.220 
river I think we have a pretty easy fold
or<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.470> check<00:03:53.010> behind<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.640> played<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:54.239> yeah<00:03:55.049> he

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
or a check behind as played and yeah he

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.899 
or a check behind as played and yeah he
had<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.349> medium<00:03:55.799> pair<00:03:56.069> he<00:03:56.340> had<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> pair<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.819> a

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
had a medium pair he had a pair of a

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.240 
had a medium pair he had a pair of a
pair<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.389> jacks<00:03:57.690> which<00:03:58.079> is<00:03:58.260> quite

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
pair of jacks which is quite

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.830 
pair of jacks which is quite
unconventional<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.180> him<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.569> playing

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
unconventional for him to be playing

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.300 
unconventional for him to be playing
that<00:04:01.019> way<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.540> player<00:04:03.720> dunks<00:04:04.409> it<00:04:04.650> usually

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
that way so if a player dunks it usually

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.640 
that way so if a player dunks it usually
means<00:04:05.489> he<00:04:05.760> has<00:04:05.940> either<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.450> weak<00:04:06.810> made<00:04:07.079> hand<00:04:07.409> or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
means he has either a weak made hand or

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.460 
means he has either a weak made hand or
a<00:04:07.709> draw<00:04:08.250> with<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.450> mind<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:10.109> could<00:04:10.319> try

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a draw with that in mind you could try

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.619 
a draw with that in mind you could try
to<00:04:10.530> mix<00:04:10.859> your<00:04:10.980> game<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.579> call<00:04:12.150> with<00:04:12.389> hands

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
to mix your game up and call with hands

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.839 
to mix your game up and call with hands
if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.959> would<00:04:13.079> usually<00:04:13.470> fold<00:04:13.799> or<00:04:14.370> even<00:04:14.579> try<00:04:14.790> to

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
if you would usually fold or even try to

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:23.250 
if you would usually fold or even try to
raise

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:32.630 

you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.100 

here<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.000> table<00:04:34.630> I'm<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.900> I'm<00:04:35.080> just

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
here on the table I'm just I'm just

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.160 
here on the table I'm just I'm just
calling<00:04:35.530> because<00:04:35.650> he<00:04:35.980> bet<00:04:36.130> very<00:04:36.280> small<00:04:36.670> and

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
calling because he bet very small and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.750 
calling because he bet very small and
we've<00:04:38.170> got<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.680> was<00:04:38.890> in<00:04:38.980> fact<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.280> flush<00:04:39.520> draw

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
we've got so I was in fact a flush draw

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.580 
we've got so I was in fact a flush draw
which<00:04:40.180> again<00:04:40.600> doesn't<00:04:41.080> seem<00:04:41.260> like<00:04:41.380> much<00:04:41.530> but

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
which again doesn't seem like much but
does<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.490> curry

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
does that so a curry

does that so a curry
here<00:04:45.610> we<00:04:45.730> turn<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:45.940> king<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.420> we're<00:04:46.510> gonna

here we turn a king and we're gonna

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.540 
here we turn a king and we're gonna
proceed<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.170> old<00:04:47.410> as<00:04:47.920> though<00:04:48.160> we<00:04:48.310> have<00:04:48.430> the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
proceed of the old as though we have the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.170 
proceed of the old as though we have the
nuts<00:04:49.170> if<00:04:50.170> we<00:04:50.740> get<00:04:50.890> check<00:04:51.160> raised<00:04:51.430> we're<00:04:52.060> gonna

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
nuts if we get check raised we're gonna

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.010 
nuts if we get check raised we're gonna
go<00:04:52.390> with<00:04:52.600> it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
go with it

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.930 
go with it
we<00:04:53.290> probably<00:04:53.470> wouldn't<00:04:53.740> be<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:54.160> ecstatic

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
we probably wouldn't be that ecstatic

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.360 
we probably wouldn't be that ecstatic
because<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:55.900> it's<00:04:56.170> possible<00:04:57.010> he<00:04:57.220> had<00:04:57.340> a

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
because you know it's possible he had a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.500 
because you know it's possible he had a
good<00:04:57.580> hand<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.880> flop<00:04:57.940> we<00:04:58.300> don't<00:04:58.420> really

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
good hand on the flop we don't really

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.450 
good hand on the flop we don't really
know<00:04:58.660> how<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.840> plays<00:04:59.110> but<00:04:59.860> we're<00:05:00.130> we're<00:05:00.430> pretty

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
know how it plays but we're we're pretty

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.550 
know how it plays but we're we're pretty
confident<00:05:01.120> at<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.300> stage<00:05:04.140> here<00:05:05.140> it<00:05:05.440> would

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
confident at this stage here it would

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.200 
confident at this stage here it would
have<00:05:05.650> been<00:05:05.740> extremely<00:05:05.860> loose<00:05:06.580> for<00:05:06.820> him<00:05:07.000> to

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
have been extremely loose for him to

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.840 
have been extremely loose for him to
have<00:05:07.560> check<00:05:08.560> hold<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:08.920> tongue<00:05:09.160> with<00:05:09.340> ten<00:05:09.610> nine

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
have check hold the tongue with ten nine

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.460 
have check hold the tongue with ten nine
which<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.300> obviously<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.870> obvious<00:05:11.140> hand<00:05:11.350> that

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
which is obviously the obvious hand that

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.810 
which is obviously the obvious hand that
got<00:05:11.620> there<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.070> here<00:05:12.280> we're<00:05:12.400> gonna<00:05:12.490> value

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
got there and here we're gonna value

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.670 
got there and here we're gonna value
race

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
race

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.010 
race
so<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.950> make<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.250> huge<00:05:15.790> but<00:05:16.510> we<00:05:16.900> want

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so I have to make this huge but we want

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.970 
so I have to make this huge but we want
to<00:05:17.080> make<00:05:17.170> it<00:05:17.260> big<00:05:17.380> enough<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.680> make<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:17.860> look

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
to make it big enough to make it look

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.010 
to make it big enough to make it look
like<00:05:18.160> we<00:05:18.280> could<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.490> bluffing<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.420> he<00:05:19.720> very

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
like we could be bluffing and he very

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.410 
like we could be bluffing and he very
likely<00:05:20.110> has<00:05:20.470> a<00:05:20.500> hand<00:05:20.800> like<00:05:21.010> a<00:05:21.040> jack<00:05:21.370> or<00:05:21.670> even<00:05:22.390> a

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420

likely has a hand like a jack or even a
hand<00:05:22.600> like<00:05:22.720> eight<00:05:22.870> nine<00:05:22.900> he's<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.530> trying<00:05:23.710> to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
hand like eight nine he's just trying to

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.770 
hand like eight nine he's just trying to

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
put in a blocking bet I'd be a fairly

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.580 
put in a blocking bet I'd be a fairly
sophisticated<00:05:25.960> play<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:27.040> bet<00:05:27.400> three<00:05:27.970> bet<00:05:28.210> here

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
sophisticated play to bet three bet here

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.690 
sophisticated play to bet three bet here
although<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.740> know<00:05:29.890> not<00:05:30.070> necessarily<00:05:30.610> it's
