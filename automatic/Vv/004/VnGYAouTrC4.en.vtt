 You really find irritation a bit 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.790
 who gets pieces when the vegetables are ready 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.520

 and all labels 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.120
 if the rice is correct then the fire can go out 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.500

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.500
