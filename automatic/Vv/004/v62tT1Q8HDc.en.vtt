right off of the cable needle
which<00:02:07.929> is<00:02:08.079> what<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.259> usually<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.829> when<00:02:09.009> I'm

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.819 
using a double pointed needle but I have
this<00:02:11.579> goofy<00:02:12.989> cable<00:02:13.989> needle<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.709> I'm

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
this goofy cable needle here so I'm

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.130 
this goofy cable needle here so I'm
going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.099> put<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.549> back<00:02:16.239> on<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.750> my<00:02:16.870> left

going to put them back on to my left

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.000 
going to put them back on to my left
needle<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.180> easier<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.870> knit<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:23.010> so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
needle so it's easier to knit them so

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.160 
needle so it's easier to knit them so
I'm<00:02:24.099> getting<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.610> three<00:02:25.000> stitches<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:26.019> were

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
stitches onto my cable needle hold them

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.930
