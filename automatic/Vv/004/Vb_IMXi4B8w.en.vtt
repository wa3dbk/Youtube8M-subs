00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
trying to get it to move we do not want

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
trying to get it to move we do not want
it<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> die<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> guys<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it to die out and as you guys can see it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
it to die out and as you guys can see it
slowly<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> die<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
slowly about to die out and you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
slowly about to die out and you know
when<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.799> blinking<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> drops<00:01:24.210> down

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
when it's blinking but it drops down

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
when it's blinking but it drops down
just<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:25.229> gets<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.340> teams<00:01:26.790> or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
just in time gets the other teams or

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.819 
just in time gets the other teams or
guess<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> other<00:01:27.810> train<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
guess the other train and it's going to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.240 
guess the other train and it's going to
hit<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.250> second<00:01:29.759> actual<00:01:30.420> lum<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.040> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
hit this second actual lum thing so as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
hit this second actual lum thing so as
you<00:01:32.430> guys<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> hit<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you guys can see it's going to hit a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
you guys can see it's going to hit a
writer<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.979> champs<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.490> actually

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
writer out here so champs is actually

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
writer out here so champs is actually
going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> throw<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.450> his<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:37.200> bomb

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
going to throw down his little time bomb

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.190 
going to throw down his little time bomb
and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.369> we're<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.750> simple<00:01:40.110> as

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and then we're going to go so simple as

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
and then we're going to go so simple as
that<00:01:40.229> guys<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.220> whisk<00:01:41.549> done

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that guys we got the first whisk done

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.929 
that guys we got the first whisk done
simple<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.229> hard<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
simple as that it's not that hard and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.010 
simple as that it's not that hard and
pretty<00:01:44.939> much<00:01:45.030> we're<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> revert<00:01:45.960> back

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pretty much we're going to revert back

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
pretty much we're going to revert back
into<00:01:46.439> time<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.880> repeat

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
into time now and we're going to repeat

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
into time now and we're going to repeat
the<00:01:48.420> process<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> second<00:01:50.130> one

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the process and do with the second one

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
the process and do with the second one
we're<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> same<00:01:51.720> exact

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
we're just going to do the same exact

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
we're just going to do the same exact
thing<00:01:52.470> again<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.130> simple<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.180> just

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
thing again it's simple as that you just

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
thing again it's simple as that you just
do<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> twice<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> actually

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
do it twice and you're going to actually

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
do it twice and you're going to actually
repeat<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> same<00:01:57.719> process<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.320> pretty<00:01:58.560> much

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
repeat the same process so pretty much

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.499 
repeat the same process so pretty much
you<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> same<00:01:59.159> exact<00:01:59.549> thing<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.180> bring<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you do the same exact thing you bring it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
you do the same exact thing you bring it
over<00:02:00.780> again<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.200> bring<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:01.890> up

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
over again you bring it all the way up

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
over again you bring it all the way up
you<00:02:02.219> jump<00:02:02.490> across<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.210> around<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you jump across you go around here you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.690 
you jump across you go around here you
bring<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> zombies<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
bring it down and get the zombies you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
bring it down and get the zombies you
get<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.990> move<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> way<00:02:07.530> again

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
get it back up we move all the way again

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
get it back up we move all the way again
and<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.550> light<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:08.970> second

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and it's going to light up the second

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.110 
and it's going to light up the second
orb<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.099> guys<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.370> see<00:02:11.430> here

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
orb so now we as you guys can see here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
orb so now we as you guys can see here
we<00:02:12.270> are<00:02:12.420> we're<00:02:12.750> doing<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> again<00:02:13.349> get

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
we are we're doing it again get

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
we are we're doing it again get
the<00:02:13.920> second<00:02:14.220> door<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.490> all<00:02:14.670> follow<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.270> keep

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the second door we all follow it to keep

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420 
the second door we all follow it to keep
the<00:02:15.660> energy<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> light

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the energy there and it's going to light

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.250 
the energy there and it's going to light
up<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.670> second<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.390> then<00:02:18.600> now<00:02:18.870> you're<00:02:19.080> on

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
up the second one and then now you're on

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.960 
up the second one and then now you're on
to<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> next<00:02:19.860> step<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.670> hope<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.880> guys
