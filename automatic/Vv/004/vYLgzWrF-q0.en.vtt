 i'm coming to stuttgart and mine 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.179
 Boys always say when they see me in Cologne

 things suits staple jacket 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.730
 sacco so everything that beats something 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.140
 there are no future trends for me 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.969
 For me, there is only the classic like 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 they like to enter suit us 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.329
 have revolutionized the suit 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.219
 tight-cut tight pants go the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.649
 So every day there is a new suit 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:07.130
 has been in the 1950's in 2000's 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.930
 Also in 2050 and so his suit is 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.030
 After all, fairtrade is of course very 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.970
 so important in general as in all 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.470
 industry is important that things are the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.560
 are produced under fair 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 conditions are produced and me 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.170
 believe it will be here in james 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.810
 especially I have a new one 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.490
 music project a swing music 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.340
 crossover with pop music with two others 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.170
 very wonderful singers winters band 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 and that's pretty big for the next one 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.730
 projects 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 we're a bit like that 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.880
 I want to be clear and be 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.200
 rapid star tv so i believe that 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.320
 most important my love is actually 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.210
 Trust and honesty is mine too 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 so important and what do you say 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.850
 I think that's what love is 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.590
 sarah says the most important thing and what 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.280
 maybe not believe but dispute is 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.560
 Also important to be back afterwards 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.960
 in the arms and reconcile a course 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 give everything nice because you say so too 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.350
 always that if you look at yourself when you are 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.820
 argue and then you lie yes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.260
 also right because otherwise it works if you 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.220
 does not love then there's nothing 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.010
 what the other one 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.420
 then bother and write on everyone 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:32.400
 enough to say case to which we can 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.630

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.060
 So yes, I would definitely say 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.460
 Do not lose yourself in the courage 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.710

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.250
 believe in yourself that is whole 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.250
 important 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.200

 years old come from cologne and if you 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.500
 on the couch unit and you have 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.450

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.370
 especially happy because the boys me 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.300
 talk between as if I myself fashion 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.920
 it would not have to work 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.410
 standard totally freaky day 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120

 so on the street anti can be a good one 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.460
 combination of passion 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:39.870
 the frames insight 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:41.780
 this is definitely one of the biggest 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.370
 Cities in Germany where you really 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.590
 Fashion can find the best fashion 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.990
 at all here you are also in the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.510
 west address jades is known everywhere 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.030
 Everyone knows what that means 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.220
 and therefore so if you are in düsseldorf 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.960
 then comes dutiful program here 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.000
 need to 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.580
 So I'm one of those in my everyday life 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.990
 happy then so high and the short and 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.300
 Wedges cope 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.800
 that's nice and easy today of course 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.400
 I'm so pretty 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.370
 So I made the chance I like 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.010
 This combination is chic and normal 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.050
 so it's not so much 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.030
 Exaggerated so you should always 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.530
 look a bit but find us 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.009
 that you do not either automatically or 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.229
 is too little 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.270
 that's a good question what really for 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.229
 fashion makes everything in any case 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.349
 which is colorful 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.360
 but I find that a book is something of a fashion 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:38.289
 it must have to say yes and 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.539
 because I love prince and colors 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.819
 In any case, for me it always has to be colorful 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.639
 be and have a message with me 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.559
