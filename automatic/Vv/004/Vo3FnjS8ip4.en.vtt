00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.900
 in this video I will share with 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.740
 you my recreation of one of the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.680
 kim kardashian looks this will be a 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.570
 dramatic but super stylish makeup 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 where we're going to play alone with the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.609
 natural colors we begin 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.160
 The first thing we are going to do is apply 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.740
 farmar in our eyelids and then a 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.599
 cream-colored shade with a brown cited 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 clarito let's draw in our 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.070
 eyelids pretty much a way to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 almond we blur this very well and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.839
 we add depth with a brown more 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.699
 dark I will add a shadow with glitter 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.920
 in my lacrimal and bone my 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.430
 eyebrows blurs everything very well and we think 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.950
 in the next step 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.050
 I'm going to apply a frame in the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.270
 face to disappear the pores and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.900
 now I'm going to apply a base but that 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.250
 be a full coverage I was a 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.260
 little miss your face but at 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.850
 blur it well and after all 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.040
 correctors and shadows will remain 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.229
 perfect we will add a corrector 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.690
 clarito under our eyes doing 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.119
 this triangle shape and we're going to 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.080
 blur it super super good because no 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.150
 we want to look like raccoons or that like the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.369
 Kim Kardashian's makeup is based 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 in the lights we are going to add after 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.840
 that we blur the corrector well 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.479
 Illuminator beneath our eyes 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.670
 in this way in the story of our 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.560
 nose on our forehead in our 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.110
 lips and sides and also in the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.500
 chin a lot of light but all blurred 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.119
 it will look good and you will see how besides 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.310
 based on the lights is based on the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.190
 shadows we are going to need a base more 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.640
 dark the tone of your skin and we're going to 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.310
 apply below our cheeks 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 that the cheekbones and our 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.200
 face look finite also in 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.360
 our forehead and also down to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.119
 define the contour of our face 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.190
 you can also apply it on your nose if 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.800
 you need it to make it look like 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.899
 you have the perfect nose we're going to 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.230
 blur everything very well with a brush 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.690
 of open bristles this is going to give us the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.360
 effect as if we did the makeup 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.180
 with airbrush 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.850
 then we already have the basics that are 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 the shadows and illuminated correctors 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.320
 and all that has blurred we do not want that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.380
 no line looks super marked 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.330
 after we do all this we are going to 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.300
 preserve our eyebrows because Kim 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.540
 kardashian has eyebrows filled and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.980
 defined I am already using my product 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.440
 favorite that is called 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.420
 brown or I'm going to leave all 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.990
 details of my products in the box 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.820
 of information we will seal everything giving 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.400
 the touches landmarks with a loose dust I 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.470
 I'm using the banana powder and we're going to 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 apply bronzer where we apply the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.250
 shadows previously 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.049
 we add life to our face with 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.599
 blush from our apples 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.940
 blurring it towards the line of our 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.130
 hair 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.590
 Kim Kardashian can not live without this 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.170
 illuminating powder over one we explain the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.500
 blush earlier this gives you a look 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.420
 as well as tan illuminated also in 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.240
 the bridge of our nose if on top of 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.670
 our lips in line of my eyes with 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.410
 liquid eyeliner to prepare them for 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.240
 the false eyelashes because Kim 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.640
 kardashian is also characterized by 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.350
 his huge eyelashes in the line of 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.570
 our lower lashes do not apply 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.400
 brown shadow and we're also going to apply 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.610
 a lot of mascara 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.319
 the mascara will make your eyes look super 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.900
 open and have that look 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.000
 feminine as the one from whom we apply 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 liquid eyeliner after it 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.980
 has dried our glue and in our 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.710
 lips as always a skin color with 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.330
 eyeliner and then with a 2 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.490
 I'm going to retouch what I applied 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.600
 previously in my eyes just to 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.850
 make sure that is what 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.880
 sufficiently bright and diffused 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.100
 then we're ready girls what 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.130
 we made a makeup similar to Kim's 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.510
 kardashian so I forget the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.580
 same brush with which you apply the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.380
 corrector let's give it a little 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.380
 product below bronzer 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.200
