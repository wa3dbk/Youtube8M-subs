00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.080
 increase in the selection of this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.909
 problem had a goal as per 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 example going live for the first time 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.319
 lives alone is working outside the country 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.110
 you already have a national experience in 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.520
 my resume also wanted very much 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.020
 improve my level of English and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 know to say that I did not know 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.869
 I can still say without a shadow of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.880
 doubt that the program met 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.810
 absolutely everything I expected from him 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.250
 and much more 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.630
 That's why today for everyone who 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.790
 I know in person that you 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 ask how much it was recommended 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.170
 to do this program because it is the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 cheaper you undoubtedly get a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 exchange and a different from work 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.170
 abroad at the same time as you are 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 thirst is a bit of stuff 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 incredible that happen in a sun program 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.719
 internet in which he and he himself 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.759
 usually lasts between mid-November 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.950
 and mid-January depending on where 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.019
 is Brazil and more generally are 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 these two weeks between November and 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.859
 January the registrations take place every 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.530
 years they start in April 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.660
 and May and the first interview for lack 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.579
 June / July reach takes every year 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.480
 for the United States about 200 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.070
 Brazilians 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.670
 so it may even look like a number 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.740
 great 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.510
 but the competition is absurdly larger 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.400
 is that several people who really went 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 one of the spirits is very big then 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.580
 It's not that easy. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.410
 according to the directors for him the problem 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 here below the video I'll put the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.280

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.630
 skin for who is going to this program 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.400
 The first is to be at least 18 years old 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.980
 age to be a student of a course 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.080

 from intermediate to advanced 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.150
 dispute when speaking and having money 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.489
 enough to pay for the courses as 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.260
 cost as the cost drops for interview 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.209
 cost of airfare mc guru 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.100
 United States road 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.260
 Like I said, you need to go to a 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.390
 of these first lectures and interviews 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.310
 usually this is how it happens in 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.650
 paulo and rio de janeiro beautiful horizon 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.359
 Fortress but every year it changes 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.230
 always completely at least they are 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.700
 paulo and the river 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.440
 but he already went to several others 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.299
 states of Brazil depends on the demand 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.130
 people in those states who are 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.660
 the year I made the selection 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.430
 for example I did all my 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.200
 interviews on reef so I thought 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.850
 and that there was very quiet and now I 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.530
 talk a little about how I work in the 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.900
 list of which functions you have 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 can receive several I think are more or 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.769
 less 11 12 to 15 different functions you 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.450
 can exercise in the diju 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.130
 but how many are I going to talk about? 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.329

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790
 what would be your job when 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.100
 there came the first bike that ratings 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.570
 it is the function it exercised 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.450
 that is the person who works from 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.230
 of the parks shows is that person 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.850
 what do you see when you arrive at a 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.740
 little one who 's in there working 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.450
 there are also the costs that are very 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.160
 who are responsible for the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.990
 maintenance of park areas and 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.420
 hotels are responsible for both 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.040
 cleaning when talking to the software 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.260
 to talk to park visitors 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.180
 and answer all the doubts there in the middle 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.900

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.700

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.470
 If you like this thing do not stay in the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.330

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.320
 A lot of people here in Brazil

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.600
 quick retention 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.460
 another very desired load function 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.080
 that meets this is the person who stays there 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.260

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.920
 in the chat he always takes care of the 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.210
 character in the bar talks to 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.750
 children and visitors to the 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.640
 park 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.350
 Another function that many people are to 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.270
 the same faces of merchandising this 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.670
 person who will be in disney stores 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.680

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.440
 he can pick up several drives and 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.760
 inventory until you get cash or 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.350
 stay by the store helping people 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.120
 are wanting to buy something from 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.100
 position for those who did not have the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.500
 potential and wants to work in an environment 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.150
 very dynamic sales and such is 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.550
 suffering are some of the main 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.020
 drugs but there are several that exist but 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.520
 important to note that the tip is who 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.080
 choose which position you are going to 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.880
 work the pact but do not worry 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.710
 because they always ask what they are 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.050
 your preferences granted up to 3 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.950
 preferences and they will try to see which 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.510
 is your favorite 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.160
 within what you really are 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.230
 wishing but the final decision of what 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.580
 Are you really going to do what? 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.800
 Are you going to work, are you going to work? 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.050
 even the motel is always gives the hint you can 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.820
 to be a character for example I read that 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.440
 buzz lightyear but it depends on the 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.600
 their characteristics as for example 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.340

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.170
 theater and has the right time to 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.150
 hair of the character in the 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.460
 first lecture he always explains 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.020
 each of the positions well given 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.670
 so you have enough time to 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.500
 choose what your order is 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.270
 preference and where would you like more 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.920

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.420
