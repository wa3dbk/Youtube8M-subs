00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
but what is consistent is this idea that

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.959 
but what is consistent is this idea that
they<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.129> there<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.430> something

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
different about him just inherently

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.839 
different about him just inherently
they're<00:03:12.180> aware<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.689> and<00:03:12.859> they<00:03:13.859> all<00:03:14.430> feel

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
they're aware of it and they all feel

they're aware of it and they all feel
that<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.359> is<00:03:15.389> something<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:16.079> they<00:03:16.319> need<00:03:16.530> to

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
that it is something that they need to

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.080 
that it is something that they need to
destroy<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.879> will<00:03:18.449> have<00:03:18.689> flesh<00:03:19.669> then<00:03:20.669> I<00:03:20.819> will

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
destroy I will have flesh then I will

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.569 
destroy I will have flesh then I will
have<00:03:21.299> all<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.049> he<00:03:22.680> was<00:03:22.829> clearly<00:03:23.189> very

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
have all of it he was clearly very

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.550 
have all of it he was clearly very
intelligent<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.449> he<00:03:24.510> recognized<00:03:25.169> very

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
intelligent and he recognized very

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.189 
intelligent and he recognized very
quickly<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.219> his<00:03:26.459> life<00:03:27.180> could<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.930> snatched

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
quickly that his life could be snatched

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.580 
quickly that his life could be snatched
away<00:03:28.379> from<00:03:28.590> him<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.889> any<00:03:29.579> given<00:03:29.909> day<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.290> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
away from him on any given day and so I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.589 
away from him on any given day and so I
think<00:03:32.040> he<00:03:32.459> felt<00:03:32.699> like<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.030> strongest<00:03:33.419> thing

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
think he felt like the strongest thing

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.720 
think he felt like the strongest thing
he<00:03:33.689> could<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:33.959> was<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.139> stay<00:03:34.469> alive<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:35.609> that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
he could do was to stay alive and that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.429 
he could do was to stay alive and that
if<00:03:35.819> he<00:03:35.879> stayed<00:03:36.120> alive<00:03:36.329> long<00:03:36.629> enough<00:03:36.659> perhaps

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
if he stayed alive long enough perhaps

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
if he stayed alive long enough perhaps
he<00:03:38.189> would<00:03:38.430> find<00:03:39.000> his<00:03:39.209> way<00:03:39.419> out

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
he would find his way out

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.920 
he would find his way out
so<00:03:41.459> Ayman<00:03:41.699> realized<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.510> know<00:03:42.599> there's

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
so Ayman realized that you know there's

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.449 
so Ayman realized that you know there's
a<00:03:42.959> possibility<00:03:43.169> of<00:03:43.590> him<00:03:43.889> seeing<00:03:44.189> his<00:03:44.280> family

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
a possibility of him seeing his family

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.640 
a possibility of him seeing his family
