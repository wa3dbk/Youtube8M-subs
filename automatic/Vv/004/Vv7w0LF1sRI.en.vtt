look at but the two codes I'm getting is

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.199 
look at but the two codes I'm getting is
a<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.390> P<00:02:25.040> 1538<00:02:26.040> fuel<00:02:26.819> cutoff

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
a I think it's a P 1538 fuel cutoff

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
a I think it's a P 1538 fuel cutoff
valve<00:02:28.400> open<00:02:29.400> circuit<00:02:29.819> or<00:02:29.970> ground

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
valve open circuit or ground

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.809 
valve open circuit or ground
intermittent<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:34.620> understand<00:02:34.980> is

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
intermittent and this one understand is

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.400 
intermittent and this one understand is
the<00:02:36.690> fuel<00:02:36.900> cutoff<00:02:37.170> valve<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the fuel cutoff valve and that is the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.350 
the fuel cutoff valve and that is the
ground<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.890> goes<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> I've<00:02:41.459> made<00:02:42.060> sure

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
ground that goes to it I've made sure

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.160 
ground that goes to it I've made sure
that<00:02:42.569> ground<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:44.310> wire<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.750> nut<00:02:45.930> is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that ground or that wire and the nut is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.610 
that ground or that wire and the nut is
tight<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.680> actually<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.250> put<00:02:47.550> some

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
tight I actually just put some

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.479 
tight I actually just put some
dielectric<00:02:49.620> grease<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.340> make

does anybody know health and those

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.590 
does anybody know health and those
things<00:02:53.519> go<00:02:54.239> out<00:02:54.450> not<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.440> pump<00:02:55.620> itself<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
things go out not to pump itself but the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.690 
things go out not to pump itself but the
fuel<00:02:57.600> cutoff<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:58.190> I've<00:02:59.190> looked<00:02:59.489> at<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
fuel cutoff out I've looked at the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.309 
fuel cutoff out I've looked at the
wiring<00:02:59.970> down<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.519> was<00:03:03.319> all

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
wiring down here this this was all

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.650 
wiring down here this this was all
clamped<00:03:05.100> together<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.209> don't<00:03:06.239> see<00:03:06.540> any

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
clamped together but I don't see any

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.970 
clamped together but I don't see any
breaks<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:08.780> anything<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.959> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.620> pulled<00:03:10.830> this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

under<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> dash<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.320> read<00:03:52.560> something<00:03:52.799> and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
under the dash I read something and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.220 
under the dash I read something and
watched<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.940> video<00:03:54.180> about<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.540> being<00:03:55.079> an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
watched a video about that being an

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.370 
watched a video about that being an
issue<00:03:56.569> thought<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.780> fixed<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.170> because<00:03:58.230> I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
issue thought that fixed it because I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.370 
issue thought that fixed it because I
drove<00:03:58.590> about<00:03:58.709> 200<00:03:59.220> miles<00:03:59.400> and<00:04:00.079> did<00:04:01.079> not<00:04:01.200> have

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
cruising down the highway it went into

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
cruising down the highway it went into

for to fix this issue am I going to need
to<00:04:16.139> have<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.320> ECM<00:04:16.739> checked<00:04:17.010> out<00:04:17.190> or<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:20.190> it

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
to have the ECM checked out or is it

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
to have the ECM checked out or is it
going<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.549> be<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.700> possible<00:04:21.830> wiring<00:04:22.830> issue<00:04:23.900> so

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
going to be a possible wiring issue so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.260 
going to be a possible wiring issue so
there's<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.169> bunch<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.470> wiring

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
there's a bunch of wiring

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.159 
there's a bunch of wiring
it<00:04:26.900> ties<00:04:27.319> together<00:04:27.530> into<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.870> plug<00:04:29.870> there

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
it ties together into that plug there

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.850 
it ties together into that plug there
and<00:04:30.590> then<00:04:30.740> branches<00:04:31.190> off<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.699> really<00:04:32.660> need<00:04:32.780> a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
and then branches off I really need a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.200 
and then branches off I really need a
