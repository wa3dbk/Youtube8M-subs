this white tool right here this white
cursor<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> sub<00:00:52.680> select<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.760> click<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> body

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
cursor to sub select and click the body

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
cursor to sub select and click the body
parts<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:54.989> different<00:00:55.140> colors<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

parts and make them different colors so
let's<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.520> make<00:00:56.670> another<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.059> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
let's just make another one with this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
let's just make another one with this
guy<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:58.020> mister<00:00:58.350> starts<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.829> simple<00:00:59.250> let's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
guy it mister starts pretty simple let's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.599 
guy it mister starts pretty simple let's
do<00:00:59.699> bigger<00:01:00.350> sticks<00:01:01.350> figure<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:02.039> control<00:01:02.489> out

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
do bigger sticks figure our control out

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
do bigger sticks figure our control out
five<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> guess<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
five I guess and they know that and you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.560 
five I guess and they know that and you
notice<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.820> look<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> same<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.540> were

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
notice how they look the same if I were

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.620 
notice how they look the same if I were
to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.850> or<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.090> come<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> same

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to do this or just come in the same

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
to do this or just come in the same
position<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> comparison<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
position so you see the comparison and I

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.330 
position so you see the comparison and I
know<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.409> looking<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.740> his<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.010> glove

than this one it's meant to be like that
because<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> game<00:01:20.100> he's<00:01:20.280> wearing<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because in the game he's wearing on a

because in the game he's wearing on a
piece<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> armor<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
piece of armor on this one like a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
piece of armor on this one like a
lighter<00:01:22.439> piece<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.770> armor<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.700> trying<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
lighter piece of armor that's trying to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.190

blue<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> little<00:02:16.030> trick<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> learned<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
blue it's a little trick I learned so it

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.210 
blue it's a little trick I learned so it
doesn't<00:02:17.200> look<00:02:17.260> exactly<00:02:17.319> like<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:18.040> this

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
doesn't look exactly like this one this

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.759 
doesn't look exactly like this one this
one<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.489> low<00:02:18.640> saturation<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:22.769> like

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
one had low saturation but it is like

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.589 
one had low saturation but it is like
your<00:02:23.950> again<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.400> fire<00:02:24.580> custom<00:02:24.879> this<00:02:25.269> time

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
your again the fire custom this time

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.740 
your again the fire custom this time
with<00:02:25.750> saturation<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.319> play<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.750> then

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
with saturation to play with this then

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.830 
with saturation to play with this then
I'll<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.019> more<00:02:29.319> gray<00:02:30.159> or<00:02:30.599> socio<00:02:31.599> maybe

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I'll make it more gray or socio maybe

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.380 
I'll make it more gray or socio maybe
220<00:02:32.260> now<00:02:36.030> little<00:02:37.030> bit<00:02:37.120> less<00:02:37.769> there<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.390> okay

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
220 now little bit less there we go okay

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.289 
220 now little bit less there we go okay
and<00:02:40.690> now<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.049> should<00:02:41.170> look<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.530> one<00:02:42.299> so

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
and now it should look like this one so

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.030 
and now it should look like this one so
your<00:02:43.450> saturation<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.110> basic<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.860> little

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
your saturation is basic it's a little

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.259 
your saturation is basic it's a little
bit<00:02:45.159> like<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.310> when<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:45.610> flat<00:02:45.849> or<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.150> not

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
bit like that when it's flat or it's not

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.740 
bit like that when it's flat or it's not
so<00:02:46.420> dark<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:48.459> saturation<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.269> basic

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
so dark your saturation is a basic

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.110 
so dark your saturation is a basic
control<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.829> need<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.220> when<00:02:52.000> you're

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
control you need to know when you're
