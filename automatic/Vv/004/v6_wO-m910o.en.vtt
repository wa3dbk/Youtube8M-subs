today<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.039> using<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.640> lightweight<00:00:47.879> polypro<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899

it's<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.260> bit<00:00:49.469> harder<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.100> use

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it's a little bit harder for me to use

it's a little bit harder for me to use
on<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.700> body<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.050> easier<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> flip<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
on my body but it's easier to flip and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
on my body but it's easier to flip and

take my arm out to the side the hoop
should<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.610> touching<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.780> inner<00:02:04.049> elbow<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:05.250> if

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
should be touching my inner elbow now if

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
should be touching my inner elbow now if
I<00:02:05.610> shoot<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.060> arm<00:02:06.270> out<00:02:06.420> nice<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.960> long<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
I shoot my arm out nice and long and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
I shoot my arm out nice and long and
then<00:02:07.619> take<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.429> fingers<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> air<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.539> wrap

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
then take my fingers in the air and wrap

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.350 
then take my fingers in the air and wrap
them<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
them up and over the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.050 
them up and over the
OOP<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.870> he<00:02:12.620> will<00:02:12.770> be<00:02:12.890> hanging<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.550> front<00:02:13.580> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
OOP that he will be hanging in front of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.930 
OOP that he will be hanging in front of
my<00:02:14.240> bicep<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.960> means<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.130> can<00:02:16.370> fold<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
my bicep that means that I can fold it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.750 
my bicep that means that I can fold it
backwards<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.920> going<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.250> look<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.610> little

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
backwards so it's going to look a little

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.800 
backwards so it's going to look a little
bit<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.770> at<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.760> point<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.600> hoop

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
bit like this at that point the hoop

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110 
bit like this at that point the hoop
opens<00:02:24.260> up<00:02:24.440> right<00:02:24.680> there<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.970> feel

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
opens up right there and I just feel

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.690 
opens up right there and I just feel
like<00:02:26.260> jumping<00:02:27.260> through<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.460> little

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
like jumping through now that little

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.480 
like jumping through now that little
jump<00:02:28.940> through<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:29.420> more<00:02:29.570> time<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:31.100> hoop<00:02:31.340> is

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
jump through one more time the hoop is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.880 
jump through one more time the hoop is
in<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> vertical<00:02:31.910> plane<00:02:32.330> it's<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.470> my<00:02:33.620> right

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
in a vertical plane it's in my right

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.100 
in a vertical plane it's in my right
hand<00:02:34.190> right<00:02:34.490> now<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.510> I'm<00:02:35.600> going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.780> use<00:02:35.930> my

hand right now so I'm going to use my

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.300 
hand right now so I'm going to use my
left<00:02:36.350> leg<00:02:36.620> first

now let's try a similar version but this
time<00:03:21.170> from<00:03:21.380> shoulder<00:03:21.890> hooping<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.850> are

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
time from shoulder hooping so you are

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.090 
time from shoulder hooping so you are
going<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.600> start<00:03:23.870> shoulder<00:03:24.350> hooping<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.860> your

do so so the same idea applies your

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.860 
do so so the same idea applies your
thumb<00:04:55.810> is<00:04:56.020> up<00:04:56.139> and<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:57.669> can<00:04:57.820> actually<00:04:58.030> turn<00:04:58.570> in

thumb is up and you can actually turn in
a<00:04:58.960> circle<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.010> what's<00:05:00.220> going<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.490> happen<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:01.210> if

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
a circle so what's going to happen is if

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.270
