00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.819
 voted for a small card 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:50.030
 now we are waiting for people and then it will start 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:55.739
 game who has 75 teams in each team 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.020
 each team has a plus 75 life 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.370
 life decreases when you pick 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.520
 you break someone else's nexus that is and i am now 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.280
 went into the green I have to break the Lexus 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.280
 their red and yellow is the main task 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:20.570
 phases 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.980
 in the first phase this is the preparatory phase 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:30.650
 2 phase gold appears in the mines at 3 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.360
 phase in the center appear diamonds and 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.570
 get rid bosses well here until bosses 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 no, they were only at chewbacca surpassed 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.419
 they were removed 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 I still admit that the second phase 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:50.910
 appears you can break us on the first 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.479
 phase can not fourth phase nothing 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.630
 happens in phase 5 when you break 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:03.440
 find another 20 siths breaking like miner 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:06.390
 not about one life but 2 hours for phase 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.990
 every minute decreases 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.060
 life I will now pause because 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.270
 that tells me how much else I have to 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.270
 to wait
