between your cartilage and your and your
skin<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.720> could<00:01:30.869> try<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.080> drain<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> out

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
skin and you could try it drain it out

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
skin and you could try it drain it out
but<00:01:31.799> there's<00:01:31.950> always<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.880> that's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
but there's always some of it that's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
but there's always some of it that's
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> stay<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.200> an

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
going to stay there and it's an

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
going to stay there and it's an
accumulation<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.340> gonna<00:01:35.460> hit<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> again

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
accumulation you're gonna hit it again

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.550 
accumulation you're gonna hit it again
eventually<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.470> then

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
eventually a little bit more and then

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.320 
eventually a little bit more and then
it's<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> coagulate<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
it's going to coagulate and then the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.910 
it's going to coagulate and then the
cartilage<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:39.990> start<00:01:40.170> deforming<00:01:40.799> as

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
cartilage is gonna start deforming as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
cartilage is gonna start deforming as
well<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.429> it's<00:01:41.580> just<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.030> cumulation<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.960> think

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
well and it's just a cumulation I think

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
well and it's just a cumulation I think
this<00:01:43.289> doesn't<00:01:44.009> happen<00:01:44.130> overnight<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.880> an

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this doesn't happen overnight it's an

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
this doesn't happen overnight it's an
accumulation<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.869> training<00:01:46.289> where

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
accumulation of training where

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649 
accumulation of training where
eventually<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.460> keeps<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.539> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
eventually just keeps going going and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
eventually just keeps going going and
hopefully<00:01:49.380> killers<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> mine<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> stays

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
hopefully killers like mine and stays

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.840 
hopefully killers like mine and stays
like<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:52.470> found<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> ever<00:01:53.580> seen
