00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
this process can take anywhere from I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190 
this process can take anywhere from I
guess<00:02:20.080> 10<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.400> 30<00:02:21.940> minutes<00:02:22.239> i<00:02:22.569> guess<00:02:22.600> depend<00:02:23.110> on

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
guess 10 to 30 minutes i guess depend on

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
curly and it just it definitely reminds

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.990

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
me so much of sin if I had to start when

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.880 
me so much of sin if I had to start when
I<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.630> typically<00:02:53.019> like<00:02:53.769> I
