00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.770
 Hi , welcome to the picture today, let's go. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.230
 start with the flower structure 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.490
 the flower is nothing more than a branch 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.099
 specialized with fertile leaves and not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.669
 fertile and the flowers are the structures 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:30.050
 angiosperm reproductive systems are four 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.950
 the types of sheets modified 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.000
 flower constituents 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 strains petals and stamens by car 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 Let's talk about each one of them. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 To begin I will draw here a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.480
 peduncle or receptacle which the structure 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.190
 that supports flower 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.940
 we have here then the cells that are 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.860
 generally green and stay here in the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.720
 outermost region 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:08.609
 so here we have the cells that have the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.689
 function to protect the floral bud that is 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:18.439
 the stage where the flower has not yet opened 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:22.609
 and the set of bills formed the chalice 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:29.429
 after ours we have the 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:33.200
 petals that are usually colored and 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:37.380
 the petals have the function of attracting 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.130
 pollinating agents for example the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 insects and beyond color 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have the scent that also attract the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.179
 pollinating agents and the nectar that is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.929
 a sugary solution and that many 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.439
 insects use as food and the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.999
 Nectar is produced by glands 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 stay here at the base of the petals 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:10.050
 so we have the petals here with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.850
 main attraction function of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.300
 pollinators and the set of petals 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.440
 we call corolla 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.010
 and the crown structure together with the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 cup may be called period either 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.610
 so corolla plus chalice is what they would have 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.290
 both there and there the two vertices that the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.400
 fertile floral elements that form the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.850
 reproductive systems are called gynee- 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.630
 the female structure a set of 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.800
 fertile leaves that will form the ovule 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.530
 the androecium which is the set of leaves 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.190
 which will form the grains of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.490
 Pollen today deserved is a set of 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.350
 carpel light the cartello is a leaf 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:14.130
 also modified and present 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.480
 an opening here on its surface 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:23.660
 the cartel has a structure 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:31.050
 which ends with a portion of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:34.770
 that the region here below is 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.290
 each part of this cartel receives the name 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.380
 for example the aperture is called 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:48.989
 stigma that opening will receive the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:55.910
 pollen grains that portion all there is 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:04:02.070
 called a stylus and this portion 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.980
 is called the ovary and is 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.459
 in ovary we will find the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.470
 ovules that will land with the beasts that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.049
 the female gamete 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 then all this set of stigma 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:24.480
 stiletto and ovary compose reason why 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.729
 will form the gini is yours 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.160
 already in the male part we have the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.180
 stamens are stamens 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.170
 also modified leaves and remind 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.950
 so the structure of a toothpick 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:49.920
 we have here the asti of the stamen that is 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:54.270
 called the fillet and the dilated portion of the 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.900
 stamen is the antero era where the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.980
 production of anther pollen grains 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:06.630
 more fillet make up a stands for me 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.510
 set of stamens is not only 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.520
 to remember that the set of stamens 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.850
 is the androceutical that will be the structure 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:22.860
 male reproductive system and a 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:26.820
 set of carpello make up gynoe 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.630
 is the female reproductive structure and 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:34.650
 then we have here the flower that goes to 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.970
 reproductive structure of angiosperms and 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.860
 one of the great evolutive novelties 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.180
 this group and that's what I want too 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.580
 highlight is that the appearance of the flower 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.510
 allowed for greater diversification of 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.990
 and this is because the grains of 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.110
 pollen that are stored in flowers 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.560
 they can be dispersed now not only 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.340
 by the wind but also by animals 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.660
 insects and water and by man himself and there 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:12.480
 is greater dispersion of these pollen grains 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.600
 increases the genetic exchange between 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.830
 plants from different regions and this 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.810
 increases genetic variability and 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.460
 with which the sperm angel can occupy 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.770
 definitely a terrestrial environment and 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.280
 In the next class we will talk about the 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:36.650
 formation of the pollen grains in the 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.650
 Do not miss the legs until then.
