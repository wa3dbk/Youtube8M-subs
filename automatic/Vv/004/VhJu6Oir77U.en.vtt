00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
actually secure any of them further down

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually secure any of them further down
the<00:01:36.600> bottom<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.310> rigid<00:01:38.490> so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.590 
really neat ream it looks really tidy as
well<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.640> let<00:01:59.790> me<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.000> try<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.360> gonna

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
well so let me just try it that's gonna

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
well so let me just try it that's gonna
grab<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:03.439> surface<00:02:04.439> pro<00:02:04.649> 3<00:02:04.759> I'm<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:06.060> gonna<00:02:06.149> see

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
grab my surface pro 3 I'm just gonna see

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.210 
grab my surface pro 3 I'm just gonna see
what<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> looks<00:02:06.719> like

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
what it looks like

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.170 
what it looks like
actually<00:02:08.220> putting<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> on

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.780 

so<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.670> let's<00:02:16.670> see

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so here we go so this is the let's see

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.790 
so here we go so this is the let's see
if<00:02:16.850> its<00:02:16.940> approach<00:02:17.120> ring<00:02:20.530> looks<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.650> it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
if its approach ring looks like it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.280 
if its approach ring looks like it's
pretty<00:02:24.160> straightforward<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.640> regards<00:02:26.060> to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
pretty straightforward in regards to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:37.360 
pretty straightforward in regards to
make<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.440> sure<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:31.300> snapped<00:02:32.300> on<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
make it sure it's just snapped on and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.920 
make it sure it's just snapped on and
then<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.510> basically<00:02:38.990> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> be<00:02:40.930> twisting

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
then it's basically going to be twisting

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:51.430 
then it's basically going to be twisting
it<00:02:42.020> over<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.930> putting<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.470> bar<00:02:48.740> on<00:02:49.060> back<00:02:50.440> now

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
it over and putting that bar on back now

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.610 
it over and putting that bar on back now
it<00:02:51.560> comes<00:02:51.800> with<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.460> little<00:02:53.210> allen<00:02:53.510> key<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.380> two

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
it comes with a little allen key and two

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
it comes with a little allen key and two
screws

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
screws

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.170 
screws
that's<00:02:56.840> pretty<00:02:57.020> gonna<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.320> straightforward

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
that's pretty gonna be straightforward

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.150 
that's pretty gonna be straightforward
now<00:02:59.180> one<00:02:59.930> thing<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.680> about<00:03:00.830> this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
now one thing that I do like about this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.320 
now one thing that I do like about this
is<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.240> very<00:03:02.900> actually<00:03:03.590> very<00:03:03.830> light

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
is that it is very actually very light

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.700 
is that it is very actually very light

case<00:03:55.550> that<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.760> reviewed<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.239> while<00:03:56.450> back<00:03:56.630> where

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
case that I reviewed a while back where

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800 
case that I reviewed a while back where
it's<00:03:56.930> got<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.080> built<00:03:57.320> in<00:03:57.470> one<00:03:58.450> this<00:03:59.450> actually

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
it's got a built in one this actually

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.370 
it's got a built in one this actually
keeps<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.410> actual<00:04:01.280> one<00:04:01.820> that's<00:04:01.970> built<00:04:02.120> in

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
keeps the actual one that's built in

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.940 
keeps the actual one that's built in
available<00:04:03.380> so<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> basically<00:04:04.820> use<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:06.709> that

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
available so you basically use is that

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.040 
available so you basically use is that
so<00:04:07.250> some<00:04:08.000> people<00:04:08.090> will<00:04:08.300> like<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.510> because

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
it's they like this one here it's nice

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.850 
it's they like this one here it's nice
and<00:04:11.810> easy<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.170> it's<00:04:12.260> got<00:04:12.380> some<00:04:12.500> really<00:04:12.709> good

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
and easy and it's got some really good

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860 
and easy and it's got some really good
movements<00:04:13.430> some<00:04:13.730> people<00:04:13.940> may<00:04:14.090> not<00:04:14.330> because<00:04:14.720> it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
movements some people may not because it

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.159 
movements some people may not because it
opens<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.620> up<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.950> scratching<00:04:16.600> but<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.660> think

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
opens this up to scratching but I think

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.840 
opens this up to scratching but I think
it's<00:04:18.290> really<00:04:18.709> nice<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.130> really<00:04:19.340> do<00:04:19.460> like<00:04:19.609> it's

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
it's really nice I really do like it's

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.840 
it's really nice I really do like it's
surprising<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.720> how<00:04:20.989> light<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.550> hasn't

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
surprising you how light it is it hasn't

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.840 
surprising you how light it is it hasn't
added<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.419> lot<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.020> bulk

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
added a lot of bulk

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.830 
added a lot of bulk
to<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.620> service<00:04:27.620> pro<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:29.330> would<00:04:29.539> feel<00:04:29.660> but

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
to the service pro it would feel but

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.180 
to the service pro it would feel but
they<00:04:29.930> don't<00:04:30.050> wants<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.259> put<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.530> bar<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:30.770> that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
they don't wants to put that bar on that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.520 
they don't wants to put that bar on that
bar<00:04:31.850> we'll<00:04:31.970> give<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.210> lot<00:04:32.360> more<00:04:32.509> stimulus<00:04:33.259> to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
bar we'll give it a lot more stimulus to

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.800 
bar we'll give it a lot more stimulus to
it<00:04:33.620> as<00:04:33.710> well<00:04:33.860> even<00:04:34.789> saying<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.419> even<00:04:35.570> without
