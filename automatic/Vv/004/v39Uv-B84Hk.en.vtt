00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello today at eleven already let's talk one 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 little more about the teams we visited 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 previous programs corinthians 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.030
 smart steamrollers and são paulo storm 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.130
 let's find out how the organization and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 structure of these teams know how you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.310
 can play some of them now at eleven 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310
 games 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.970
 o são paulo is in was founded in 2006 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.460
 of 31 August 2006 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.790
 It's because of these athletes the Sao Paulo times 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.410
 juveniles gasparri wedges the first bid 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.850
 aerial fat and video games are not they 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.230
 emerged through these four friends who 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.980
 I intended to set up a team to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.760
 they and and and from that the team was 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.920
 evolving to sportv founded in 2007 and 3 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.140
 of February 2007 when the sound of two 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.300
 teams that were appearing by flag 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.129
 in the sacs a super centuries 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.619
 there we had few players of the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.680
 two teams end up dying coming to an end 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.410
 joining began in December and February 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.520
 already joined was already enrolled in the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:23.810
 league flag são paulo and was founded in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.630
 2006 was a way of saying that was 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.050
 even came up with the idea of ​​a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 videogame team and it was when he was in the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.159
 our first contact with the sport 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.720
 through a video game I 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.140
 I'll see out about dae 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 the idea then is when he began to partnership 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.060
 of chinese owners with corinthians 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.759
 started in 2008 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.250
 at the beginning of 2008 more or less 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.149
 already been four years of partnership 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.619
 success 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.439
 I think since we started with 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.900
 this American football partnership in the country 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.670
 only evolved major inspection 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.880
 a year of play that we have to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.050
 paint field is the water that provides water 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.650
 pro adversary rent the field is ink 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.960
 etc 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.700
 the trip is that we have buses that 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.050
 have to pay the bus for 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 travel right 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
 sam is a big cast just going 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.790
 practically forty-five 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.560
 players to the game then the with travel 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.610
 stay when we're going to play outside 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.930
 I think this is the main 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.300
 chile expense 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.550
 the innovation that is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.190
 a labor force company to 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.850

 the main sources of income of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.600
 history are the same athletes are us 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.870

 they have access to this basis of our 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.910
 products that we sell or 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.100
 sponsors that is to contribute ua 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.660
 moment are the sponsors, right? 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.790
 brought silver helping us 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.380

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.580
 equipment for specific training 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.830

 training and games on Sundays is the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.380
 six chapters and there depends on the pt the date 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.150
 of the game in question is this structure. 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.590
 What we are seeing is the park is 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
 we do not have a larger structure and has 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.459
