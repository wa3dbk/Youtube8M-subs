three in the piano tuning theory video

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.230 
three in the piano tuning theory video
series<00:00:13.549> and<00:00:14.549> today<00:00:14.759> we're<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.120> be

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
series and today we're going to be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.420 
series and today we're going to be
studying<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.929> learning<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.310> are

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
studying and learning about what are

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.160 
studying and learning about what are
called<00:00:17.460> beats<00:00:18.590> in<00:00:19.590> piano<00:00:20.369> tuning<00:00:20.850> it's

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
called beats in piano tuning it's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.269 
called beats in piano tuning it's
important<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> understand<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.800> beats<00:00:23.039> are

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
important to understand what beats are

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.509 
important to understand what beats are
so<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.650> listen<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> correct

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so that you can listen for the correct

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
so that you can listen for the correct
things<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.630> tuning<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> notes<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.580> our

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
things in in tuning the notes in our

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
things in in tuning the notes in our
previous<00:00:30.179> videos<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.590> talked

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
previous videos we have first talked

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
previous videos we have first talked
about<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.369> notes<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> intervals<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> piano

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
about the notes and intervals on a piano

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.139 
about the notes and intervals on a piano
and<00:00:34.110> then<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.800> talked<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.160> partials<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and then we talked about partials in the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
and then we talked about partials in the
video<00:00:36.480> part<00:00:36.809> two<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.950> today<00:00:38.160> we're<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
video part two but today we're going to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.850 
video part two but today we're going to
be<00:00:38.550> talking<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:38.940> beats<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.590> beats

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
be talking about beats now what beats

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
be talking about beats now what beats
are<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:45.210> notes<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
are if we think about the notes on a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.180 
are if we think about the notes on a
piano<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> how<00:00:46.770> their<00:00:48.620> sound<00:00:49.620> waves

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
piano and how their sound waves

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
piano and how their sound waves
okay<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.940> you've<00:00:51.120> seen<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.629> you've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
okay so you've seen so you've got this

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.639 
okay so you've seen so you've got this
this<00:00:52.800> Soundwave<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.469> each

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
this Soundwave here that for each

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.290 
this Soundwave here that for each
particular<00:00:56.070> note<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> course<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> goes

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
particular note and of course it goes

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.709 
particular note and of course it goes
very<00:00:57.539> quickly<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.739> example<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> above

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
very quickly for example the a above

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.820 
very quickly for example the a above
middle<00:01:00.930> C<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> four<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.140> say<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
middle C or a four that they say that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.370 
middle C or a four that they say that
that's<00:01:05.010> usually<00:01:05.400> tuned<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.970> 440<00:01:06.840> okay<00:01:07.200> what

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that's usually tuned to 440 okay what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240 
that's usually tuned to 440 okay what
that<00:01:07.530> means<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.430> waves<00:01:09.710> 440<00:01:10.710> times<00:01:10.979> per

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that means is it it waves 440 times per

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630 
that means is it it waves 440 times per
second<00:01:12.229> which<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.470> fast<00:01:13.830> okay<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.490> those

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
second which is very fast okay in those

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.780 
second which is very fast okay in those
waves<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:16.020> create<00:01:16.740> create<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> sound

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
waves are what create create the sound

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.980 
waves are what create create the sound
okay<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:19.850> on<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.939> piano<00:01:21.240> you've<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.960> you've

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
okay now on a piano you've if you've

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
okay now on a piano you've if you've
probably<00:01:22.470> noticed<00:01:22.770> there's<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.700> one

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
probably noticed there's more than one

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.960 
probably noticed there's more than one
string<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:25.350> each<00:01:25.439> individual<00:01:26.070> note<00:01:26.340> okay

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
string for each individual note okay

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
string for each individual note okay
we're<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.600> showing<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.680> examples

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
we're going to be showing some examples

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.560 
we're going to be showing some examples
of<00:01:29.549> beats<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.689> beats<00:01:30.930> sound<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:32.570> from

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of beats what beats sound like from

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
of beats what beats sound like from
unison<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.259> okay<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
unison so okay so we're going to be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
unison so okay so we're going to be
comparing<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:35.610> strings<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.840> same<00:01:36.869> note

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
comparing two strings of the same note

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
comparing two strings of the same note
okay<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.579> happens<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:40.079> beats<00:01:40.350> are

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
okay what happens is what beats are

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
okay what happens is what beats are
they're<00:01:41.189> created<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:42.060> you've<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:42.960> two<00:01:44.210> two

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
they're created when you've got two two

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.600 
they're created when you've got two two
waves<00:01:45.509> okay<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> case<00:01:46.950> we've<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.399> two

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
waves okay or in this case we've got two

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.170 
waves okay or in this case we've got two
strings<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.450> both<00:01:48.689> vibrating<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
strings that are both vibrating and

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.490 
strings that are both vibrating and
theoretically<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.840> them<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> sound

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
theoretically if we want them to sound

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.240 
theoretically if we want them to sound
in<00:01:52.920> tune<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:54.119> both<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:55.250> vibrating

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
in tune they both have to be vibrating

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700 
in tune they both have to be vibrating
at<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> exact<00:01:57.119> same<00:01:57.509> speed<00:01:58.020> okay<00:01:58.439> we're<00:01:58.619> going

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
at the exact same speed okay we're going

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.399 
at the exact same speed okay we're going
to<00:01:58.799> I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.100> using<00:01:59.280> a<00:02:00.110> three<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.320> as

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to I'm going to be using a three here as

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.300 
to I'm going to be using a three here as
an<00:02:01.560> example<00:02:01.680> okay<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.469> those<00:02:04.770> two

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
an example okay and if if those two

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
an example okay and if if those two
strings<00:02:05.969> aren't<00:02:06.299> completely<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.320> exactly<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
strings aren't completely or exactly in

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.040 
strings aren't completely or exactly in
tune<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.759> each<00:02:08.940> other<00:02:09.179> you're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
tune with each other you're going to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.490 
tune with each other you're going to
have

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
have

okay or a wave okay but those waves
if<00:02:18.860> one<00:02:19.340> beats<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.270> bit<00:02:20.390> faster

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
if one beats just a little bit faster

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.460 
if one beats just a little bit faster

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
those those waves aren't going to be

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.950 
those those waves aren't going to be
happening<00:02:25.310> at<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.610> exact<00:02:26.000> same<00:02:26.240> time<00:02:26.600> which

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
happening at the exact same time which

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.410 
happening at the exact same time which
causes<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.710> beats<00:02:27.950> okay<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:29.240> I'm<00:02:29.330> going

string auto-tune just a little bit I've
muted<00:03:57.689> the<00:03:58.019> left<00:03:58.230> string<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.739> c4

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.060 

there's<00:04:10.590> your<00:04:10.800> beat<00:04:10.950> right<00:04:11.160> there

okay you start by by rib be able to
recognize<00:04:22.770> them<00:04:22.980> on<00:04:23.160> Unison's<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.770> we

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
recognize them on Unison's but if we

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.760 
recognize them on Unison's but if we
take<00:04:26.100> that<00:04:26.750> c4<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.900> what<00:04:28.050> I'll<00:04:28.170> do<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:28.590> I'll

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
take that c4 and what I'll do now I'll

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.150 
take that c4 and what I'll do now I'll
pull<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.130> into<00:04:29.760> tune<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> remove<00:04:31.680> the

pull it into tune so that I remove the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:54.960 
pull it into tune so that I remove the
beat

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.969
