 Today I will tell you about how 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.490
 activate windows 7 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 means that for curd for this basically 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.090
 first you need to do this for us to start 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.640
 will need to download 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 Well, I can credit this download 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:34.410
 I will lay out the program under the video and also for 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.719
 start and first we need to disable 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.390
 antivirus so that it just doesn't 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.390
 fired on the finger and just 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:56.890
 all here is this program just 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.199
 I turn on the antivirus and we are not afraid of anything 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.199
 continue to punish 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:08.050
 then we will need to go to the panel 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:10.270
 security system controls here 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.509
 see I have Windows activated 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.440
 this and activating with this wind 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:21.039
 choose the administrator administrator and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:26.409
 shorter here all this we do not need the most 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:29.080
 we are the main sber service then we are there 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.990
 we are looking for a software advocate 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.369
 stop this service 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.460
 you don't run i just stop 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.670
 stop the service do not start 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 services can be left open 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 further after that we launch our 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 activator 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.920
 after that we click apply here at 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:59.070
 I am written by the river because as if I already 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.740
 activated and if you press her robert it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 retire will light old 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:12.170

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.360
 I remember exactly and in short there will be 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.709
 computer restart after 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.580
 reboot what do you do with you 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 turn on the computer and then you do 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.980
 I don't know what antivirus you have there 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.610
 turn off the antivirus here I have it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610
 done manually 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.130
 then we go to the control panel 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:51.550
 administration 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:53.650
 brand service and look for there protector 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 software and you have it 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.700
 will turn on 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:06.540
 and therefore and then to check already 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.370
 make sure your Windows 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.460
 activated you want 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.290
 system and here it will write 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.270
 activation windows will execute 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.780
 means the activator is suitable for any 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.800
 windows version regardless of whether at 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.780
 what is x64 or x86 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 Here I had another x86 and I already 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.660
 activator activated her eat without 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:43.580
 There are now 4 problems for me and not 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.580
 I know everything is fine too 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.560
 I do not know 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.480

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.610
 windows update center keys on 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.610
 update means you turn it off and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.379
 no more updates 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.319

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.450
