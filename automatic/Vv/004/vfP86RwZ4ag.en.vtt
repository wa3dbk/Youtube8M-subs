separate<00:02:20.650> networks<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.810> think<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.870> even

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
separate networks I think that even

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.650 
separate networks I think that even
counts<00:02:23.440> for<00:02:23.590> cellular<00:02:24.099> like<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.569> you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
counts for cellular like I think you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.410 
counts for cellular like I think you
need<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.870> hook<00:02:26.079> up<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.440> Wi-Fi<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.150> here
