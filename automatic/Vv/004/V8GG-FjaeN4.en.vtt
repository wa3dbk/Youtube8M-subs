00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.430
 [Music] 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.070
 youtube or survival lists I 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.750
 I'm a potato and your survivor's guide and 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.779
 today we'll talk a little about the 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.230
 green project and I'll show you 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.660
 a small security system outta 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.820
 you to use in your house and show 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.060
 a bit of how the progress of the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.060
 our project here of self sufficiency 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.830
 What you see here is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.280
 continuation of the video I posted on 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.220
 day 26 is November if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.200
 was now at the end of November and 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.079
 beginning of December where to show 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.899
 How are you, Area 2 in the bank? 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.420
 this is already the area of eband 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.320
 I want you to have an idea of ​​the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.280
 the proportion that our cultivation has taken here 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 OK 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.309
 how can you see this one is that 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.220
 ball that I showed you right back in 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.140
 the video of the day 26 gives already 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.399
 It gives to get a good idea of how it was 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.830
 when I said I would do the project 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.649
 green, I made it very clear that I was going 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.640
 do it with the focus for survival 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.560
 lists 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.959
 The idea is this idea is to protect our 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.380
 home and today we have a series of 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.179
 plants is actually four 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.110
 species that were born here that I go 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:33.110
 show you now that I've prepared 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.479
 I had already thought of the truth in doing 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.679
 this wire mesh as you can 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.720
 see here O best to keep to 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.280
 protect an area with this 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.979
 same wire that a public person 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.590
 he wall she will fall exactly on top 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.330
 she will not be able to get down and 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.429
 as you can see here 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770
 this is a passage that leads from 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.989
 one area to another what I did was 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 next you can compare in the other 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:01.790
 video the size of these barriers here 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.030
 were okay 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.610
 they grew a lot the grape takes a lot 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.100
 more to grow than the pumpkin then 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.220
 not to waste time not to leave the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 unprotected area I'm already doing is 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.590
 from there and placing the ball after 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.480
 I'm going to prune the pump the plants 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.320
 will produce even suspended as you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.720
 can see here 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.610
 besides the pumpkins were also born the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 their cousins are cucumbers are 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.050
 probably due to composting 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.550
 also born a range of milan gives a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.290
 Look, a lot of people asked me there. 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.820
 because the chickens did not pick up 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.730
 destroyed my garden because it is a 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.400
 suspect vegetable garden I already made the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.100
 also serve as access control 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.110
 then besides planting upon it he 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.060
 serves as a barrier to what came from 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.980
 side of here do not enter the area there 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.140
 when to put a beautiful one of a gate there 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.880
 added to this green roof that I am 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.640
 making based on wire 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.100
 will be very difficult for a person could 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.140
 I jumped in there and tried to steal everything. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.450
 I'll join the useful to the pleasant I'll put 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.340
 a wire fence and I'll put the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.810
 leaves over to produce food 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.780
 so I'll be able to combine two 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.180
 utilities in a very small area is 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.340
 this kind of part I'm using to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.840
 learn on the wall, I think it's worth 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
 Worth talking about this plant 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.630
 A little more about this plant is that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.440
 A lot of people asked me the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.019
 pumpkin 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.570
 it reaches 40 times more nutrients 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.340
 more calcium than the pumpkin in 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.160
 yes, I think it's a peace option for anyone 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.410
 start the sustainability project and has 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.239
 little space because you simply 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.320
 can make the plant with and over and 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.209
 produce high 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.790
 Unfortunately she does not have the sheet. 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.190
 commercial value there is no culture is 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.069
 in Brazil from eating pumpkin leaf at 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.390
 nearest thing 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:04.180
 found in the market of the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:06.760
 Pumpkin is the spinach is as I showed it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.499
 For you the idea is that the grape pair 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.379
 eat all this plant at its most 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.389
 I'll go fast when I prune this plant. 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.620
 let it dry on the spot 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:19.000
 after that you pick up the dry leaf 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.489
 and makes a kind of flour 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.770
 with it the same wire that will be used 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.229
 to prevent access will ask for a 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.509
 person jumping the wall or coming down 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.599
 wall somewhere will also help 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.610
 the plant run and produce leaving the 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.919
 with a very low microclimate. 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.340
 cool you do not have too much work either 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.150
 not to put her in the place is enough 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:47.020
 and supporting the ends of the pump that she 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.210
 same goes showing and so you go 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.580
 to make a hitler rise on green roof 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.099
 the common wire that we use less 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.599
 these one hour steel wires end up 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.270
 accommodating the roof will go 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.460
 down the ideal is you picking up 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.620
 wire and passing from time to time and 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.199
 then you go up the whole structure 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.130
 again until an hour she runs it 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.979
 do not go down anymore 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.659
 the idea is to continue this wire mesh 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.830
 that we use here to support the 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:16.419
 plants are going to produce and also 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.159
 ensure safety with this here 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.520
 if you are worried about the welfare 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.259
 of the poor thing that will try to invade 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.130
 My house is going to do mine. 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.710
 family 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.440
 You're in the wrong place because I 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.750
 I'm literally doing this. 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.530
 to screw the life of the guy who has tabular 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.020
 my wall 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.289
 just make a post where you 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.630
 a serious security fault . 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.050
 defender of thief to say that you 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.479
 simply can not put a fence 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.670
 from inside your house and I'm 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.610
 exactly 15 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.890
 meters from all possible places 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.140
 so if the guy comes here try 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.720
 jump over this wall and close 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.260
 it is because their intentions are already very 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.150
 bad 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.510
 good people go to the front door 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.850
 Ring the bell and I expect to be answered. 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.030
 thief jolts wall I really hope 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.120
 You do not come here in the comments to speak. 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.370
 Look there are laws where you can not 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.180
 simply screw the thief into the 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.490
 your home 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.340
 My idea is really not to let the 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.680
 no chance for the guy politicians 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.020
 of brazil play in favor of bandit they 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.200
 disarm they do not let you 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.730
 put off guys that March and much 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.930
 because after all how does the 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.240
 thief will come into your house if you 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.520
 do it well I have points 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.530
 closing for this situation I prefer 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.910
 be processed than barbarised in the 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.880
 my home while you sleep 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.760
 What can I do to disrupt the 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.950
 life of an attacker I'm going to do this 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.650
 barbed wire roof validate a 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.510
 series of advantages first the guy does not 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.280
 will get one to get off even though he jumped 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.620
 the bureau of beauty that was a 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.530
 ladder has electric fence and cuts wire 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.270
 Alijó has tips and nail mat okay 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.340
 He's going down where he's going down in 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.210
 the top of a barbed wire mesh and not 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.060
 make a mistake 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.800
 the leaves of the plant will not stop the 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.660
 Guarani thorns are very 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.460
 under this type of defense does not 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
 depends on electrical energy does not depend 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.820
 no one's attention 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.280
 some things can happen here or the 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.500
 face get iron a year with it loses 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.810
 lots of time to get it out of here 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.300
 often a crisis scenario all 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:29.100
 what you need is the time you need 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.100
 to avoid invader surprise 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.070
 I also want to thank you again, and that's all. 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.740
 world that helped in green design 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.280
 those donations greatly facilitated our 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.350
 work is that here is our area one already 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.760
 we also have news from the other 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.770
 side and I believe now in January 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.810
 I'll still show you more about 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.180
 This is for you guys, it was worth watching. 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.800
