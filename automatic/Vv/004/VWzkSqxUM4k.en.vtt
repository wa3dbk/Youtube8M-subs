00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.830
 It's going to be personal in our 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.140
 today unfortunately a video with what I 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.750
 I do not like to make you a video of how 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.320
 one does not do it again I witnessed 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.090
 poor installation and partners in the area 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.589
 eletronic security 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.019
 we go through times that work in the 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.839
 same segment we work on and 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.279
 make a type of installation this way 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.140
 it's ridiculous 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.050
 is a lack of respect not only for 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.349
 the common technician for the consumer cup 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.960
 who is buying the equipment being 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.610
 installed incorrectly by running away from 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 all standards 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.580
 if you pick up the installation guide from 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.060
 some equipment 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.070
 they inform you that a plant is electric 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.720
 pain can not stay together with 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.950
 electronic equipment here a ranking 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:58.570
 where has tv where dvd has equipment 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:01.570
 antenna sound of rock on top of wiring 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.329
 authorization of the shock 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.899
 passing along with sound antenna wiring 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.789
 tv dvd 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.920
 so the staff here in no way 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.319
 thing is happening you consumer 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.350
 who purchased the equipment from this 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:19.569
 so the guy was like that. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.380
 Skin to fix it, it's wrong, it can not be 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.460
 done like this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.840
 ok it 's you that's in pain never install 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.210
 thus 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.819
 This is wrong, you may be almost 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.749
 to have your client burn is 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.429
 your fault 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:39.069
 the sermon installed the good equipment 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.670
 right but wrong 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:45.520
 many times the customer goes to a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.079
 thought more because the guy 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.990
 not a professional 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.590
 it does a zero installation with this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.850
 it was the touch that liked the jewel 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.310

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.170
 power so more people you want a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.479
 technician who knows he's wrong 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.389
 share you will give a google 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.969
 demonstrates his work by letting me know 

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.320
 I have a video so it shows how it is. 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.940
 Wrong installation ok 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.560
