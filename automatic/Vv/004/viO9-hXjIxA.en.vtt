00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually rip up to the 50 gigabyte they

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.929 
actually rip up to the 50 gigabyte they
can<00:01:40.290> only<00:01:40.380> rope<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> single<00:01:41.490> layer<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
can only rope up to the single layer and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.660 
can only rope up to the single layer and
that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> honestly<00:01:43.350> disappointment<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that is honestly disappointment so the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
that is honestly disappointment so the
best<00:01:44.880> thing<00:01:45.030> about<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
best thing about this is this going to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
best thing about this is this going to
rip<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> 50<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.979> bite<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.670> addition

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
rip up to the 50 get bite in addition

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.060 
rip up to the 50 get bite in addition

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
is that it does attract a couple of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.010 
is that it does attract a couple of
finger<00:02:34.819> prints<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> doesn't<00:02:35.630> feel<00:02:35.720> cheap

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
finger prints and it doesn't feel cheap

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
your power input and this will actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.720 
your power input and this will actually
need<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.720> power<00:02:56.930> input<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.290> power<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.100> once

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
need a power input to power up and once

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.190 
need a power input to power up and once
you<00:02:58.819> actually<00:02:59.120> power<00:02:59.330> up<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> power<00:02:59.840> cable

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
you actually power up the power cable

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.770 
you actually power up the power cable
and<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> USB<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:01.010> get<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> green<00:03:01.940> light<00:03:02.300> which

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and the USB you get a green light which

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.449 
and the USB you get a green light which
indicates<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.709> ready<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.069> go<00:03:04.220> so

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
indicates that this is ready to go so

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.070

some<00:03:05.000> things<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.300> really<00:03:05.360> like<00:03:05.690> about<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
some things I really like about the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.870 
some things I really like about the
drive<00:03:06.380> is<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.769> first<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.160> all<00:03:07.190> since<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:07.670> is

no firmware updates or anything like
that<00:03:46.790> it's<00:03:47.120> fantastic<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.900> also<00:03:48.260> like<00:03:48.590> the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
that it's fantastic I also like the

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.170 
that it's fantastic I also like the
software<00:03:49.160> that's<00:03:49.310> included<00:03:49.519> with<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:49.970> drive

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
software that's included with the drive

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.000 
software that's included with the drive
because<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:51.019> software<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.500> really<00:03:51.680> easy<00:03:51.829> to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
because the software is really easy to

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.220 
because the software is really easy to
use<00:03:52.220> install<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.850> quickly<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> software

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
use install it quickly and the software

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.009 
use install it quickly and the software
doesn't<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.489> much<00:03:55.760> space<00:03:56.480> required

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
doesn't have that much space required

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.810 
doesn't have that much space required
for<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.380> think<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.709> needs<00:03:57.890> about<00:03:58.190> 150

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
for it I think it just needs about 150

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.580 
for it I think it just needs about 150
megabytes<00:03:59.180> this<00:03:59.720> isn't<00:04:00.049> bad<00:04:00.170> at<00:04:00.290> all<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
get a lot of software you're gonna make

feel that greatly constructed and that

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.180 
feel that greatly constructed and that
is<00:05:29.569> kind<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.870> sad<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.080> say<00:05:30.349> because<00:05:30.740> this<00:05:31.009> is<00:05:31.159> a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
is kind of sad to say because this is a

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.430 
is kind of sad to say because this is a
fantastic<00:05:31.370> Drive<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.659> isn't<00:05:32.960> nicely

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
fantastic Drive and if it isn't nicely

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.959 
fantastic Drive and if it isn't nicely
made<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.860> feels<00:05:34.099> a<00:05:34.130> little<00:05:34.340> cheap<00:05:34.669> in<00:05:34.819> your

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
made it feels a little cheap in your

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.730 
made it feels a little cheap in your
hands<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.389> isn't<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.139> greatest<00:05:36.409> sign

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
hands that isn't the greatest sign

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.129 
hands that isn't the greatest sign
possible<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:38.509> bright<00:05:38.719> side<00:05:38.750> this

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
possible but on the bright side this

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.080 
possible but on the bright side this
functions<00:05:39.650> really<00:05:39.800> well<00:05:40.039> so<00:05:40.279> I<00:05:40.310> think<00:05:40.460> the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
functions really well so I think the

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.760 
functions really well so I think the
function<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.870> features<00:05:42.259> of<00:05:42.289> this<00:05:42.500> Drive

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.469 
function and the features of this Drive
make<00:05:42.979> up<00:05:43.159> for<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.789> drive<00:05:44.060> being<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.300> little

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
make up for this drive being a little

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.119 
make up for this drive being a little
bit<00:05:44.569> cheaply<00:05:44.810> made<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.710> if<00:05:45.830> you'll<00:05:46.039> be

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
bit cheaply made so if you'll be

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:47.499 
bit cheaply made so if you'll be
traveling<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.580> lot<00:05:46.759> with<00:05:46.879> this<00:05:47.060> drive<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.300> would

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
it's encryption so that's the only

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.800 
it's encryption so that's the only
really<00:06:28.800> problem<00:06:29.160> I've<00:06:29.280> had<00:06:29.310> playing<00:06:29.790> with<00:06:30.450> my

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
it and hopefully Sony will probably fix

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.080 
it and hopefully Sony will probably fix
that<00:06:34.470> in<00:06:34.590> a<00:06:34.650> later<00:06:34.830> update<00:06:34.920> but<00:06:35.430> that's<00:06:35.910> my

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
that in a later update but that's my

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
it really doesn't make that big of a

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.390 
it really doesn't make that big of a
deal<00:06:39.180> all<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:39.660> other<00:06:40.050> DVDs<00:06:40.500> up<00:06:40.650> tried<00:06:41.250> with

the<00:06:50.670> market<00:06:51.030> outside<00:06:51.120> for<00:06:51.600> blu-ray<00:06:51.780> external

the market outside for blu-ray external

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.980 
the market outside for blu-ray external
drives<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:52.920> honestly<00:06:53.790> I<00:06:53.820> don't<00:06:54.210> think<00:06:54.510> any<00:06:54.780> of

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.420 
drives and honestly I don't think any of
that<00:06:55.140> could<00:06:55.290> really<00:06:55.470> beat<00:06:55.650> this<00:06:55.830> one<00:06:56.040> at<00:06:56.310> the

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
that could really beat this one at the

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.340 
that could really beat this one at the
moment<00:06:56.790> this<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.150> a<00:06:57.270> really<00:06:57.540> great<00:06:57.690> Drive<00:06:58.050> it

moment this is a really great Drive it
plays<00:06:58.830> back<00:06:59.130> most<00:06:59.790> of<00:06:59.940> your<00:07:00.060> DVDs<00:07:00.510> that<00:07:00.780> you

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
plays back most of your DVDs that you

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.110

guys<00:07:01.020> probably<00:07:01.650> encounter<00:07:02.430> as<00:07:02.640> far<00:07:03.030> as

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
guys probably encounter as far as

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.150 
guys probably encounter as far as
blu-ray<00:07:03.420> DVDs<00:07:03.930> go<00:07:04.080> and<00:07:04.350> the<00:07:04.590> best<00:07:04.860> thing<00:07:05.040> is

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
blu-ray DVDs go and the best thing is

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.100 
blu-ray DVDs go and the best thing is
compatible<00:07:05.880> with<00:07:05.940> both<00:07:06.120> windows<00:07:06.600> and<00:07:06.630> Macs

kind of Drive as far as the pricing goes

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.160 
kind of Drive as far as the pricing goes
