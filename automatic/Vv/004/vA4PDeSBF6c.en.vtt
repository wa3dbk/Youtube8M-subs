 10 days after planting in coconut bark ALBION variety 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 at planting we used table stones in the A + category 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 8-12 mm rhizome in a 600-wool crate 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 first sign, calcium deficiency 

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:37.842
 calcium deficiency 

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.000
 a uniform NE culture can be observed 

00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.057
 we increase by one tenth the EC used, 

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:52.000
 we add Like microelements - the effect can be traced to "30 days" 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 let's not forget to sacrifice the first inflorescence 

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:14.212
 and calcium deficiency 

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.631
