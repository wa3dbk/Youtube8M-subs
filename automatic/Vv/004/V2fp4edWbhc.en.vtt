00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
now we have the transformer up let's go

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:16.030 
now we have the transformer up let's go
ahead<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.879> focus<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.090> little<00:03:09.269> bit<00:03:10.999> again

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and in both will say fine satellites

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.590 
and in both will say fine satellites
they're<00:03:47.430> there<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:49.350> did<00:03:50.350> start<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> Nexus<00:03:50.980> a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
they're there now did start the Nexus a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.320 
they're there now did start the Nexus a
few<00:03:52.600> seconds<00:03:53.050> faster<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.800> can<00:03:53.920> see<00:03:54.210> here

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
sorry he easily found handful of

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.750 
sorry he easily found handful of
satellites<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.570> actually<00:04:04.720> has<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.760> fix

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
satellites and it actually has a fix

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.220 
satellites and it actually has a fix
already<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.440> transformer<00:04:12.130> has<00:04:12.340> found

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
already and the transformer has found

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.920 
already and the transformer has found
two<00:04:14.230> satellites<00:04:15.420> no<00:04:16.420> fix

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.440 

for<00:04:22.530> satellites

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.120 

on<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:28.140> Nexus<00:04:29.090> no<00:04:30.090> fix<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:31.650> stand<00:04:31.920> back<00:04:32.100> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
on the Nexus no fix we stand back a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.830 
on the Nexus no fix we stand back a
little<00:04:32.250> bit<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.760> make<00:04:32.880> sure<00:04:32.940> my<00:04:33.090> body<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.600> not

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
little bit to make sure my body is not

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.700 
little bit to make sure my body is not
actually<00:04:35.090> interfering<00:04:39.350> Nexus<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.470> quite

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
actually interfering Nexus is quite

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.060 
actually interfering Nexus is quite
happy

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.840 

prime<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:47.000> found<00:04:50.260> six<00:04:51.260> seven<00:04:51.740> visible<00:04:52.310> for

prime is found six seven visible for

prime is found six seven visible for
used<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.360> fix<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:57.010> see<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.520> galaxy<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
used and fix so see that the galaxy the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:09.930 
used and fix so see that the galaxy the
Nexus<00:05:02.710> never<00:05:03.710> did<00:05:03.950> find<00:05:05.650> as<00:05:06.650> many<00:05:06.860> satellites

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.720 

but<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.720> did<00:05:11.900> eventually<00:05:12.140> find<00:05:12.460> enough<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.610> get

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
but it did eventually find enough to get

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.500 
but it did eventually find enough to get
a<00:05:13.760> fix<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:17.060> my<00:05:17.240> review<00:05:17.420> of<00:05:18.940> GPS<00:05:19.940> on<00:05:20.210> the
