00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
way that we do this is we have base or

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.269 
way that we do this is we have base or
foundation<00:00:26.150> rows<00:00:26.390> of<00:00:26.630> knitting<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.279> wherever

foundation rows of knitting and wherever
we<00:00:28.699> want<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.180> lacy<00:00:29.449> portion<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.439> be<00:00:30.619> we're

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
we want the lacy portion to be we're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.630 
we want the lacy portion to be we're
going<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.150> insert<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.930> needle<00:00:33.110> into<00:00:33.640> the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
going to insert the needle into the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.870 
going to insert the needle into the
stitch<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.710> wrap<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.920> yarn<00:00:36.950> around<00:00:37.309> twice

stitch and wrap the yarn around twice

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.940

then we're going to pull those two loops

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.130 
then we're going to pull those two loops
through<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.489> stitch<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.600> we're<00:00:42.110> just

each stitch and on the next row we're

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.180 
each stitch and on the next row we're
going<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.210> drop<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.930> stitches<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:51.770> we<00:00:51.950> made

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
knitting these stitches you're going to

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.139 
knitting these stitches you're going to
treat<00:00:59.750> these<00:01:00.199> two<00:01:00.559> loops<00:01:00.890> as<00:01:01.219> just<00:01:01.579> one<00:01:01.879> loop

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
treat these two loops as just one loop

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.380 
treat these two loops as just one loop
or<00:01:02.449> one<00:01:02.719> stitch<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:04.280> knitting<00:01:04.729> back<00:01:04.970> through

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
or one stitch so knitting back through

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.320 
or one stitch so knitting back through
you're<00:01:05.690> going<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:06.080> drop<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.189> second<00:01:07.790> loop<00:01:08.060> off

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're going to drop the second loop off

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.320 
you're going to drop the second loop off
the<00:01:08.689> needle<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.520> going<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:11.030> make

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the needle and that is going to make

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.580 
the needle and that is going to make
your<00:01:11.689> drop<00:01:12.080> stitches<00:01:13.570> another<00:01:14.570> very<00:01:14.960> simple

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
your drop stitches another very simple

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.570 
your drop stitches another very simple
way<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:16.390> create<00:01:17.390> lace<00:01:18.170> patterns<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.549> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
way to create lace patterns that is a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.289 
way to create lace patterns that is a
bit<00:01:20.150> more<00:01:20.540> difficult<00:01:21.159> than<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.640> drop<00:01:22.939> stitch

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
bit more difficult than the drop stitch

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.620 
bit more difficult than the drop stitch
pattern<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.500> discussed<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:26.390> use

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
pattern that we just discussed is to use

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.980 
pattern that we just discussed is to use
yarn<00:01:27.080> overs<00:01:28.119> along<00:01:29.119> with<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:30.340> decrease<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.540> I'm

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
yarn overs along with a decrease so I'm

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.789 
yarn overs along with a decrease so I'm
going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:34.000> knit<00:01:35.000> two<00:01:35.390> stitches<00:01:35.420> together<00:01:36.229> at

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
going to knit two stitches together at

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.859 
going to knit two stitches together at
the<00:01:37.159> beginning<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.729> my<00:01:37.850> row<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:38.509> I'm<00:01:38.630> just

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
the beginning of my row so I'm just

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.260 
the beginning of my row so I'm just
instead<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.950> going<00:01:40.159> through<00:01:40.520> one<00:01:40.790> stitch

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
instead of just going through one stitch

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.200 
instead of just going through one stitch
I'm<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.049> go<00:01:42.200> through<00:01:42.470> two<00:01:42.890> stitches<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
I'm going to go through two stitches the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.810 
I'm going to go through two stitches the
same<00:01:44.479> way<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.869> I'm<00:01:45.020> knitting<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.470> stitch<00:01:45.820> then

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
same way that I'm knitting a stitch then

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.260 
same way that I'm knitting a stitch then
wrapping<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.570> yarn<00:01:47.600> only<00:01:48.229> once<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.270> pulling

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
wrapping the yarn only once and pulling

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.630 
wrapping the yarn only once and pulling
it<00:01:50.390> through<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.170> sliding<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.890> off<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.310> needle

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.109 
it through and sliding it off the needle
and<00:01:52.880> then<00:01:53.630> I'm<00:01:53.780> going<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.170> yarn<00:01:54.770> over<00:01:54.950> which<00:01:55.939> is

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
and then I'm going to yarn over which is

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.149 
and then I'm going to yarn over which is
just<00:01:56.390> wrapping<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.170> yarn<00:01:57.200> around<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.009> right

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
just wrapping the yarn around the right

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.870 
just wrapping the yarn around the right
needle<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:59.600> it's<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.500> back<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.399> knit<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
needle so it's in the back to knit and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.179

that<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.450> creates<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.379> just<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.799> minute<00:02:25.010> and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that that creates in just a minute and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.550 
that that creates in just a minute and
now<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.359> you've<00:02:26.510> done<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.930> first<00:02:27.230> row<00:02:27.530> of

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
now that you've done the first row of

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.580 
now that you've done the first row of
the<00:02:27.799> pattern<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:29.209> will<00:02:29.389> turn<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:29.989> work<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
you will purl across these stitches so

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.160 
you will purl across these stitches so
there<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.459> going<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:34.879> be<00:02:34.939> a<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.420> side<00:02:35.780> what

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
there is going to be a right side what

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.220 
there is going to be a right side what
you<00:02:36.349> just<00:02:36.650> did<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.219> a<00:02:37.819> wrong<00:02:38.239> side<00:02:38.269> which
