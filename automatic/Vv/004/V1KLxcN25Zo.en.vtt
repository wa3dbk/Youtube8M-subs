tour or something like that and so what
I<00:05:13.780> did<00:05:13.990> here<00:05:14.350> was<00:05:14.500> I<00:05:14.920> put<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.780> button<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:17.110> allow

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
I did here was I put a button to allow

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.820 
I did here was I put a button to allow
you<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.740> turn<00:05:18.370> off<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:19.600> audio<00:05:20.230> for<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.530> menu

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
you to turn off the audio for the menu

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.550 
you to turn off the audio for the menu
so<00:05:21.040> that's<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.370> kind<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.670> a<00:05:21.760> preference<00:05:22.120> setting

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
so that's a kind of a preference setting

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.260 
so that's a kind of a preference setting
these<00:05:23.560> are<00:05:23.740> more<00:05:23.890> utility<00:05:24.550> things<00:05:24.850> because<00:05:25.240> I

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
these are more utility things because I

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.810
