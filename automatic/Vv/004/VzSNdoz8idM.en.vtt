00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 kaka 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:29.090
 the mayor behrs are all very well 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.070
 Welcome to anyone else there I am rj car 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.410
 bringing you today 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.809
 my first impressions of cof 12 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.449
 multiplayer goals had a 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.519
 very difficult to achieve the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.230
 a personal pre-sale outside the 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.180
 big stores that we know that at 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.790
 sometimes fail to provide the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 game soon as it is released but 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930
 It turned out that the small shop where I 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.000
 usually buy contacted me 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.829
 on Friday afternoon saying 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.500
 you are receiving a shipment of games 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.539
 nor at night around 8 o'clock 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.390
 They called me then the 80 who already 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.160
 I was there with the game in hand and that if I 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.030
 I wanted to spend the catch was already 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.830
 released 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.390
 So I was crazy to play a game. 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.990
 different thing I went there and got the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.729
 game 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 I played a little bit on Friday 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.229
 I also played a lot on Saturday and already 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.640
 gave there pro concludes some things and 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.409
 can be dividing these 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.659
 information with you 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.880
 good first with regard to personal weapons 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.320
 for those who did not like peace cup 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.900
 I was not going to roll anymore 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.720
 kits with the core of goals lie rolls 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.880
 so I already took the four cops there 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 I can not evaluate to you so 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.180
 strong as it was in the black ops two 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.240
 because we are practically playing 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 all the time with beautiful connection has much 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 gringo playing then purple gringo the people 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 has no dedicated server at least for 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.390
 now I do not know if after officially 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.400
 he is released they will not even be 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 providing the dedicated server 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.299
 but for now we only have garbage in 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.520
 to serve people has no dedicated server 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.439
 So you mean the little tiger with the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.299
 connection it gets a little more difficult 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.759
 It is difficult for us to assess whether there is 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.520
 is really strong right or not 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.829
 But it's a risk, yes, I've already died. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.910
 also for suits and muted 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.400
 a shot just then so the idea goes by 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.980
 is that they are perhaps a little strong 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.530
 But we can not finish anything yet. 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.900
 need to still play with enough connection 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.200
 evaluate whether 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.910
 interfering there, let's say 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.400
 the judgment to be able to say to you 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 anything but start time skol 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 and she also signed for killing herself with 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.930
 a shot only when another 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.060
 personal thing that bothered me 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.620
 I think at least until 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.069
 Now all I saw everything I 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.480
 I played that maybe I got more. 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.060
 let us say impressed with the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.010
 maps is the sensation that we have here 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.130
 the maps are much larger than they are 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.510
 usually they are like this if people 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.870
 perhaps observe there in the dimensions in the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.030
 map maybe they are not say no 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 is usually greater than one position 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.799
 but we have some maps where the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.450
 people have several levels several floors 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.220
 so that makes it difficult because 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.799
 basically multiplying the area that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.500
 You have to cover the guys have jacket. 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.569
 Duchy is alright now start 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 There is too much gringo too late so the 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.739
 things get a little more boring than 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.280
 stay a little more difficult like this 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.920
 but I was pretty impressed with the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.900
 of the maps, nor are there any 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.760
 polluted water is not what I mean by 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.220
 it is polluted maps that we have 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.200
 information on a map to process 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.269
 Yeah, and when we have this amount 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.920
 information on the map in order to 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.299
 to be able to process what finishes 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.630
 happening is that we lose attention 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.579
 of a fait and ends up being so say 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.040
 I love that I can tell you 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.290
 surprised all the time the game he 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.269
 It's very fast, that's how people are. 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.400
 I'm playing with the xingu to kill 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.319
 building to die for is easy but we 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.510
 Yes, you can see that the game is 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.540
 very fast believe you're a little 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.090
 faster than the black box it 2 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.859
 so it ends up bothering a little bit 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.930
 because I know that having no server 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.769
 dedicated with garbage not be seeing game much 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.049
 fast 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.450
 the result it tends to not be there much 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.099
 Good, but I'll only be able to evaluate it later. 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.870
 to be playing the Brazilian face with 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.660
 nine full to see how things 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.120
 They work but the game is fast, right? 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.180
 while killing is difficult to die 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.190
 It's easy enough, but polluted maps. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.169
 very big and this is bothering me 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.330
 A little bit is withdrawing a little bit 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.669
 serious because the guy has the maps 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.530
 Sometimes you do not know what you do 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.030
 you arrive it seems like you're in a 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 You have to buy maze 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.900
 everything that is side gets hard on you 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.550
 read the back up in these 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.830
 At least I have conditions. 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.800
 difficulty at least now at the beginning and 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.540
 so it ends up frustrating a little bit 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.630
 I think this is the only point that I 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.620
 I have to speak in the sense that you do not know 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.960
 I did not like 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.540
 so far it really was the maps I 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.760
 did not enjoy the maps I expect a 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.890
 Better connection time is the best time 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.620
 I have a condition 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.600
 Differentiated game Improve things 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 neel being able to read the backup a little 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.770
 better also in this sensation disappear 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.430
 but at first it bothered me most. 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.840
 that 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.850
 another little thing that we unfortunately 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.930
 There is no more a personal pinball to 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.330
 We get an idea of how the 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.700
 our connection was not that this was a 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.830
 measurement needs a lot of our condition 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.540
 but at least to help people to 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.550
 have some idea of ​​what was 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.950
 happening and we do not have it anymore 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.780
 there is no boy at least until now 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.280
 We 're not getting any 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.500
 tool to let us know 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.970
 exactly how our connection is in 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.710
 something else also with many people found 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.450
 that no longer existed only the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.370
 team continues to exist 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.860
 He has also stabbed me in the 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.600
 fright in this mechanic other than the stab 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.430
 did not leave with the peniche naify 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.990
 cease to exist 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.430
 That's good folks, I hope you guys 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.550
 Did you like the phone is ringing? 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.330
 and he sees himself in the next fox game play 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.330
 that tomorrow
