unfortunately<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> downfall<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
unfortunately this is the downfall it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
unfortunately this is the downfall it
does<00:01:09.570> only<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.260> star<00:01:10.530> skills<00:01:10.950> now

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
does only have two star skills now

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550

surely<00:01:12.000> EA<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> play<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.260> sort<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
surely EA a play with that sort of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.140 
surely EA a play with that sort of
dribbling<00:01:13.950> agency<00:01:14.490> should<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.119> least

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
dribbling agency should have at least

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
dribbling agency should have at least
three<00:01:15.630> skills<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> didn't<00:01:17.880> really

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
three skills not to but it didn't really

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
three skills not to but it didn't really
hinder<00:01:18.420> him<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.259> his<00:01:19.380> dribbling

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hinder him that much in his dribbling

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
hinder him that much in his dribbling
game<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> few<00:01:20.310> ball<00:01:20.549> rolls<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
game a few ball rolls here in the can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
game a few ball rolls here in the can
still<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.590> damage<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.220> dribbling<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.240> he

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
still do some damage in dribbling and he

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.390 
still do some damage in dribbling and he
does<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.750> 82<00:01:25.259> strength<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> great

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
does have is 82 strength which is great

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
does have is 82 strength which is great
so<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.970> fend<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:27.479> defenders<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.619> he's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
so we can fend off defenders when he's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
so we can fend off defenders when he's
on<00:01:28.890> his<00:01:28.979> wrongs<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> dribbles<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.540> was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
on his wrongs and dribbles now he was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690
