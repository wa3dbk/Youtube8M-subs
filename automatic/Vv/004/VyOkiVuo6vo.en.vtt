00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.490
 unless that would leave not bad 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.760
 hello hello 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.850
 down 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.190
 mike the rear tires of the new one 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.840
 aventador roadster are the most monstrous 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.600
 from the dimensional point of view of 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.730
 any mass-produced car 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.500
 but the aventador roster is the most spider 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.590
 excessive from a stylistic point of view 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 from the performance point of view 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.699
 of the sensations that from the hackathons of the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.190
 price since it costs over 360 thousand 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.050
 euro to buy them in europe is crazy 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.970
 however this car is made to do 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.710
 go crazy Chinese Russian Americans who 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.960
 are the markets had to borghini sta 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.089
 going strong for the truth would be 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.379
 even crazy to take her to the track at 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.839
 lamborghini asked us to do it e 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.489
 so we have all the racetrack of 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.570
 host near miami at our disposal 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.570
 so let's try 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.420
 the square line as much as that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 of the coupe and plays on the motif 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.930
 the hexagon geometric however the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 bodywork is slightly lower and of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.890
 consequently even more aggressive the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.079
 roof made up of two very light buses 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.909
 in carbon composite it is assembled and yes 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.380
 dismount in two or three minutes e 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.329
 when the two elements are disassembled 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.039
 they go to saturate the front trunk 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.100
 while there is no space behind the seats 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.750
 not even for mobile bags in his 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.549
 temperament does something to invite to 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 a relaxing wide-ranging 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.409
 the engine is at the same overflowing 6.5 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 liters of 700 horses to which, however, they are 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.890
 the start stop and the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.420
 system that alternately turns off a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.429
 of the two rows of cylinders when the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.959
 just power demand 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.030
 but this attention to consumption and to 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.009
 visions and the only concession in the world 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.080
 real route because for the rest it is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.060
 brutal in delivering to a shade 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.159
 mechanics that make one shudder and to a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.659
 traditional electro gearbox implemented that 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.250
 from the big repercussions when 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.409
 drives aggressively and is rough 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.030
 to pleasure sailing 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.590
 permanent all - wheel drive with 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.660
 haldex central joint to control 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.340
 electronic that stops remaining the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
 variable distribution between the axes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.819
 according to the quota it maintains at 70 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.609
 percent of the torque on the wheels 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.380
 rear in road mode and 90 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.900
 percent in sports to guarantee 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.030
 fun and over lost while in the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.100
 running solution steps back to 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.870
 a 80 percent balance behind and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.519
 20 percent ahead that lambo it 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.260
 considers it optimal to have the maximum 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.260
 yield in terms of lap times 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.799
 the aventador roadster certainly can't 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.569
 be called an easy car e 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.310
 accommodating and precisely for this in 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.230
 terms of road effectiveness can 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.299
 could even give up something to some 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 more easily manageable opponent but 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.930
 his goal is to provoke 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.639
 great adrenaline rushes both 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.560
 look you know that you followed it and in 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.560
 this sense really has no competitors
