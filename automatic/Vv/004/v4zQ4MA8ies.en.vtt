going to be showing you how to get fast
and<00:00:13.320> free<00:00:13.799> fire-making<00:00:14.400> XP<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and free fire-making XP so I'm going to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.369 
and free fire-making XP so I'm going to
first<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> all<00:00:15.540> show<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> method<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.260> then

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
first of all show the method and then

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.779 
first of all show the method and then
I'm<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> explain<00:00:16.890> after<00:00:17.400> when<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
I'm going to explain after when you

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.130 
I'm going to explain after when you
should<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.449> method<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
should use this method that when you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.269 
should use this method that when you
shouldn't<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:19.949> basic

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
shouldn't so just some basic

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.599 
shouldn't so just some basic
efficiencies<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.230> method<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.369> um

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
efficiencies with this method so um

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.800 
efficiencies with this method so um
there's<00:00:24.000> another<00:00:24.150> thing<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> should<00:00:24.570> move

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
there's another thing you should move

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.150 
there's another thing you should move
your<00:00:24.869> tinder<00:00:25.170> box<00:00:25.439> down<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> middle<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
your tinder box down to the middle of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.589 
your tinder box down to the middle of
your<00:00:26.279> inventory<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> have

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
your inventory and that way you have

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
your inventory and that way you have
less<00:00:27.840> distance<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> click<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.340> each<00:00:29.460> log

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
less distance to click to each log

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
less distance to click to each log
rather<00:00:30.330> than<00:00:30.390> having<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> first<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
rather than having it the first the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.720 
rather than having it the first the
first<00:00:31.740> position<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.250> between<00:00:32.369> having

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
first position you're in between having

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
first position you're in between having
to<00:00:32.820> drag<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.149> mouse<00:00:33.210> all<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.750> down<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to drag your mouse all the way down and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
to drag your mouse all the way down and
you'll<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> run<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.850> spot<00:00:36.090> just

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you'll see here I run to this spot just

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
you'll see here I run to this spot just
next<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> statute<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.380> able<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.710> get

out pretty much all inventory and when I
reach<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> tree<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.980> sort<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> run

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
reach that tree I just sort of run

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.580 
reach that tree I just sort of run
around<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.820> burn<00:00:42.270> them<00:00:42.450> towards<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
requirements to access it and you'll

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
requirements to access it and you'll
need<00:00:50.070> level<00:00:50.340> 35<00:00:50.820> fire-making<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.840> able<00:00:51.899> to

dropping their logs here on air most

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.549 
dropping their logs here on air most
world's<00:00:57.629> I'd<00:00:57.719> recommend<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> find<00:00:58.289> somebody

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
world's I'd recommend to find somebody

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.990 
world's I'd recommend to find somebody
with<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> dragon<00:00:58.890> axis<00:00:59.340> guy<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.640> has<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> real

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
with a dragon axis guy only has a real

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.959 
with a dragon axis guy only has a real
knack<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.719> slower

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
knack so it's a little bit slower

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.130 
knack so it's a little bit slower
obviously<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> higher<00:01:03.180> woodcutting<00:01:03.600> level<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
obviously a higher woodcutting level and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
obviously a higher woodcutting level and
a<00:01:04.199> better<00:01:04.350> x<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.129> faster<00:01:05.430> XP<00:01:05.610> for

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
a better x is going to be faster XP for

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
a better x is going to be faster XP for
you<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.409> somebody<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:07.830> just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
you so if you see somebody there just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.320 
you so if you see somebody there just
feel<00:01:08.189> free<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> ask<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.030> run

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
feel free to ask them if you can run

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.429 
feel free to ask them if you can run
their<00:01:09.479> teak's<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.049> they're<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
their teak's because they're gonna be

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
their teak's because they're gonna be
having<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> drop<00:01:11.010> every<00:01:11.400> single<00:01:11.760> teak

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
having to drop every single teak

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
having to drop every single teak
individually<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> much<00:01:13.229> faster<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
individually so it's much faster for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.710 
individually so it's much faster for
them<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.580> trade<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> over<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
them to just trade it over to you so

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.859 
them to just trade it over to you so
they<00:01:16.020> should<00:01:16.290> always<00:01:16.619> let<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> it's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
they should always let you do this it's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170 
they should always let you do this it's
also<00:01:19.049> faster<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> tree<00:01:20.850> falls

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
also faster to just when the tree falls

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
also faster to just when the tree falls
is<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> trade<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.409> what

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
is just to trade them and get what

should<00:02:09.569> definitely<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> over<00:02:10.440> this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
should definitely do that over this

should definitely do that over this
method<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.520> method<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> little<00:02:12.270> bit

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
method but this method is a little bit

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.910 
method but this method is a little bit
slower<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.959> offers<00:02:13.379> them<00:02:13.590> for
