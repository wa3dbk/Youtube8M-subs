00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.850
 now good to all and yes as anti 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.980
 true and we're going to talk about the action of 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.890
 urgull and the history of black ops both 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.450
 of the campaign as zombies their relationship 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.880
 as you can see everyone 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.100
 now he is saying that if children 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.500
 two stories are related no 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.710
 it can be me I'm saying this 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 for a very long time and also two 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.810
 things that were obvious and that made 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 reference to this to that relationship between 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.730
 the two stories was precisely 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.190
 when the foundation comes out in the campaign 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.590
 black ops and when the rooting in the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.629
 word where campaign but today we're going to 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.730
 focus on this the az under boom 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.000
 because I was here the is a term of 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.829
 the black ops campaign on the map 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.870
 of kowloon well then if we give ourselves 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.809
 account here in collum what we were 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.790
 doing was going for doctor clark 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.800
 that was the one that had the numbers as the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.590
 doctor of faith not and what did 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.210
 reference to all this mystery of the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.280
 will not follow was not one of the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.770
 scientists who were with all 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.060
 those those secrets and I worked for 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.299
 dragovic 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.630
 and kraft in good color well here 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.250
 hudson is interrogating this man and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.170
 then now when to be able 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.100
 get us the fan of the boom that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.659
 we have to do 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.310
 Well, we have to shoot there 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.990
 the people are we have to kill her 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.759
 we have to throw grenades after 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 have assembled all the tester equipment we 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.630
 let's come here behind and on the radio 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.360
 it is going to open and we are going to take 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.210
 a tape fix that when we the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.759
 we welcome has shaken everything is worth 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.390
 trembling as if it were like 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.399
 when a rocket comes off that 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.159
 roar when a rocket takes off 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.740
 well, that's because we're going 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.170
 to take it, no, and the thunder as 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.869
 I explained in the video of the action of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.299
 boom and the story that is in the list 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.819
 of reproduction is meant the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.940
 thunder boom is a rocket reactor 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.989
 so that's why that tremor is not and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.420
 now it comes from the most important part 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.220
 look now the hudson has that tape 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.560
 here we have to introduce it in another 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.430
 radio in another kind of cassette but 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.130
 where is that case then look when 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.220
 we jump to the other 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.200
 Dr. Clark will take us to a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.990
 secret room that is just behind 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.480
 of this refrigerator you remember 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.270
 when we in transit and in die 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
 we put the arms race in a few 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.520
 refrigerators to be able to remove them later 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.090
 in the other place we keep those 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.580
 weapons we keep but realize 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.160
 here in this room are also 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.290
 the weapons that we have to catch and not 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 there are only those weapons but that is that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.720
 cassette where we have to enter the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 tape and we will give the thunder when 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 we put that tape we listen 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.730
 the numbers those numbers that you 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.480
 always ask me is what 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.000
 mean and right after you start 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.850
 listen to your numbers comes out suddenly the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 thunder from the wall we get in the 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.030
 thunder because all that history of the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.580
 zombie campaign is related and 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.710
 fix as from here of black ops we 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.330
 they put the refrigerator and weapons 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.710
 saved in that room that had 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.380
 behind 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.060
 that in black ops 2 we were going to be able 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.030
 keep weapons within the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.560
 refrigerators total ratio between 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.050
 two campaigns but aside all that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 mystery behind the numbers 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.230
 the gas is not going to 6 and everything the Russians 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.010
 they were planning 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.500
 with that mysterious rocket part of that 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.110
 reactor that was the thunder gum I what 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.590
 I had been saying for a long time and 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.690
 people now start to believe not you 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.590
 you lose the redun and the relationship between 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.480
 campaigns because he appeared there on the beach 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.280
 in guard guard 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.810
 until next I live 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.410
 these are all 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.410
 with its course 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 two
