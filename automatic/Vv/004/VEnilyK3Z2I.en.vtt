00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
sharp and it's much more dangerous than

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.910 
sharp and it's much more dangerous than
the<00:03:00.610> key<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:00.880> obviously<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.870> let's<00:03:02.080> try<00:03:02.739> Nick

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920
