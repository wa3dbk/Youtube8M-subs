solutions<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.560> movie<00:00:13.920> I'll<00:00:14.100> look<00:00:14.280> at<00:00:14.430> the

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
solutions in this movie I'll look at the

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.790 
solutions in this movie I'll look at the
child<00:00:14.790> window<00:00:15.120> class<00:00:15.480> later<00:00:16.170> you'll<00:00:16.500> see<00:00:16.680> how
