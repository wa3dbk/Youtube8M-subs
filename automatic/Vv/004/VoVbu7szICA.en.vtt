00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
this demonstration I'm just gonna use

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:36.840 
this demonstration I'm just gonna use
the<00:01:25.119> smart<00:01:25.360> instruments<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.860> gonna<00:01:36.069> record<00:01:36.429> I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
the smart instruments I'm gonna record I

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.809 
the smart instruments I'm gonna record I
put<00:01:37.509> random<00:01:37.869> beads<00:01:38.080> in<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.409> my<00:01:39.130> iPhone

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
put random beads in here my iPhone

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.359 
put random beads in here my iPhone
the<00:01:40.569> smart<00:01:40.929> charms<00:01:42.720> stop<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:44.039> better<00:01:45.039> care

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
the smart charms stop that better care

the smart charms stop that better care
record

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090 

now<00:01:50.920> that's<00:01:51.159> triggers<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.700> iPhone<00:01:53.100> suppose

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
now that's triggers the iPhone suppose

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.770 
now that's triggers the iPhone suppose
the<00:01:54.280> base<00:01:54.460> plan<00:01:54.700> right<00:01:54.880> now<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.450> let's<00:01:55.569> put<00:01:55.720> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
the base plan right now so let's put the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:10.260 
the base plan right now so let's put the
baseline<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.229> there<00:02:08.250> okay<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.700> recorded

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
baseline in there okay so that recorded

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.650 
baseline in there okay so that recorded
now<00:02:11.700> instantly<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:15.370> my<00:02:15.550> arrange<00:02:15.879> thing<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
now instantly in my arrange thing here I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.949 
now instantly in my arrange thing here I
have<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> smart<00:02:17.590> drums<00:02:18.569> record<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.660> from<00:02:19.780> the

let's<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> smart<00:02:36.450> strings<00:02:36.870> cuz<00:02:37.110> those

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
let's just do a smart strings cuz those

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:48.070 
let's just do a smart strings cuz those
are<00:02:37.380> new<00:02:39.650> forget<00:02:40.650> find<00:02:40.890> him

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.210 

go<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> my<00:02:49.380> arrange<00:02:49.740> window<00:02:51.710> it's<00:02:52.710> gonna<00:02:52.890> cut

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
go to my arrange window it's gonna cut

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.020 
go to my arrange window it's gonna cut
that<00:02:53.400> track

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.660 

oops

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:15.570 

oh<00:03:04.930> well<00:03:06.850> smart<00:03:07.850> strings<00:03:08.210> again<00:03:13.180> back<00:03:14.180> here

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
oh well smart strings again back here

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:25.320 
oh well smart strings again back here
hit<00:03:16.580> record

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:41.400 

Otto<00:03:26.330> Python

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.110 

so<00:03:42.410> that's<00:03:42.620> record<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.610> string<00:03:43.880> section

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
so that's record in the string section

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.110 
so that's record in the string section
to<00:03:46.239> my<00:03:47.239> song<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.580> what<00:03:49.700> back<00:03:49.850> in<00:03:49.880> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
on my iPhone I didn't delete the most

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.360 
on my iPhone I didn't delete the most
gonna<00:04:03.170> delete<00:04:03.410> them<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:04.160> for<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
gonna delete them but just for the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.400 
gonna delete them but just for the
demonstration<00:04:05.000> purpose<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.720> was<00:04:06.170> pretty

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
demonstration purpose it was pretty

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.750 
demonstration purpose it was pretty
quick<00:04:08.799> but<00:04:09.799> they're<00:04:09.950> muted<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:10.400> didn't<00:04:10.579> really

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
quick but they're muted so didn't really

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.170

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
matter

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.550 
matter
and<00:04:11.390> now<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> have<00:04:17.049> actually<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.140> playing<00:04:18.410> this

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and now I have actually is playing this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.909 
and now I have actually is playing this
one<00:04:18.739> too<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.100> must<00:04:19.280> turn<00:04:19.430> this<00:04:19.549> off<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:21.739> the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
one too so I must turn this off on the

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.280 
one too so I must turn this off on the
phone<00:04:22.130> I'm<00:04:22.340> gonna<00:04:22.460> leave<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.729> session<00:04:23.740> done

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
phone I'm gonna leave the session done

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.650 
phone I'm gonna leave the session done
and<00:04:27.290> then

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.990 

it's<00:04:31.380> gonna<00:04:31.500> optimize<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.340> performance<00:04:32.460> of

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
it's gonna optimize the performance of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:56.050 
it's gonna optimize the performance of
course<00:04:53.330> bars<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.810> quick<00:04:55.050> little

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
course bars that just a quick little

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.970 
course bars that just a quick little
first<00:04:57.060> look<00:04:57.270> at<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.510> Bluetooth<00:04:57.980> connection
