hidden chest has a lot of and how can I
put<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.540> they<00:02:31.989> have<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> lot<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.410> explosions

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
put it they have a lot of explosions

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.759 
put it they have a lot of explosions
that<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.910> around<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.629> is<00:02:34.989> all<00:02:35.200> white<00:02:35.410> or

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
that go around there it is all white or

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.280 
that go around there it is all white or
put<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.190> likes<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.700> redstone<00:02:37.239> i<00:02:37.750> believe<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
put the likes of redstone i believe the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.380 
put the likes of redstone i believe the
dispensers<00:02:38.950> hold<00:02:39.250> arrows<00:02:39.700> they<00:02:39.940> will<00:02:40.120> shoot

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
dispensers hold arrows they will shoot

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.539 
dispensers hold arrows they will shoot
at<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.349> get<00:02:41.500> trapped<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.220> fall

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
at you you can get trapped you can fall

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.789 
at you you can get trapped you can fall
so<00:02:42.819> it's<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.110> said<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> puzzle

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
so it's more of it like I said a puzzle

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.770 
so it's more of it like I said a puzzle
thing<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.489> definitely<00:02:45.700> wears<00:02:46.180> something<00:02:46.540> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
thing it's definitely wears something to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.690 
thing it's definitely wears something to
mess<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.560> hopefully<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
mess around with hopefully the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.970 
mess around with hopefully the
introduction<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.390> trip<00:02:49.780> wires<00:02:50.019> will<00:02:50.440> be<00:02:50.470> added

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
introduction of trip wires will be added

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470 
introduction of trip wires will be added
because<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.310> believe<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.849> all<00:02:52.060> done<00:02:52.329> with

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
because I believe it's all done with

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.360 
because I believe it's all done with
trip<00:02:52.750> wires<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.620> do<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.040> jungle

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
trip wires so if we do see jungle

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.190 
trip wires so if we do see jungle
temples<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.940> should<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.269> TV<00:02:55.599> set<00:02:55.750> ninety

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
temples we should a TV set ninety

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440 
temples we should a TV set ninety
percent<00:02:56.459> see<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.610> likes<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.970> trip<00:02:58.209> wires

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
