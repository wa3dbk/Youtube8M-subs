it's<00:02:50.489> very<00:02:50.670> very<00:02:50.940> cool<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.420> what<00:02:51.540> happens

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it's very very cool and what happens

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.420 
it's very very cool and what happens
once<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:52.200> clicks<00:02:52.500> down<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.860> zero<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> mean<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
once this clicks down to zero I mean it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.150 
once this clicks down to zero I mean it
is<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> minute<00:02:54.420> accurate<00:02:54.959> once<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.950> clicks

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
is to the minute accurate once it clicks

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.960 
is to the minute accurate once it clicks
down<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.550> zero

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
down to zero

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.550 
down to zero
these<00:02:57.360> lights<00:02:57.600> start<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> flash<00:02:58.260> when<00:02:58.440> it's

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
these lights start to flash when it's

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.620 
these lights start to flash when it's
getting<00:02:58.650> close<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.130> zero<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.610> then<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.360> steps

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
getting close to zero and then it steps

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.410 
getting close to zero and then it steps
down<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.290> next<00:03:01.590> mode<00:03:01.940> which<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.090> good<00:03:03.300> it

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
down to the next mode which is good it

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.840 
down to the next mode which is good it
means<00:03:03.600> you've<00:03:03.750> always<00:03:04.050> got<00:03:04.680> some<00:03:05.310> burn<00:03:05.520> time

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
means you've always got some burn time

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.870 
means you've always got some burn time
left<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.690> example<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.110> using<00:03:07.489> mode<00:03:08.489> 3

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
left so for example I'm using mode 3

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.930 
left so for example I'm using mode 3
here<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.720> says<00:03:09.930> I've<00:03:10.080> got<00:03:10.260> 2<00:03:10.470> hours<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.130> 50

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
here it says I've got 2 hours and 50

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.120 
here it says I've got 2 hours and 50
minutes<00:03:11.970> burn<00:03:12.360> time<00:03:12.660> once<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.709> gets<00:03:13.830> down<00:03:14.100> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
minutes burn time once that gets down to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.580 
minutes burn time once that gets down to
0<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.330> steps<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.170> next<00:03:16.410> mode

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
0 and then steps down to the next mode

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
0 and then steps down to the next mode
and<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.459> get<00:03:17.670> some<00:03:17.850> extra<00:03:17.970> burn<00:03:18.330> time<00:03:19.489> it's<00:03:20.489> very
