00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.339
 very good to all guys welcome a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 and more to the channel I am huelva and well god 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 in this case to a new video today they 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 I bring the review of Griezmann Tiff the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
 letter third report of this player 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.580
 that has come out scarcely a few 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 hours and that really looks 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 that it can be one of the best 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 forward centers of the league bbva before 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 to start with the analysis I wanted you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.840
 propose a challenge I would like to get in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.369
 this video to the 200 likes would be 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 incredible to pass this figure and I think that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 you can me because I know that you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 you can and the truth took a couple of days 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 discouraged with the channel can be seen in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.520
 the videos that is also not going up 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.110
 many videos and really yes that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.120
 I'm a little discouraged then I 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.680
 I would like a lot to explain to 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.210
 video I will share it with your friends 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.219
 we will share it on twitter facebook and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.719
 all social networks and a challenge that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.950
 we can get to 200 next if I 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.199
 we get I'm going to draw a lot of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.699
 50,000 coins that to enter the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.989
 draw of the requirements are to like 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.579
 to the video for a comment and be 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.949
 subscribed to me each one blessed of everything 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.079
 this is going to start with the review I've 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.570
 used of second forward a formation 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 4-3-3 with only number 5 many 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 you will say flight because you use it there if 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.740
 truly 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.780
 it looks like it can be better than 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.759
 forward, I think with your fans 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.490
 and his dribble and turn at the same time as 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.680
 tour I think your best option is the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 second forward also in athletics 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.159
 playing there and somehow for good 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.689
 He peeked a little more into reality and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.509
 that or not going to help a little in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 your letter we can see an 89 rhythm 89 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.329
 Dodge 91 shot and 80 pass also 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.439
 74 of physics although to highlight neither 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.090
 he highlighted it a lot because the others 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.520
 statistics are way above that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 physical they have only 86 on average and to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.959
 the statistics that are in the letter 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.259
 I really should have 86 on average 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.869
 measures 1 76 33 of wrong leg there are four of 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.420
 skins cost me 860 thousand coins but 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.819
 afterwards at a few hours I sold it to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.110
 by 1,000,000 then I do not know very clear 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.010
 the price that there is but that round in 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.260
 French practically 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.510
 the million of the million practically in 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.550
 six games has got me 12 goals and the 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.340
 true is one of the best strikers 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.170
 centers of the league bbva l surrounded by a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.760
 French team except the goalkeeper who 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.920
 it's jon heart that completes me very well 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 with mangala and for me to play 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.220
 the up version is of the best goalkeepers 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.480
 of this game 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.070
 otherwise, there is not much that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.350
 tell what practically all 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.150
 known to highlight that pop vita up and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.730
 the right band we have a nap 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 also new that was called way but I 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 I called him velociraptor because he runs that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 otherwise you flip, there's nothing else 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.700
 to emphasize that he made a team so that 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.560
 is almost alone the i-pod goes and the truth 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.720
 is that little gave the passes and Griezmann 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.400
 it gave magic but it's really worth the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.410
 shame in this charisma is worth paying 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.300
 the price that you have that is practically 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.980
 a million coins yes that is true 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.720
 that later will go down because they are going to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.820
 leave more letters are still in the envelopes 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.440
 for a week I was still going to go down like 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.880
 happened with for example ate in shift that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.400
 at the beginning it cost one million one million 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.050
 and a half and it ended up going down but really 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 worth the price you have 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.610
 let's see 89 rhythm runs a lot 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.140
 yes it is true that it was located in a 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.270
 area of ​​the field to be second forward 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.030
 because once the mcd passed 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.770
 if the rival had mcd he faced 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.840
 the centrals and when he had a central 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.410
 a little more of the touch he was leaving was 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.480
 very very fast this same one runs a lot yes 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.670
 that has 89 pace and really deserves 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.210
 this statistic in jail but 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.740
 dodge points 89 you are going to flip change 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.000
 something in the ball that is scary 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.330
 has four corners that helps a 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.520
 lot to improve that dribble and is that the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.830
 speed that has his dribble together 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.810
 much much game to this man the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.610
 truth runs too much but yes it is 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.620
 true that at the same time running is not the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.210
 typical medium water that runs a lot but 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 bargaining is a little cane 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.510
 west runs and over dribble to is very very 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.330
 he has 89 dribble also 100% 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.210
 justified 91 shot has 91 shooting 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.190
 yes and more has a very very good shot and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.440
 that you will notice with both legs 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.150
 that three of bad leg but I think that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.430
 he deserves five you will see good goals 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.020
 with the right leg and also uses very 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.180
 well the exterior but of quality in 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.210
 power you have nothing to complain about 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.950
 this shot goes very well 80's also pass 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.239
 has 80 of pass 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.849
 yes it is true that as I said 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.910
 previously going to the passes and Griezmann 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.099
 all the magic because yes 100% is combined 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.989
 very well with little worth much used of 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.280
 that combination for a left and you 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.139
 has noticed very quickly in the band 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.410
 left on his left leg and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.240
 he also has the pig bs of the league 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.070
 Turkish that also combines very well with 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.690
 He really liked that 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.280
 appearance of excesses fast and is something that 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.570
 you have to stand out because it's worth it and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.880
 especially if what is bardem efe or 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.860
 well this figure of the second forward 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.770
 it also usually moves very well in those 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.250
 aspects 74 the physicist has the physical 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.479
 very good physicist is no player 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.639
 little boy to which you are going to throw boxes 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.020
 as month and running much always a 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 Once you have a little left over, you are 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.979
 Giovinco floor that also runs motorbike 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.590
 but once you get it on the ground do what 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.780
 same this guy does not this strap you give him 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.490
 to lte and protects you well the ball knows 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.260
 use your little body that you have and all that 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.169
 They are a person who you see there, short and 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.000
 such for nothing is a player that you say what 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.010
 they are going to blow on the ground no no no you do not give 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.900
 to lt and the truth is that it has provoked me 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.750
 occasional penalty or because they throw it 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.950
 and they steal it without arbitrating a 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.750
 missing that is 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.190
 surely they will whistle a fault that would 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.680
 also to highlight your positioning 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.450
 for being very well located and now time 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.610
 to look for him you will always find him 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.130
 his four skills or very good and as 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.720
 I repeat it has five legs for me 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.750
 bad because with both legs has 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.370
 so good shot that you notice a lot like that 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.410
 it really worth this 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.430
 griezmann without any doubt 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.830
 you have to pay a million and a half 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.540
 you have to pay two I recommend it 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.240
 I liked a button I think it's better 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.740
 that Suarez without any doubt yes that is 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.390
 true that they are a great uncle has a great 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.840
 but this man has a shot 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.820
 physical pass and a lot of rhythm and dribble 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.860
 true that's what wins me and this 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.020
 man has won me so nothing else 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.300
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.280
 this is how you already know the challenge of the 200 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.600
 likes it would be incredible to reach that figure 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.310
 and nothing more 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.080
