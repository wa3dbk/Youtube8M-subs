 Yes, and is also steadily I think that I want to make a turn anymore Weekly lobby 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.120
 We will build 37 minutes this week 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.170
 It comes with Perth lights 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:26.890
 It in will continue to introduce the parts to use in the lobby No. 37 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:34.840
 The parts attached this time are left ankle frame and servomotor 135 mm 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:36.110
 It became a left-foot part assembled with seal and No. 36 who provided the part coral used this time 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.790
 It is 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:47.570
 Well then, let's go ahead and assemble it right now 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:52.040
 The stroke and left ankle frame that this assembly put a protective seal on this servo cable 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 There is only a simple process of inserting the servo shaft into 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.129
 a I would also like will do the Papa' It is first this 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.030

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 I think that I would like to carry out that I will insert the shaft of te serve 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.500
 Ease of inserting this d-cut part and this d-cut part in line 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.830
 It is only now 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.430
 Recently I dug a great fast I had already entered 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.230
 win-win and is not You're Yes This becomes ne 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:31.370
 Always this Yes the end Colle The first one 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:35.640
 I'm cutting the seal of Saho cable via machine servo 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.930
 After a long time, don't go wild 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.290
 Yes I have the front and back 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.750
 a 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.570
 Let's put it on the front side Let's do it seriously after a long time. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.860
 Three I'm doing seriously 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.460
 Trouble with Tcha this 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.760
 I'm already troubled 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.760
 Here is stuck over here it's Moteru the is here 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.110
 Yes, also do another scolded how Well then came to an end one 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.110
 Which one is this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 Well who I Te here I am here is thought 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:24.980
 Oh yes some recent lobbies really have a few assembly steps 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.890
 I have cut the other half, maybe there is no more news 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 If there is no sound without a sound, what would it be if you add a star part to the appendix 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.330
 There are places where I would like you to do something like that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:46.420
 But I made it too early and only custom parts 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.940
 It seems to be provided in another issue 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 Maybe you 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.810
 I think people who went to around 55 and assembled will buy after that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.680
 It has finished even your Oh seal tension of the servo cable while saying grumble Nante 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:07.310
 I wearing this time was a very simple process 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.310
