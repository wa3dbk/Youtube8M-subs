00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 today I'm going to talk to you about the smart 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.919
 liner aka the clever eyeliner of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.389
 at sephora so why clever 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.470
 because ergonomic grip 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.119
 so normally very eye liner 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.680
 easy Thursday normally because 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.320
 obviously I test them before doing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.300
 this video is on that size for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.300
 me it works very well but on the other 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.410
 then a small line of eye liner 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.410
 we go to these parks 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.090
 okay so we said we carve the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.720
 coke a problem the thing is hyper 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.540
 convenient 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.300
 hop we do it like that we follow the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.520
 line 2 cl no problem it works from 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.489
 thunder in addition it's a tip I 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 go if you see me felt I'm here 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 I'm a fan we can say a little quiet 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 a lot so everything goes well and of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 the other side generally do not know 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.160
 why I'm racing I say yes yes 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.080
 margin rate too much and there i do 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:19.649
 a bullshit you will see I hope 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.140
 that it's going to make them here sailboats of 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.630
 trait it is weird anyway by 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 report to the other side while good 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.720
 as much to tell you that normally it is this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.250
 eye there that should be problematic but 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 no it's the right that can not for me 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.369
 why I get there on one side no 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.740
 the other one especially the fucking side I do 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.049
 whatever 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.170
 so I often find myself with a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.759
 big line of eyeliner since not ugly 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:56.159
 actually the problem of gp cost if also 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:01.979
 on the other side French who accident 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.039
 hop so cotton rod is removed here 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.600
 accident forget beautiful are the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.899
 two choices are made not as they are 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 sees 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.569
 I can not make a big deal of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 this side and on that side finally good 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.860
 not too too slay I wanted 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.959
 said so you'll see but in real life 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.940
 pass I could thicken that one 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.920
 still now we will do me the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.450
 beautiful mouth you see I had him screaming 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.880
 easy with this new tool 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.470
 we go there so we follow the bad 2 by the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 lower eyelid and we make the beautiful 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 mouth 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:57.660
 easy verjux ok on the other side - the one 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:03:02.590
 here I am I am the moment but I 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.510
 am frankly easy comma one is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.230
 happy about the same of the two 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.890
 sides pretty much so everything is fine 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.440
 while thinking of so many of you but 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.900
 line like this like that with writing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.270
 the small blind sephora 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.760
 so I find it pretty cool because 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.080
 it is true that the grip bah it 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 what does it mean to follow our 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.700
 d'oissel it's simple finally 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.560
 even if I do not have it if it's comfortable to 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.660
 the long date like that like 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.910
 captain hook I do not know but 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.800
 I liked it all the same except that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.020
 this is my problem brother is that of a 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.040
 side I get there very well like that 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.989
 there mayfile ouf month say it the one 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.860
 here I would like to make broad strokes 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.959
 so maybe with a little 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.820
 drive it will work again 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.080
 better and for the moment little big 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.440
 traits here and there and now goes to 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.440
 you play
