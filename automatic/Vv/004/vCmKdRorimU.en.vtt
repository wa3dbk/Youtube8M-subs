00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.170
 greet dear friends in touch makeup 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 optimists today we have a small 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.250
 podcast in which I want to answer 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 one question that's me for the last 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 time was set several times and different 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 people the question seemed to me very 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.850
 he sounds interesting so what do you think 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.920
 opinion the biggest problem of the game world 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.390
 of tanks or what most don't you 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.810
 like what you want most 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 to change 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.780
 I really thought so much that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.360
 there is good in our game definitely 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 otherwise we would not play but problems too 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
 there are quite a few of them and I tried for a long time 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.200
 highlight some very global 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.570
 that would overlap everything else or 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 maybe even happened as if it happened 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 would even serve as the first source 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 all the problems are now well, I thought and thought 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 and in the end I came to this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.170
 disappointing conclusion that the main 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.149
 the problem of the game world of tanks is the players 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.970
 because all other problems they are 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.189
 in a big way well, they don’t 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.409
 global character that is it well not 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 very good some cards yes they are 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.580
 there is not very good but there are good 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.930
 on the other hand that is 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.450
 getting that on bad cards is pretty 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
 Rarely is the problem of unsuccessful 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.530
 cards are usually in the fact that they are not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.229
 what colors match five? 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.820
 the players are all limited by the problem is that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.520
 some tanks 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.009
 strongly perry apana or vice versa pinner 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.280
 the Finns yes how let's say perry the opponent 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.930
 same t57 heavy permethrin mouse yes that is y 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
 us nobody nerfili but he himself 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 just cups slag the same problem there 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.310
 definitely but i don't know i don't play either 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.579
 fifty seventh not on 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.829
 on the mouse so for me it's like 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.149
 I see mouse kill see T57 well be 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 afraid a little more that is it is not 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.710
 The problem is such a trifle as you really 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.659
 little thing here if somebody is yoke there on 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.430
 fifty-seventh tone on health i'm not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 against how would you let it go and bend 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 that you don't care how well you play 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 yes technology a little imbo but guys 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 players is really a problem here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 as if difficult to find what has been found now 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.140
 the root cause is just one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.220
 personal it seems to me here I was watching 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.680
 become a recent developer response 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 all sorts of interviews with them and so on there 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.870
 indirectly this problem was touched upon. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.480
 they themselves are dissatisfied with the general skill of the players 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.480
 there is here the average player is 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.870
 very weak player that is a player who 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.360
 knows absolutely nothing about the game he doesn't 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.019
 knows the basic mechanics that is there for 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.180
 light there physics where you can go where 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.000
 you can’t shoot ahead 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.239
 without knowing it he does not know what is 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.829
 armor and how to use that if so what 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.410
 there is such a thing as a given 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.630
 understood the developers said in that 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 stream in some way that no one knows what 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.010
 is the reduced armor that is what 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.590
 roughly speaking 100 millimeters under good 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.260
 angle is better through the stance that 130 under 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.630
 direct they do not know it that is nobody 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.660
 it did not explain and 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.670
 in this course there is such a negative 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.980
 the merit of the game itself because well bye 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.500
 learning in the game none of the bad is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.750
 explained enough if the person is not 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.799
 looks guides no read there 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.720
 forum then 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.060
 well, while he is not interested with you 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.380
 the history of tank building then for him this 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.359
 naturally everything is not obvious for this reason 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.870
 most players will remove it very 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.540
 weak I honestly was shocked when 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.880
 I learned that people do not know what the game is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.310
 settings that can go change 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.840
 let's say the health mapping is there to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 differently displayed to instead 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.420
 nickname was displayed tank because they 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.380
 I do not know let's say they go to IS-7 yes 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.510
 there on some 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 this 9 can't get him anywhere and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.590
 merge then there well they just don't 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.110
 knew that this is IS-7 because he is there 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.360
 hid behind the hill well, that is, behind the stone 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.000
 silhouette is not visible and in above it 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.810
 tank instead of the inscription is-7 there is an inscription 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.439
 nagibator 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.750
 66 owner's nickname yes all that is, as 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.239
 I understand what you think it is 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.579
 some idiot yes but this is reality 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.690
 there is that is just 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.500
 The main problem is that I speak a lot 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.810
 such a large mass of players they 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.900
 just don't know how to play this game 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:33.360
 here probably need to put it that way 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.550
 this thesis and what gvg does for it 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.650
 Well, by and large, now gone 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.780
 some kind of progress here before they 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.150
 tried this guide and do on the main 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.190
 channel well on whom exactly tank 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.950
 Yes, and publish on the site but these guides 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.830
 it was still very small and they went out 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.560
 there once a month shorter for one tank and 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.060
 the weather they did not do here now they 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.710
 will create a second channel on which 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.409
 there will be nuts at home 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.880
 famous water makers to everyones but it 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.340
 also will not solve the problem because 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.030
 youtube as practice shows 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.460
 very little 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.969
 Now if someone thinks that all the players 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.880
 Look there there are guides of Jova Murazor in this 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.310
 or something else 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.650
 or there but then they are very wrong 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.980
 A small percentage of players look at all 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.990
 some guides because no one 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.890
 explains to these players that in order 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.200
 to play normally you need to learn it 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.170
 do need to absorb new information 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.880
 getting her to learn something yes that is 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.010
 nobody knows they think that 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 you need to download for this tank just 10 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.430
 level and everything will come that is 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.160
 you understand what's the matter, it's very sad 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.950
 and much into real problems precisely from 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.370
 this is where the dominance of the art was 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.030
 after all 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.740
 the fact that there was a lot of art this problem is well in 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.240
 the greater degree of the fact that there are many players 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.460
 on not played but because they were looking 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.920
 easy gameplay the same with the rituals 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.840
 now because it's easier to play them 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.880
 they don't need to know how to tank them 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.310
 no need to know how to take positions you 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.310
 got up there at the base and shoot everything 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.550
 there is much easier to play this 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.140
 the main problem is that the main 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.170
 bathert let's think of it from the game 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.260
 when there are when let's say there are not many 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.270
 I know you're dragging dragging and dragging and all 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.800
 merge yes, that is, no 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.620
 just because people don't know how 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.390
 play with you out of luck in your team 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.600
 got a lot more 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.100
 experienced players are extremely inexperienced and they 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.020
 I just do not know what to do and does not twist 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.910
 towers shoots a mask at the enemy 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.860
 their mother you can understand something 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.540
 you can do anything out of your skin 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.760
 climb and shoot us there 6 thousand damage 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.370
 I do not know there at the eighth level from the side 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.010
 merge because the team game into one 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.170
 helmet dragged well, it is necessary either hellish 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.930
 some kind of skill completely insane there 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.520
 either a platoon of the same skill or to 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.110
 very lucky because well there 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.640
 there will not be enough elemental shells 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.430
 kill or if it will lead wildly all 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.710
 equally not praise that is such here 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:04.340
 moments they are of course very password 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.320
 annoying so personally I think 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.750
 that this is probably the biggest problem 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.240
 and 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.420
 so far unfortunately she does not dare here 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.790
 I don't see any big sleep 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.740
 such here with the movements that is something 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.930
 that is really changing for now 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.350
 it remains that I hope I answered 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.720
 this question if not then specify in 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.220
 comments I will try to answer there well 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.390
 Of course, don't forget to subscribe to 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.229
