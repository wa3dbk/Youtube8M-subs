go now you can see that the Galaxy s3 is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.920 
go now you can see that the Galaxy s3 is
showing<00:00:37.320> us<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> screen<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.600> now<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.660> see

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
showing us the screen first now we see

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.580 
showing us the screen first now we see
it<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> HTC<00:00:40.530> One<00:00:40.739> X<00:00:42.020> keep<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.170> mind<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it on the HTC One X keep in mind that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
it on the HTC One X keep in mind that
the<00:00:43.770> HTC<00:00:44.100> One<00:00:44.430> X<00:00:44.700> doesn't<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.480> fast-food

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the HTC One X doesn't have fast-food

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.750 
the HTC One X doesn't have fast-food
enabled<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.649> could<00:00:46.890> enable<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> options

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
enabled you could enable on the options

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
enabled you could enable on the options
and<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> lot<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:48.930> faster

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and it would make a lot of a lot faster

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
and it would make a lot of a lot faster
but<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> doesn't<00:00:50.670> come<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.969> factory

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
but because it doesn't come as factory

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
but because it doesn't come as factory
default<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.030> we'll

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
default I'm not gonna do that and we'll

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.369 
default I'm not gonna do that and we'll
go<00:00:54.120> ahead<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.300> wait<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.230> which

go ahead and wait and see you know which

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
go ahead and wait and see you know which
one<00:00:55.530> turns<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> first<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:57.149> while<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.539> guys

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
one turns on first now while these guys

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.700 
one turns on first now while these guys
are<00:00:57.780> loading<00:00:58.109> I'll<00:00:58.199> let<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> guys<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
they're running on the same Wi-Fi
network<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> galaxy<00:01:01.680> s3<00:01:01.800> did

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
network so we see that the galaxy s3 did

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.399 
network so we see that the galaxy s3 did
load<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> lock<00:01:03.210> screen<00:01:03.449> first<00:01:03.750> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
speed comparison as well so those are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
speed comparison as well so those are
both<00:01:12.630> cleaned<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> nice

screen is pretty much the same nothing
running<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.490> let's<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.850> ahead

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
running the back down so let's go ahead

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.460 
running the back down so let's go ahead
and<00:01:36.090> start<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.390> first<00:01:36.689> application<00:01:36.869> speed

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and start our first application speed

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.990 
and start our first application speed
test<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.890> it'll<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> Google<00:01:38.579> Earth

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
test and it'll be Google Earth

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
test and it'll be Google Earth
so<00:01:39.240> I'll<00:01:39.329> tapping<00:01:39.659> about<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> same<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.409> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so I'll tapping about the same time so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.200 
so I'll tapping about the same time so
one<00:01:41.340> two<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.579> looks<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:48.000> load

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
one two three and looks like they load

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
one two three and looks like they load
it<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.420> pretty<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.079> exactly<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> same<00:01:49.740> time

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it up pretty much exactly the same time

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.499 
it up pretty much exactly the same time
I'm<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.159> call<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.670> tie<00:01:50.729> because

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I'm gonna call that one a tie because

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.420 
I'm gonna call that one a tie because
honestly<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.710> too<00:01:52.770> close<00:01:52.979> we'll<00:01:53.250> see

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
honestly it was way too close we'll see

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.340 
honestly it was way too close we'll see
which<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.270> populates<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> 3d

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
which one actually populates the 3d

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.149 
which one actually populates the 3d
buildings<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.740> it's

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
buildings first and now you can see it's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.639 
buildings first and now you can see it's
the<00:01:59.280> galaxy<00:01:59.640> s3<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.060> case<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.500> win

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the galaxy s3 in this case so the win

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
the galaxy s3 in this case so the win
goes<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> galaxy<00:02:02.399> s3<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.030> did<00:02:03.210> our

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
goes to the galaxy s3 because it did our

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
goes to the galaxy s3 because it did our
it<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> loading<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.530> these<00:02:04.740> 3d<00:02:05.130> buildings<00:02:05.490> in

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it is loading up these 3d buildings in

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
it is loading up these 3d buildings in
Las<00:02:05.790> Vegas<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.899> bit<00:02:06.990> faster<00:02:07.409> than<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
Las Vegas a little bit faster than the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.190 
Las Vegas a little bit faster than the
one<00:02:08.429> X<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> we'll<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.239> ahead<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.959> out

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
one X is so we'll go ahead and back out

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.979 
one X is so we'll go ahead and back out
of<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.370> let's<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.390> ahead<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
of here and let's go ahead and go to the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
of here and let's go ahead and go to the
next<00:02:13.140> application

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
next application

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.640 
next application
which<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.910> dictionary<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.140> two

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
which is the dictionary up so one two

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.240 
which is the dictionary up so one two
three

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.340 

pretty<00:02:20.970> much<00:02:21.150> again<00:02:21.570> at<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.750> same<00:02:21.870> time<00:02:22.140> maybe

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
pretty much again at the same time maybe

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.020 
pretty much again at the same time maybe
a<00:02:22.470> split<00:02:22.770> second<00:02:23.100> faster<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> galaxy<00:02:23.910> s3

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
a split second faster on the galaxy s3

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.820 
a split second faster on the galaxy s3
both<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.110> guys<00:02:25.260> are<00:02:25.410> running<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> same

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
both of these guys are running the same

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
both of these guys are running the same
processor<00:02:26.190> which<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> 1.5<00:02:27.000> bigger

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
processor which is the 1.5 bigger

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.170 
processor which is the 1.5 bigger
dual-core<00:02:28.170> Snapdragon<00:02:28.920> s4<00:02:29.040> processor<00:02:29.580> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.630 
dual-core Snapdragon s4 processor so
it's<00:02:30.600> kind<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> expected<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.100> galaxy<00:02:32.430> s3

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
it's kind of expected but the galaxy s3

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
it's kind of expected but the galaxy s3
does<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> gig<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.290> h2<00:02:34.590> 1x<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:34.980> 2

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
does have a gig up on the h2 1x at 2

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
does have a gig up on the h2 1x at 2
gigs<00:02:35.400> versus<00:02:35.940> one<00:02:36.090> gig<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.480> let's<00:02:36.600> go<00:02:36.660> ahead

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
gigs versus one gig so let's go ahead

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.230 
gigs versus one gig so let's go ahead
and<00:02:36.870> look<00:02:36.960> up<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.710> word<00:02:38.390> dog<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.959> dog<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.240> I

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
and look up the word dog so dog and I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.490 
and look up the word dog so dog and I
will<00:02:42.390> hit<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> search<00:02:42.810> button<00:02:42.840> at<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.320> same

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
will hit the search button at the same

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.940 
will hit the search button at the same
time<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.610> 1<00:02:44.940> 2<00:02:45.860> 3<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:48.800> pretty<00:02:49.800> much

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
time if I can so 1 2 3 and pretty much

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.470 
time if I can so 1 2 3 and pretty much
the<00:02:50.040> same<00:02:50.130> time<00:02:50.340> again<00:02:50.580> maybe<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.880> split<00:02:51.180> second

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the same time again maybe a split second

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320 
the same time again maybe a split second
faster<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> galaxy<00:02:52.320> s3<00:02:53.090> go<00:02:54.090> ahead<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
faster on the galaxy s3 go ahead and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.760 
faster on the galaxy s3 go ahead and
back<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.750> now<00:02:54.810> keeping<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.320> apps<00:02:55.470> up

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
back on it right now keeping the apps up

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.949 
back on it right now keeping the apps up
open<00:02:56.580> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> background<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.450> we're

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
open in the background because we're

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.540 
open in the background because we're
both<00:02:58.080> running<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:58.980> both<00:02:59.190> these<00:02:59.310> phones

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
both running are these both these phones

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.430 
both running are these both these phones
are<00:02:59.640> running<00:02:59.850> Android<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.989> really<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.380> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
are running Android and I really want to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.660 
are running Android and I really want to
give<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.650> true<00:03:01.860> experience<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.400> us<00:03:02.489> which

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
give you a true experience for us which

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.280 
give you a true experience for us which
phone's<00:03:02.940> gonna<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.180> faster<00:03:03.630> obviously<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
phone's gonna be faster obviously the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.350 
phone's gonna be faster obviously the
actually<00:03:04.530> gig<00:03:04.709> might<00:03:04.980> give<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.520> galaxy<00:03:05.880> s3<00:03:06.150> an

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
actually gig might give the galaxy s3 an

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120 
actually gig might give the galaxy s3 an
advantage<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.080> we'll<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.680> ahead<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.010> on

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
advantage but we'll go ahead and go on

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.920 
advantage but we'll go ahead and go on
to<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> next<00:03:08.520> test<00:03:08.700> which<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.970> Flixter<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.870> I'm

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to the next test which is Flixter so I'm

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.270 
to the next test which is Flixter so I'm
gonna<00:03:10.050> tap<00:03:10.170> these<00:03:10.290> guys<00:03:10.440> at<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.590> same<00:03:10.739> time<00:03:10.950> 1

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
gonna tap these guys at the same time 1

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.880 
gonna tap these guys at the same time 1
2<00:03:11.550> 3<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.690> pretty<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.110> tie<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.650> go

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
2 3 that was pretty much a tie so go

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.560 
2 3 that was pretty much a tie so go
ahead<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.160> back<00:03:17.310> out<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.550> here<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.030> let's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
ahead and back out of here and let's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.620 
ahead and back out of here and let's
load<00:03:18.750> up<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.170> Play<00:03:19.500> Store<00:03:19.799> 1<00:03:20.160> 2<00:03:20.430> 3<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:23.630> little

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
load up the Play Store 1 2 3 a little

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.509 
load up the Play Store 1 2 3 a little
bit<00:03:24.840> faster<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> galaxy<00:03:25.739> s3<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.280> case

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
bit faster on the galaxy s3 in this case

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.340 
bit faster on the galaxy s3 in this case
let's<00:03:27.030> go<00:03:27.180> ahead<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.690> load<00:03:28.170> up<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
let's go ahead and load up the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.080 
let's go ahead and load up the
calculator<00:03:28.769> not<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> calculators<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
calculator not the calculators it's the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.759 
calculator not the calculators it's the
Samsung<00:03:30.299> calculator<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:30.989> HTC<00:03:31.290> calculator

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
Samsung calculator is the HTC calculator

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.470 
Samsung calculator is the HTC calculator
so<00:03:31.950> keep<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.280> mind<00:03:32.400> they're<00:03:33.209> not<00:03:33.239> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
so keep that in mind they're not the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.970 
so keep that in mind they're not the
same<00:03:33.690> app<00:03:33.870> unlike<00:03:34.320> these<00:03:34.470> other<00:03:34.530> ones<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.950> have

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
same app unlike these other ones I have

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.550 
same app unlike these other ones I have
tested<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.610> 1<00:03:36.060> 2<00:03:36.390> 3<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:38.280> case<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.760> HTC

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
tested so 1 2 3 this case the HTC

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.259 
tested so 1 2 3 this case the HTC
application<00:03:40.560> opened<00:03:41.070> up<00:03:41.130> first<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.000> when

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
application opened up first so that when

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.759 
application opened up first so that when
X<00:03:42.450> got<00:03:42.630> its<00:03:42.780> first<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.320> app<00:03:43.470> speed

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
X got its first one in the app speed

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.030 
X got its first one in the app speed
test<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.519> open<00:03:44.730> up<00:03:44.820> Google<00:03:45.239> Maps<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.750> 1<00:03:45.959> 2<00:03:46.350> 3

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.550 

about<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.280> same<00:03:50.519> there<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.180> back<00:03:51.930> out<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.230> here

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
about the same there so back out of here

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.110 
about the same there so back out of here
now<00:03:52.860> let's<00:03:53.010> go<00:03:53.070> ahead<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.340> run<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.610> quadrant

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
now let's go ahead and run a quadrant

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.340 
now let's go ahead and run a quadrant
standard<00:03:54.209> benchmark<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:54.900> I'm<00:03:54.959> go<00:03:55.110> ahead<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
standard benchmark so I'm go ahead and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350 
standard benchmark so I'm go ahead and
close<00:03:55.980> out<00:03:56.190> these<00:03:56.430> applications<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
close out these applications for the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.300 
close out these applications for the
benchmark<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.140> way<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.890> know<00:03:59.010> we<00:03:59.160> get

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
benchmark so that way you know we get

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.820 
benchmark so that way you know we get
you<00:03:59.640> know<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.760> nice<00:03:59.970> fair<00:04:00.630> benchmark<00:04:01.200> we'll<00:04:01.739> go

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
you know a nice fair benchmark we'll go

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.289 
you know a nice fair benchmark we'll go
ahead<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:01.980> close<00:04:02.250> them<00:04:02.459> out<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.790> here<00:04:03.060> like

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
ahead and close them out of here like

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.229 
ahead and close them out of here like
that<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.320> will<00:04:04.440> run<00:04:04.590> quadrant<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.280> I'll

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
that and that will run quadrant and I'll

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.240 
that and that will run quadrant and I'll
just<00:04:06.570> basically<00:04:07.019> skip<00:04:07.860> through<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.130> whole

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
just basically skip through the whole

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.530 
just basically skip through the whole
process<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.700> lot<00:04:08.880> way<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.060> guys<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.360> see<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
process a lot way you guys can see the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.790 
process a lot way you guys can see the
score<00:04:09.810> so

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.650 

okay<00:04:15.370> so<00:04:15.430> both<00:04:15.850> our<00:04:16.090> Don's<00:04:16.390> hit<00:04:16.660> yes<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:18.660> you

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
okay so both our Don's hit yes and you

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.750 
okay so both our Don's hit yes and you
can<00:04:19.780> see<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.200> result<00:04:20.890> we<00:04:20.980> got<00:04:21.100> on<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> Samsung

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
can see the result we got on the Samsung

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.820 
can see the result we got on the Samsung
Galaxy<00:04:21.790> s3<00:04:22.180> was<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:23.220> 49:22<00:04:24.690> 4920<00:04:25.690> -<00:04:25.870> really<00:04:26.710> good

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
Galaxy s3 was a 49:22 4920 - really good

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.780 
Galaxy s3 was a 49:22 4920 - really good
score<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.360> One<00:04:28.630> X<00:04:28.810> we<00:04:29.110> got<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.790> forty

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
score and on the One X we got a forty

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.820 
score and on the One X we got a forty
seven<00:04:31.420> eighty<00:04:31.630> fours<00:04:31.930> four<00:04:32.230> thousand<00:04:32.650> seven

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
seven eighty fours four thousand seven

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.680 
seven eighty fours four thousand seven
hundred<00:04:33.010> eighty<00:04:33.280> four<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:33.760> slightly<00:04:34.510> higher

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
hundred eighty four so slightly higher

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.040 
hundred eighty four so slightly higher
on<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.320> galaxy<00:04:35.800> s3<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.630> what<00:04:37.630> I'm<00:04:37.750> not<00:04:37.870> really

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
on the galaxy s3 and what I'm not really

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.690 
on the galaxy s3 and what I'm not really
surprised<00:04:38.470> by<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.770> considering<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.400> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
surprised by that considering that the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.730 
surprised by that considering that the
application<00:04:40.330> speed<00:04:40.510> test<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:40.870> far<00:04:41.110> haven't

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
application speed test so far haven't

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.770 
application speed test so far haven't
been<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.190> favor<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.880> galaxy<00:04:43.210> s3<00:04:43.480> as<00:04:43.600> well

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
been in favor of the galaxy s3 as well

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.840 
been in favor of the galaxy s3 as well
so<00:04:43.990> go<00:04:44.140> ahead<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.320> hit<00:04:44.950> home<00:04:45.190> out<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.520> here

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
so go ahead and hit home out of here

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.720 
so go ahead and hit home out of here
next<00:04:46.390> application<00:04:46.660> will<00:04:46.930> run<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:48.070> camera

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
next application will run is the camera

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.890 
next application will run is the camera
app<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.180> want<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.420> see<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.660> know<00:04:49.780> which

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
app so I want to see you know which

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.140 
app so I want to see you know which
one's<00:04:50.230> gonna<00:04:50.320> load<00:04:50.590> up<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:51.220> camera<00:04:51.610> first<00:04:51.790> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
one's gonna load up the camera first and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.490 
one's gonna load up the camera first and
you<00:04:52.270> know<00:04:52.360> which<00:04:52.660> one<00:04:52.810> will<00:04:52.900> let<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.230> take<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
you know which one will let you take the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.440 
you know which one will let you take the
picture<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.980> that<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.550> know<00:04:54.640> Kodak<00:04:55.000> moment<00:04:55.360> so

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
picture of that you know Kodak moment so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.060 
picture of that you know Kodak moment so
let's<00:04:55.570> go<00:04:55.660> ahead<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.020> press<00:04:56.260> camera<00:04:56.950> at<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
let's go ahead and press camera at the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.630 
let's go ahead and press camera at the
same<00:04:57.190> time<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.670> one<00:04:57.910> two<00:04:58.210> three<00:04:59.010> and<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.550> can

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
same time so one two three and you can

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.120 
same time so one two three and you can
see<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:00.850> viewfinder<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:02.500> looking<00:05:02.860> at<00:05:02.980> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
see the viewfinder was looking at the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.400 
see the viewfinder was looking at the
image<00:05:03.430> way<00:05:03.700> before<00:05:04.060> on<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.510> HTC<00:05:04.810> One<00:05:05.020> X<00:05:05.200> then

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
image way before on the HTC One X then

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.140 
image way before on the HTC One X then
it<00:05:05.500> wasn't<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.800> galaxy<00:05:06.130> s3<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.640> case<00:05:06.850> so

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
it wasn't the galaxy s3 in this case so

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.650 
it wasn't the galaxy s3 in this case so
definitely<00:05:08.020> advantage<00:05:08.590> goes<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.820> One<00:05:10.360> X

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
definitely advantage goes to the One X

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.140 
definitely advantage goes to the One X
and<00:05:11.010> let's<00:05:12.010> go<00:05:12.100> ahead<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.340> do<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.670> browser

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
and let's go ahead and do the browser

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.940 
and let's go ahead and do the browser
speed<00:05:13.480> test<00:05:13.690> now<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:13.900> I'm<00:05:14.560> going<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.830> leave

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
speed test now so I'm going to leave

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.130 
speed test now so I'm going to leave
those<00:05:15.130> two<00:05:15.340> apps<00:05:15.520> up<00:05:15.760> open<00:05:16.480> in<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.660> background

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
those two apps up open in the background

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.100 
those two apps up open in the background
will<00:05:17.410> open<00:05:17.800> up<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.130> browser<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.870> first

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
will open up the browser and the first

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.600 
will open up the browser and the first
website<00:05:20.500> we're<00:05:20.620> gonna<00:05:20.710> visit<00:05:20.920> of<00:05:21.160> course<00:05:21.400> is

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
website we're gonna visit of course is

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.190 
website we're gonna visit of course is
gonna<00:05:21.790> be<00:05:22.030> bomb<00:05:22.690> buff<00:05:22.900> calm<00:05:24.660> alright<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:25.900> I

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
gonna be bomb buff calm alright so I

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.930 
gonna be bomb buff calm alright so I
loaded<00:05:26.560> from<00:05:26.920> our<00:05:27.130> typed<00:05:27.370> in<00:05:27.490> phone<00:05:27.670> book<00:05:27.820> on

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
loaded from our typed in phone book on

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.040 
loaded from our typed in phone book on
both<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.480> one<00:05:28.720> two<00:05:29.320> three

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.720 

looks<00:05:35.050> like<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.470> Galaxy<00:05:35.890> s3<00:05:35.980> is<00:05:36.190> populating

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
looks like the Galaxy s3 is populating

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.910 
looks like the Galaxy s3 is populating
the<00:05:37.240> website<00:05:38.020> a<00:05:38.050> little<00:05:38.230> bit<00:05:38.410> faster<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.710> see

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
the website a little bit faster I see

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.940 
the website a little bit faster I see
the<00:05:39.010> logo<00:05:39.310> but<00:05:40.080> um<00:05:41.080> this<00:05:41.350> guy<00:05:41.500> pretty<00:05:41.770> much

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
the logo but um this guy pretty much

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.560 
the logo but um this guy pretty much
caught<00:05:42.130> up<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.400> finish<00:05:42.670> pretty<00:05:43.210> much<00:05:43.360> at<00:05:43.510> the

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
caught up the finish pretty much at the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.570 
caught up the finish pretty much at the
same<00:05:43.690> time<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.170> think<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.980> loading<00:05:45.400> bar

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
same time I think the loading bar

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.430 
same time I think the loading bar
finished<00:05:45.940> first<00:05:46.180> on<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.600> galaxy<00:05:46.990> s3<00:05:47.110> in<00:05:47.350> this

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
finished first on the galaxy s3 in this

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.350 
finished first on the galaxy s3 in this
case<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:48.040> honestly<00:05:48.760> I<00:05:48.850> was<00:05:48.970> too<00:05:49.120> close<00:05:49.300> to

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
case but honestly I was too close to

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.000 
case but honestly I was too close to
call<00:05:49.690> pretty<00:05:50.140> much<00:05:50.230> just<00:05:50.290> call<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.680> at<00:05:50.830> I

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
call pretty much just call that at I

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.370 
call pretty much just call that at I
will<00:05:51.670> go<00:05:51.790> ahead<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.120> load<00:05:52.660> up<00:05:52.810> an<00:05:52.930> application

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
will go ahead and load up an application

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.310 
will go ahead and load up an application
will<00:05:53.470> look<00:05:53.590> up<00:05:53.740> this<00:05:54.310> iPhone<00:05:55.210> article<00:05:55.960> so<00:05:56.140> one

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
will look up this iPhone article so one

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:05.520 
will look up this iPhone article so one
two<00:05:56.620> three<00:06:03.120> all<00:06:04.120> right<00:06:04.180> really<00:06:04.870> close<00:06:05.200> again<00:06:05.500> I

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
two three all right really close again I

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.170 
two three all right really close again I
mean<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:05.950> I<00:06:06.190> couldn't<00:06:06.640> tell<00:06:06.790> the<00:06:06.880> difference

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
mean I I couldn't tell the difference

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.370 
mean I I couldn't tell the difference
you<00:06:07.240> guys<00:06:07.390> could<00:06:07.540> be<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.720> judge<00:06:07.900> of<00:06:07.930> that

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
you guys could be the judge of that

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.050 
you guys could be the judge of that
you<00:06:08.620> know<00:06:08.740> write<00:06:09.250> down<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.610> comments<00:06:09.970> what

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
you know write down in the comments what

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.270 
you know write down in the comments what
you<00:06:10.180> guys<00:06:10.240> think<00:06:10.540> one<00:06:10.780> maybe<00:06:11.680> I'd<00:06:12.070> have<00:06:12.190> to

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
you guys think one maybe I'd have to

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520 
you guys think one maybe I'd have to
rewind<00:06:12.640> it<00:06:12.790> and<00:06:12.910> plate<00:06:13.240> you<00:06:13.450> know<00:06:13.570> again<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.440> be

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
rewind it and plate you know again to be

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.900 
rewind it and plate you know again to be
able<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.710> see<00:06:14.860> that<00:06:14.950> so<00:06:15.100> let's<00:06:15.220> go<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:15.400> nfl.com

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
able to see that so let's go to nfl.com

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.690 
able to see that so let's go to nfl.com
hopefully<00:06:16.750> this<00:06:17.680> website<00:06:18.130> will<00:06:18.280> give<00:06:18.430> us<00:06:18.550> a

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
hopefully this website will give us a

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.120 
hopefully this website will give us a
better<00:06:19.120> indicator<00:06:19.570> as<00:06:19.780> far<00:06:20.020> as<00:06:20.230> which<00:06:20.890> one's

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
better indicator as far as which one's

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.740 
better indicator as far as which one's
gonna<00:06:21.250> be<00:06:21.430> faster<00:06:21.880> but<00:06:22.120> you're<00:06:22.480> given<00:06:22.690> the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
gonna be faster but you're given the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
gonna be faster but you're given the
fact<00:06:22.930> that<00:06:22.960> these<00:06:23.110> guys<00:06:23.290> share<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.620> same

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
fact that these guys share the same

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.830 
fact that these guys share the same
processor<00:06:24.280> I'm<00:06:24.700> not<00:06:25.030> sure<00:06:25.180> if<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.330> extra<00:06:25.600> gig

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
processor I'm not sure if the extra gig

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.700 
processor I'm not sure if the extra gig
of<00:06:26.050> ram<00:06:26.080> is<00:06:26.350> gonna<00:06:26.530> make

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
of ram is gonna make

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.080 
of ram is gonna make
that<00:06:26.860> much<00:06:26.980> of<00:06:27.010> difference<00:06:27.310> go<00:06:27.730> ahead<00:06:27.850> and<00:06:28.000> hit

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
that much of difference go ahead and hit

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.950 
that much of difference go ahead and hit
go<00:06:28.420> one<00:06:28.840> two<00:06:29.350> three<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:33.580> in<00:06:34.240> this<00:06:34.360> case<00:06:34.630> it

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
go one two three and in this case it

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.410 
go one two three and in this case it
looks<00:06:35.170> like<00:06:35.470> the<00:06:35.770> galaxy<00:06:36.310> s3<00:06:36.400> had<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.120> good

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
looks like the galaxy s3 had a good

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.390 
looks like the galaxy s3 had a good
advantage<00:06:37.810> on<00:06:38.110> here<00:06:38.290> so<00:06:38.470> pretty<00:06:39.160> much<00:06:39.250> our

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
advantage on here so pretty much our

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.150 
advantage on here so pretty much our
first<00:06:39.640> separation<00:06:40.450> that<00:06:40.510> we<00:06:40.570> got

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
first separation that we got

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.350 
first separation that we got
accidentally<00:06:42.160> hit<00:06:42.370> an<00:06:42.460> article<00:06:42.910> so<00:06:43.120> let's<00:06:43.240> go

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
accidentally hit an article so let's go

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.770 
accidentally hit an article so let's go
down<00:06:43.570> to<00:06:43.930> the<00:06:44.230> full<00:06:44.650> website<00:06:45.480> so<00:06:46.480> when<00:06:46.630> we<00:06:46.690> hit

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
down to the full website so when we hit

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:54.350 
down to the full website so when we hit
desktop<00:06:47.260> at<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:47.530> same<00:06:47.680> time<00:06:47.920> one<00:06:48.760> two<00:06:49.450> three

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.580 

so<00:06:55.360> all<00:06:55.420> the<00:06:55.540> content<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:55.930> little<00:06:56.020> bit<00:06:56.140> faster

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
so all the content a little bit faster

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.150 
so all the content a little bit faster
on<00:06:56.770> the<00:06:57.010> one<00:06:57.190> X<00:06:57.370> this<00:06:58.150> guy<00:06:58.360> is<00:06:58.420> done<00:06:58.690> and<00:06:58.960> now

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
on the one X this guy is done and now

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.340 
on the one X this guy is done and now
this<00:07:00.160> guy's<00:07:00.340> done<00:07:00.490> so<00:07:00.760> um<00:07:01.480> pretty<00:07:01.990> much<00:07:02.230> I<00:07:02.320> mean

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
this guy's done so um pretty much I mean

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.230 
this guy's done so um pretty much I mean
is<00:07:02.590> really<00:07:03.220> really<00:07:03.400> close<00:07:03.670> but<00:07:03.970> maybe<00:07:04.090> the

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
is really really close but maybe the

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.470 
is really really close but maybe the
slight<00:07:04.450> advantage<00:07:04.630> goes<00:07:05.050> to<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.230> galaxy<00:07:05.740> s3

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
slight advantage goes to the galaxy s3

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.060 
slight advantage goes to the galaxy s3
that's<00:07:07.480> pretty<00:07:07.660> much<00:07:07.780> it<00:07:07.960> for<00:07:08.290> the<00:07:08.620> speed

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
that's pretty much it for the speed

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.740 
that's pretty much it for the speed
prepare<00:07:09.460> some<00:07:09.640> tests<00:07:09.880> hopefully<00:07:10.510> this<00:07:10.630> gives

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
prepare some tests hopefully this gives

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.000 
prepare some tests hopefully this gives
you<00:07:10.870> a<00:07:10.930> better<00:07:11.140> idea<00:07:11.260> as<00:07:11.500> far<00:07:11.560> as<00:07:11.740> which
