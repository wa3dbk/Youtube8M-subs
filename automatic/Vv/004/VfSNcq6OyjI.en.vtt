Polaroid<00:01:51.299> print<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.899> adds<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.439> bit

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
from eBay so this is a really really

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.570 
from eBay so this is a really really
cheap<00:02:10.140> DIY

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
cheap DIY

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
cheap DIY
first<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.330> lined<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.200> what

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
first of all I just lined up what

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
first of all I just lined up what
pictures<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.160> wanted<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.610> put<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.240> card<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
pictures I wanted to put on the card and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.630 
pictures I wanted to put on the card and
I<00:02:16.020> thought<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.470> four<00:02:16.830> pictures<00:02:17.130> was<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I thought that four pictures was the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.670 
I thought that four pictures was the
perfect<00:02:18.180> amount<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.320> how<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.470> play

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
perfect amount so just how to play

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.130 
perfect amount so just how to play
around<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.430> once<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.910> decided<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.690> just

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
around and then once I decided I just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.260 
around and then once I decided I just
cut<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.160> paper<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:23.670> needed<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
cut out the paper which needed to be

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.930 
cut out the paper which needed to be
this<00:02:25.020> frame<00:02:25.410> size<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.430> wasn't<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
this frame size and really wasn't the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
this frame size and really wasn't the
same<00:02:27.120> size<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> card<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.230> cut<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
same size as the card so I just cut this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
same size as the card so I just cut this
out<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> they<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.640> print<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.240> fit

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
out so that they have print with fit

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:47.390 
out so that they have print with fit
properly<00:02:45.020> then<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:46.650> positioned<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
properly then I just positioned the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
properly then I just positioned the
Polaroids<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.270> ruler<00:02:48.720> trying<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
Polaroids of a ruler trying to make it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.400 
Polaroids of a ruler trying to make it
as<00:02:49.560> straight<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> even<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:51.090> possible<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.840> let

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
as straight and even as possible I let

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.290 
as straight and even as possible I let
you<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.770> place<00:02:52.980> them<00:02:53.310> using<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> ruler

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
you just place them using a ruler

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.450 
you just place them using a ruler
nothing<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.230> know<00:02:55.320> too<00:02:55.770> hard<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.400> I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
nothing to you know too hard and then I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.000 
nothing to you know too hard and then I
literally<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:56.880> my<00:02:57.030> washi<00:02:57.270> tape<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.010> did

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
literally got my washi tape and just did

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.040 
literally got my washi tape and just did
a<00:02:59.040> little<00:02:59.340> strip<00:02:59.970> at<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.120> top<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.870> put

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
a little strip at the top I just put

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.630 
a little strip at the top I just put
this<00:03:01.200> added<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.770> little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> cool<00:03:02.610> effect

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
this added a little bit of a cool effect

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:36.590 
this added a little bit of a cool effect
and<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.300> really<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.990> brightness<00:03:04.230> too

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.420 

once<00:03:37.600> you've<00:03:37.900> taped<00:03:38.320> all<00:03:38.620> your<00:03:38.800> Polaroids<00:03:39.250> to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
once you've taped all your Polaroids to

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.860 
once you've taped all your Polaroids to
the<00:03:39.550> picture<00:03:39.970> you're<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.270> going<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.510> pop<00:03:40.660> it

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
the picture you're just going to pop it

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.870 
the picture you're just going to pop it
into<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.320> frame<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.920> put<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.670> back

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
into the frame and put it to the back

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000 
into the frame and put it to the back
and<00:03:43.060> you're<00:03:43.570> basically<00:03:44.020> done<00:03:44.200> it's<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.740> easy

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and you're basically done it's so easy

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.400 
and you're basically done it's so easy
to<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.520> it's<00:03:46.240> kind<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.600> foolproof<00:03:46.900> even

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
to do it's kind of foolproof even

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.440 
to do it's kind of foolproof even
someone<00:03:47.890> like<00:03:47.920> me<00:03:48.220> who's<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> real<00:03:48.730> klutz<00:03:49.030> can

when<00:04:34.390> I<00:04:34.450> use<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.690> ruler<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.140> managed<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.620> go<00:04:35.860> off<00:04:36.130> a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
when I use a ruler I managed to go off a

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.950 
when I use a ruler I managed to go off a
straight<00:04:36.790> line<00:04:36.940> because<00:04:37.180> I'm<00:04:37.450> an<00:04:37.570> idiot

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
straight line because I'm an idiot

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440 
straight line because I'm an idiot
and<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:39.070> make<00:04:39.370> sure<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.790> don't<00:04:40.000> do<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.330> like

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
and so make sure you don't do that like

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.240 
and so make sure you don't do that like
I<00:04:40.510> did<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:41.020> basically<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.980> beauty

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250

I've got these jars from the range for 1
pound<00:05:08.200> each<00:05:08.620> which<00:05:08.890> I<00:05:09.010> thought<00:05:09.190> was<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> bargain

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
pound each which I thought was a bargain

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.580 
pound each which I thought was a bargain
and<00:05:10.180> yet<00:05:10.660> you're<00:05:10.960> just<00:05:10.990> going<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.260> take<00:05:11.410> your

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.110 
and yet you're just going to take your
washi<00:05:11.800> tape<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.310> just<00:05:12.550> pop<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.850> around<00:05:12.970> the

edge<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.750> jars<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.230> just<00:05:14.500> think<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:14.800> adds

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
edge of the jars I just think this adds

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.650 
edge of the jars I just think this adds
a<00:05:15.250> little<00:05:15.550> bit<00:05:15.640> of<00:05:15.730> color<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.240> makes<00:05:16.450> them

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
a little bit of color and makes them

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.540 
a little bit of color and makes them
look<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.840> little<00:05:16.930> bit<00:05:17.290> different<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:17.920> then<00:05:18.460> you

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
look a little bit different and then you

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.370 
look a little bit different and then you
can<00:05:18.700> also<00:05:18.910> put<00:05:19.090> some<00:05:19.600> washi<00:05:19.810> tape<00:05:20.080> on<00:05:20.200> the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
can also put some washi tape on the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.010 
can also put some washi tape on the
front<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.860> can<00:05:20.920> write<00:05:21.310> on<00:05:21.640> maybe<00:05:22.060> nudes<00:05:22.600> or
