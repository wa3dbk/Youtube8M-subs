what's next how do you switch over in a
short<00:00:12.900> period<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.320> time<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.880> away<00:00:15.089> from<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
short period of time and get away from a

short period of time and get away from a
system<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.320> has<00:00:16.379> taken<00:00:16.800> us<00:00:17.130> literally<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
system that has taken us literally a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.240 
system that has taken us literally a
hundred<00:00:18.449> years<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.020> build<00:00:19.230> there's<00:00:19.920> people

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
hundred years to build there's people

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
hundred years to build there's people
working<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> electric<00:00:21.300> car<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.529> that's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
working on the electric car that that's

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.960 
working on the electric car that that's
getting<00:00:22.980> rid<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> internal<00:00:23.670> combustion

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
getting rid of the internal combustion

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.689 
getting rid of the internal combustion
engine<00:00:24.359> what<00:00:24.810> would<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.699> 710

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.150 
engine what would you do with the 710
million<00:00:27.150> internal<00:00:28.080> combustion<00:00:28.650> engines<00:00:28.980> and

America<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.550> can't

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
America what would you do with you can't

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
America what would you do with you can't
put<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> dump<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> no<00:00:34.440> you've<00:00:34.920> got<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
put them in a dump so no you've got to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
put them in a dump so no you've got to
start<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.980> maybe<00:00:37.980> there

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
start with what you got and maybe there

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.180 
start with what you got and maybe there
will<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.730> where<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.840> new<00:00:40.530> duel<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
will come a time where a new duel or a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.490 
will come a time where a new duel or a
new<00:00:41.670> technology<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.500> completely

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
new technology will completely

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350 
new technology will completely
revolutionize<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.460> mean<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.670> what

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
revolutionize I mean that's what

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
revolutionize I mean that's what
happened<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.020> combustion<00:00:46.350> engine<00:00:46.770> then

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
happened with the combustion engine then

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
happened with the combustion engine then
we<00:00:47.309> got<00:00:47.430> away<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.670> horses<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.870> away

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we got away from horses and got away

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.760 
we got away from horses and got away
from<00:00:49.110> scheme<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> long<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.090> off<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
from scheme but it's a long way off and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.900 
from scheme but it's a long way off and
economically<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.039> world<00:00:53.250> world<00:00:53.640> can't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
economically the world world can't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
economically the world world can't
sustain<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.649> type<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.190> approach

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
sustain it so this type of an approach

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
sustain it so this type of an approach
which<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> most<00:00:57.300> common<00:00:57.690> sense<00:00:57.899> approach<00:00:57.989> at

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
which the most common sense approach at

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.180 
which the most common sense approach at
all<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.760> will<00:01:00.629> bridge<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> gap<00:01:01.410> between<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
all it will bridge the gap between the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.119 
all it will bridge the gap between the
technologies<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> exist<00:01:03.239> today<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.710> need

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
technologies that exist today the need

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to find some fuel reduction the need to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
to find some fuel reduction the need to
reduce<00:01:08.850> greenhouse<00:01:09.630> gases<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.409> particular

accomplice which we say so
right<00:01:32.210> now<00:01:32.390> especially<00:01:33.110> folks<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:33.860> North

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
right now especially folks in North

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.040 
right now especially folks in North
America<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:35.030> are<00:01:35.210> they're<00:01:35.690> going<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.930> look

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
America they are they're going to look

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.650 
America they are they're going to look
for<00:01:36.260> any<00:01:36.440> way<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.010> they<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.330> reduce<00:01:38.330> their

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
for any way that they can reduce their

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.440 
for any way that they can reduce their
bill<00:01:39.440> at<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.650> pump<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.040> they're<00:01:40.940> also<00:01:41.120> going

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
bill at the pump and they're also going

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.410 
bill at the pump and they're also going
to<00:01:41.510> be<00:01:41.690> more<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.470> more<00:01:42.590> concern<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.730> reduce

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
to be more and more concern to reduce

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.050 
to be more and more concern to reduce
emissions<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.770> city<00:01:46.070> centres<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:46.970> think

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
emissions in city centres and so I think

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.350 
emissions in city centres and so I think
the<00:01:47.330> world<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:47.630> ready<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.640> message<00:01:50.120> that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
the world is ready it's a message that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.390 
the world is ready it's a message that
has<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.810> go<00:01:50.930> out<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.740> government

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
has to go out is that the government

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.560 
has to go out is that the government
must<00:01:52.970> must<00:01:53.780> must<00:01:54.550> do<00:01:55.550> what<00:01:55.790> they<00:01:55.940> have<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.150> do

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
must must must do what they have to do

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.990 
must must must do what they have to do
to<00:01:56.600> advance<00:01:56.960> not<00:01:57.680> only<00:01:58.010> our<00:01:58.220> technology<00:01:58.970> but

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
to advance not only our technology but

any technology that will reduce
greenhouse<00:02:01.700> gases<00:02:02.000> because<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.050> most
