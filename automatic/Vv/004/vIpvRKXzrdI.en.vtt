00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
well what would be very important to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.679 
well what would be very important to
other<00:00:17.789> people<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.090> course<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.080> graphics

exactly<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.609> considering<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.630> first

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
exactly now considering that you first

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
exactly now considering that you first
have<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> look<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> CPU<00:00:28.590> ah<00:00:29.130> apparently

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
have to look at the CPU ah apparently

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
have to look at the CPU ah apparently
both<00:00:30.570> consoles<00:00:31.199> tell<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> same<00:00:32.040> number

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
both consoles tell you the same number

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.819 
both consoles tell you the same number
of<00:00:32.460> cores<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.540> same<00:00:33.780> aim<00:00:34.020> D<00:00:34.230> architecture

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
does this mean it means that the Xbox

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.149 
does this mean it means that the Xbox
has<00:01:23.729> bigger<00:01:24.090> numbers<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> actually

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
has bigger numbers but it actually

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.020 
has bigger numbers but it actually
underperform<00:01:26.159> slightly<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
underperform slightly because of the
