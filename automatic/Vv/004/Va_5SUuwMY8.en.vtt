obviously I went away from my honeymoon
to<00:00:27.869> Cancun<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.500> literally<00:00:29.220> came<00:00:29.490> back<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> few

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
to Cancun I literally came back a few

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
to Cancun I literally came back a few
days<00:00:29.970> ago<00:00:30.269> mm-hmm<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> I've<00:00:31.529> read<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.980> my

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
days ago mm-hmm and I've read you my

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.450 
days ago mm-hmm and I've read you my
training<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.450> resumed<00:00:33.840> using<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.710> grand

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
training and I resumed using my grand

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
training and I resumed using my grand
hydro<00:00:35.850> six<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
hydro six and then that's when I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.170 
hydro six and then that's when I
realized<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.780> how<00:00:39.780> effective<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
realized how much how effective this is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.119 
realized how much how effective this is
compared<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> most<00:00:42.420> proteins<00:00:43.129> because

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
compared to most proteins because

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
compared to most proteins because
obviously<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> world's<00:00:45.390> first

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
obviously this is the world's first

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950 
obviously this is the world's first
50/50<00:00:46.590> split<00:00:46.860> whey<00:00:47.550> isolate<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.360> micellar

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
50/50 split whey isolate and micellar

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.850 
50/50 split whey isolate and micellar
casein<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:51.510> also<00:00:51.930> did<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> mixed<00:00:52.590> test

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
casein and I also did the mixed test

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
casein and I also did the mixed test
when<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> first<00:00:53.699> got<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
when I first got this and if you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.590 
when I first got this and if you
remember<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.899> quite<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:56.149> white<00:00:57.149> isolate

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
remember it was quite a white isolate

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.130 
remember it was quite a white isolate
itself<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.620> pure<00:00:58.890> yet<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.180> fun<00:01:00.480> was

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
itself is very pure yet very fun was

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
itself is very pure yet very fun was
good<00:01:01.289> obviously<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.800> great<00:01:01.890> post-workout

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
good obviously it's great post-workout

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
good obviously it's great post-workout
it's<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.239> shred<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> muscles<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it's gonna shred to the muscles and all

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.170 
it's gonna shred to the muscles and all
that<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.920> yeah<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> casein<00:01:05.670> obviously<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that but yeah the casein obviously it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
that but yeah the casein obviously it's
a<00:01:06.240> thick<00:01:08.600> protein<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.260> supposed<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
a thick protein which is supposed to be

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
a thick protein which is supposed to be
useful<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.610> night<00:01:11.820> time<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:12.450> takes<00:01:12.689> up

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
useful at night time because he takes up

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
useful at night time because he takes up
to<00:01:13.049> pick<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> seven<00:01:14.280> hours<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> body

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to pick up to seven hours for the body

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
to pick up to seven hours for the body
to<00:01:15.060> break<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> 50/50

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to break it down so when it was a 50/50

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.920 
to break it down so when it was a 50/50
split<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.939> didn't<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.270> mixer<00:01:18.509> says<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.750> could

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
split and I didn't my mixer says I could

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.300 
split and I didn't my mixer says I could
read<00:01:19.110> every<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> use<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:19.950> well<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
read every time I use it as well I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
read every time I use it as well I
really<00:01:21.030> feel<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.290> thick<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.799> too

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
really feel it it was thick but not too

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.719 
really feel it it was thick but not too
thick<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.049> quite<00:01:25.229> filling<00:01:25.770> yet<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
thick so it was quite filling yet not to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.330 
thick so it was quite filling yet not to
him<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.270> stand<00:01:27.600> myself<00:01:28.290> casing<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.009> case

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
him but to stand myself casing or case

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.469 
him but to stand myself casing or case
in<00:01:29.490> general<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.850> effectiveness<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.090> give<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in general so effectiveness I give it a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.499 
in general so effectiveness I give it a
ten<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> ten<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.729> being<00:01:35.729> rich<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
ten out of ten because being rich in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
ten out of ten because being rich in
whey<00:01:37.290> isolate<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.220> felt<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.729> recovered

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
whey isolate I really felt I recovered

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840 
whey isolate I really felt I recovered
much<00:01:39.659> better<00:01:39.930> throughout<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.530> workouts<00:01:41.009> sorry

absorption<00:04:05.510> casein<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.690> absorbed<00:04:07.169> a<00:04:07.349> much

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
absorption casein is absorbed a much

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.580 
absorption casein is absorbed a much
slower<00:04:08.340> rate<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.909> footers<00:04:09.540> aminos<00:04:10.049> into<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
slower rate and footers aminos into the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.580 
slower rate and footers aminos into the
bloodstream<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.370> 48<00:04:12.060> hours<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.109> yeah

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
bloodstream of the 48 hours so yeah

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.870 
bloodstream of the 48 hours so yeah
about<00:04:13.919> around<00:04:14.190> 7<00:04:16.459> because<00:04:17.459> obviously<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:17.820> is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
about around 7 because obviously this is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.729 
about around 7 because obviously this is
50/50<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.599> it's<00:04:18.720> not<00:04:18.870> pure<00:04:19.199> might<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
50/50 so it's not pure might of the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.370 
50/50 so it's not pure might of the
pacing<00:04:20.099> anyway<00:04:20.699> perfect<00:04:21.419> before<00:04:21.690> bed<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:22.289> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
pacing anyway perfect before bed as I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.190 
pacing anyway perfect before bed as I
mentioned<00:04:22.830> as<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.940> has<00:04:24.479> any<00:04:24.750> catabolic

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
mentioned as is has any catabolic

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.530 
mentioned as is has any catabolic
effects<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.889> helps<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.490> recovery

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
effects and helps with recovery

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
effects and helps with recovery
so<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.770> know<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.920> get<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> boss<00:04:29.430> best<00:04:29.760> of

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
so you know you get the boss best of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.820 
so you know you get the boss best of
both<00:04:30.000> worlds<00:04:30.300> best<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> forces<00:04:31.140> best<00:04:31.620> of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
both worlds best of the forces best of

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.520 
both worlds best of the forces best of
the<00:04:32.130> slowest<00:04:32.760> just<00:04:33.060> combined<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:34.170> great<00:04:34.380> to

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the slowest just combined it's great to

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.250 
the slowest just combined it's great to
see<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.610> are<00:04:35.760> getting<00:04:35.940> 50/50<00:04:36.600> split<00:04:36.900> nor

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
see that you are getting 50/50 split nor

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.630 
see that you are getting 50/50 split nor
80/20<00:04:38.040> which<00:04:39.920> unites<00:04:40.920> groups<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.520> good

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
80/20 which unites groups is just good

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.730 
80/20 which unites groups is just good
to<00:04:41.760> see<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:42.000> general<00:04:42.240> how<00:04:42.780> much<00:04:43.080> of<00:04:43.380> the
