00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
and then I came up with this idea

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.760 
and then I came up with this idea
because<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> starting<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> trend

happening with battlefield and other

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
happening with battlefield and other

it I'm not going to be mad at it if it's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.690 
it I'm not going to be mad at it if it's
not<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.660> call<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.200> game<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:32.250> way<00:02:32.280> I'm

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
not a call to the game the way I'm

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.010 
not a call to the game the way I'm
looking<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.920> saying<00:02:35.520> that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
looking at it is this I'm saying that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.490 
looking at it is this I'm saying that
call<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.200> duty<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.970> name<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
call of duty is just a name of the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.949 
call of duty is just a name of the
baseline<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> game<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.510> see<00:02:42.720> call

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
baseline of the game so if you see call

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
baseline of the game so if you see call
duty<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> says<00:02:44.130> advanced<00:02:44.519> warfare

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
duty and then it says advanced warfare

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
duty and then it says advanced warfare
or<00:02:45.360> doesn't<00:02:46.140> say<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.319> modern<00:02:46.769> more<00:02:46.980> modern

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550

play it that is it's basically a

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.280 
play it that is it's basically a
spin-off<00:05:36.840> it's<00:05:37.440> really<00:05:37.890> just<00:05:38.160> a<00:05:38.340> spin-off<00:05:39.290> so

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290
