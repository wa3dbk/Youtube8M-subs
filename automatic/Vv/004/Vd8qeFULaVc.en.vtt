00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.890
 hi people here wd gamer ya 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.680
 next let's see how it affects 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.050
 wear a bulletproof vest or it is not 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.439
 advantage that they were not modern warfare 3 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 and he's back with white 2 and the truth is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.900
 enough curious things we are going to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 analyze the lethal the rpg and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.400
 the low runs and here we are with 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.870
 the lethal ones 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.740
 c4 without vest c4 with vest playmore 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.660
 with no vest playmore with vest 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.540
 bouncing without bouncing vest with 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.420
 vest 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.820
 fragmentation without vest 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 and fragmentation with vest 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.480
 then added the typical 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.720
 spoils more load communication using 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.350
 both people without vest kills and with 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.540
 vest does not kill conclusion with vest 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 you save yourself from any lethal and without 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.750
 vest you die 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.520
 we go with the streaks of points the asx of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 the hunter also kills the missile 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.730
 lightning the lightning attack also the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.160
 missile heston also 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.130
 the war machine does not kill the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.890
 agr system is with the missile pressing 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.680
 the e1 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.229
 and in the being you kill conclusion 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.120
 against bulletproof vest gushes not 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.100
 it's so effective since it only saves you from the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.990
 war machine for a hit if they give you 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.509
 two also kill you and finally the rpg 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.910
 but if you wear bulletproof vest will pass 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.890
 something like that will make an impact and not what 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.500
 will kill no matter how close we are and if 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.979
 He does not wear it, so we'll kill him. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.920
 final with the lethal ones is very useful 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.710
 because it protects you from anything I 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.990
 I recommend it maybe be a little 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.360
 tied but good is recommended 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.039
 moment but with the gusts you do not have 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.630
 nothing to do because it only protects you from 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 the death machine against the gusts 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.519
 You will be the same as if you did not wear 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.680
 bulletproof vest so with the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.260
 Lethal is great but with the gusts not 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.200
 both with the rpg and with the smile 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.290
 also because he defends you very well because 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 even if you make an impact on the body stuck 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.610
 you're not going to kill him dying marker so 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.840
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.390
 guide bar tutorial bar uses 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.000
 and leave me in the comments you want 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.280

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.680
