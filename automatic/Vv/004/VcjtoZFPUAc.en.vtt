and show you how fantastic it is to have
multitouch<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:08.500> okay<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:09.560> loads<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
multitouch on it okay so loads it up and

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
the first thing it should do is probably

to zoom in and then you can zoom back
out<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:42.629> can<00:02:42.780> use<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.079> plus<00:02:43.349> or<00:02:43.530> minuses<00:02:44.010> to

zoom in and out or you can just use

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.539 
zoom in and out or you can just use
multi<00:02:46.200> touch<00:02:46.379> since<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:46.980> easier<00:02:47.010> if

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
multi touch since it's much easier if

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.940 
multi touch since it's much easier if

so<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:17.099> zoom<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.519> right<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.849> there<00:03:18.319> we<00:03:19.319> can

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so we can zoom in right on there we can

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.930 
so we can zoom in right on there we can
click<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:20.129> we<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.639> directions

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
click on that we can get directions

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.460 
click on that we can get directions
there<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> show<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.109> on<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.260> map

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
there you can show it on the map

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.189 
there you can show it on the map
navigate<00:03:23.190> street<00:03:23.669> view<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.959> good<00:03:25.169> stuff

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
navigate street view all that good stuff

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.210 
navigate street view all that good stuff
let's<00:03:25.650> make<00:03:25.829> sure<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.099> street<00:03:26.400> view<00:03:26.579> works

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
let's make sure the street view works

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.050 
let's make sure the street view works
and<00:03:30.169> sure<00:03:31.169> enough<00:03:31.199> it<00:03:31.590> does<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.609> see<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:32.940> can

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and sure enough it does you see we can

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.140 
and sure enough it does you see we can
swing<00:03:33.419> around<00:03:33.449> and<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.699> rose

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
swing around and there is the rose

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.449 
swing around and there is the rose
garden<00:03:36.599> okay<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:36.959> let's<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.470> back<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.159> let's

go back and we'll show you some of the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.319 
go back and we'll show you some of the
layers<00:03:40.260> they<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.799> still<00:03:41.069> work<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.400> well<00:03:41.609> we

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
layers they all still work as well we

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.189 
layers they all still work as well we
can<00:03:42.480> put<00:03:42.659> traffic<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.409> and<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.639> can<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:45.199> we

can put traffic on and as you can see we

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.439 
can put traffic on and as you can see we
got<00:03:46.440> green<00:03:46.889> everywhere<00:03:47.370> traffic<00:03:48.180> flowing

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
got green everywhere traffic flowing

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.509 
got green everywhere traffic flowing
nicely<00:03:48.659> in<00:03:48.989> Portland<00:03:49.379> today<00:03:49.500> let's<00:03:50.159> get<00:03:50.400> rid

new like measure I'm could have been in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.620 
new like measure I'm could have been in
the<00:04:19.650> olin<00:04:19.979> but<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.159> looks<00:04:20.280> new<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> me<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.389> now

we got all those options enabled and
let's<00:04:23.580> go<00:04:23.699> back<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.849> our<00:04:23.969> map<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.630> actually<00:04:25.469> if

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
let's go back to our map and actually if

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.670 
let's go back to our map and actually if
we<00:04:25.860> switch<00:04:26.250> back<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.880> without

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
we switch back to you without

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.020 
we switch back to you without
satellite<00:04:28.070> view<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.400> can<00:04:28.520> see<00:04:28.550> these<00:04:28.820> much

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
satellite view you can see these much

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.180 
satellite view you can see these much
easier<00:04:29.479> so<00:04:29.930> down<00:04:30.199> here<00:04:30.350> we<00:04:30.410> got<00:04:30.590> our<00:04:30.680> scale<00:04:30.979> bar

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
easier so down here we got our scale bar

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.390 
easier so down here we got our scale bar
now<00:04:31.449> we<00:04:32.449> have<00:04:32.720> our<00:04:33.169> measure<00:04:33.650> button<00:04:34.160> over<00:04:34.370> here

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
now we have our measure button over here

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.640 
now we have our measure button over here
and<00:04:35.030> we<00:04:35.270> got<00:04:35.419> our<00:04:35.509> layers<00:04:35.780> button<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.350> there

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
and we got our layers button down there

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.700 
and we got our layers button down there
and<00:04:36.919> if<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.639> go<00:04:37.789> back<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.120> location<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.590> will

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
and if I go back to my location you will

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.620 
and if I go back to my location you will
see<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.280> blue<00:04:40.490> arrow<00:04:40.759> now<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.180> pointing<00:04:41.570> in

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
see the blue arrow now is pointing in

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.080 
see the blue arrow now is pointing in
the<00:04:41.690> right<00:04:41.810> direction<00:04:41.870> compass<00:04:42.530> wise<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.310> as

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
the right direction compass wise so as

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.210 
the right direction compass wise so as
you<00:04:44.300> can<00:04:44.389> see<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:44.840> got<00:04:44.990> everything<00:04:45.350> it's<00:04:46.190> got

to map apps in here okay so we'll let
this<00:05:47.120> load<00:05:47.419> for<00:05:47.659> a<00:05:47.690> second<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:48.169> should<00:05:48.349> all<00:05:48.470> be

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
this load for a second it should all be

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.140 
this load for a second it should all be
alphabetically<00:05:49.220> although<00:05:49.490> sometimes<00:05:49.789> when

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
alphabetically although sometimes when

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
you install a new app it puts it towards

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.700 
you install a new app it puts it towards
the<00:05:51.770> top<00:05:51.979> for<00:05:52.250> whatever<00:05:52.580> reason<00:05:53.289> so<00:05:54.289> we'll<00:05:54.560> let

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
the top for whatever reason so we'll let

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.550 
the top for whatever reason so we'll let
that<00:05:54.770> load<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:55.880> you'll<00:05:56.690> see<00:05:56.900> we<00:05:57.080> got<00:05:57.199> two<00:05:57.320> maps

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
that load and you'll see we got two maps

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.399 
that load and you'll see we got two maps
up<00:05:57.770> here<00:05:58.070> that's<00:05:58.220> 5.6<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.270> megs<00:05:59.570> well<00:06:00.229> if<00:06:00.320> you

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
up here that's 5.6 to megs well if you

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.550 
up here that's 5.6 to megs well if you
can<00:06:00.530> see<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:00.740> maps<00:06:01.250> 5.6<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.240> megs<00:06:02.509> and<00:06:02.810> if<00:06:03.470> we

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
can see that maps 5.6 to megs and if we

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.100 
can see that maps 5.6 to megs and if we
scroll<00:06:03.949> down<00:06:04.090> you<00:06:05.090> should<00:06:05.150> have<00:06:05.570> another<00:06:05.780> map

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110
