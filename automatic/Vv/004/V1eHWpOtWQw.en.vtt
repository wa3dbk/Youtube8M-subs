standard<00:01:01.690> anomaly<00:01:02.350> resolution<00:01:02.950> process<00:01:03.460> so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
standard anomaly resolution process so

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.130 
standard anomaly resolution process so
they<00:01:03.820> formed<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.210> Commission<00:01:04.659> it's<00:01:04.929> going<00:01:05.109> to

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.020 
upcoming progress launches as well they
made<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.439> decision<00:01:23.859> and<00:01:24.009> we<00:01:24.640> think<00:01:24.759> it's<00:01:24.939> a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
made the decision and we think it's a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.809 
made the decision and we think it's a
prudent<00:01:25.359> 12<00:01:25.749> to<00:01:26.649> reshuffle<00:01:27.069> their<00:01:27.399> schedule<00:01:27.759> a

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
prudent 12 to reshuffle their schedule a

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.309 
prudent 12 to reshuffle their schedule a
little<00:01:28.030> bit<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.299> provide<00:01:28.780> them<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.109> extra

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
little bit and provide them the extra

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.440 
little bit and provide them the extra
time<00:01:29.530> necessary<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:30.219> finish<00:01:31.060> their<00:01:31.270> analysis

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
time necessary to finish their analysis

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.919 
time necessary to finish their analysis
and<00:01:32.049> determine<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.829> root<00:01:32.950> cause<00:01:33.299> okay<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.539> so

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
and determine the root cause okay and so

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.459 
and determine the root cause okay and so
I<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.109> that<00:01:35.710> 41<00:01:36.100> s<00:01:36.399> which<00:01:36.609> is<00:01:36.639> the<00:01:37.060> 41<00:01:37.689> Soyuz

new<00:01:56.649> schedule<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.310> give<00:01:57.429> us<00:01:57.549> at<00:01:57.700> least<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:58.060> feel

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
new schedule and give us at least a feel

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.940 
new schedule and give us at least a feel
for<00:01:58.689> when<00:01:58.810> they<00:01:58.959> might<00:01:59.170> try<00:01:59.529> to<00:01:59.590> bring<00:01:59.829> this

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
for when they might try to bring this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.029 
for when they might try to bring this
crew<00:02:00.189> home<00:02:00.369> really<00:02:00.729> gives<00:02:00.969> us<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.749> plan<00:02:02.439> for<00:02:02.799> how

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
crew home really gives us a plan for how

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.519 
crew home really gives us a plan for how
we<00:02:03.189> we<00:02:03.789> might<00:02:03.999> want<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.270> deal<00:02:04.509> on<00:02:04.749> orbit<00:02:05.350> with

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
we we might want to deal on orbit with

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.040 
we we might want to deal on orbit with
the<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:06.279> the<00:02:06.399> extra<00:02:06.700> time<00:02:06.909> with<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.240> crew<00:02:07.450> up

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the with the extra time with the crew up

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.509 
the with the extra time with the crew up
to<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.379> point<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:08.830> weren't<00:02:09.039> sure<00:02:09.159> if<00:02:09.189> it's<00:02:09.429> a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
to this point we weren't sure if it's a

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.640 
to this point we weren't sure if it's a
week<00:02:09.700> or<00:02:09.909> two<00:02:10.060> weeks<00:02:10.269> or<00:02:10.539> four<00:02:11.049> weeks<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.500> now

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
week or two weeks or four weeks and now

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.540 
week or two weeks or four weeks and now
that<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.159> little

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
that we have a little

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.220 
that we have a little
a<00:02:12.580> little<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:12.880> certainty<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.900> return

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
a little more certainty in the return

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.110 
a little more certainty in the return
plant<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.700> go<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.120> start<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.910> lay<00:02:18.910> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
plant we can go and start to to lay in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
plant we can go and start to to lay in
some<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.780> objectives<00:02:20.320> for<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> crew<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.860> try

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
some some objectives for the crew to try

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 
some some objectives for the crew to try
to<00:02:21.250> accomplish<00:02:21.640> we've<00:02:22.360> got<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> lot<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.780> on

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to accomplish we've got a lot going on

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.950 
to accomplish we've got a lot going on
in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.680> summer<00:02:23.890> time<00:02:24.130> frame<00:02:24.810> particularly<00:02:25.810> in

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
in the summer time frame particularly in

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.030 
in the summer time frame particularly in
the<00:02:26.140> area<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.410> trying<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.770> do<00:02:26.890> some

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the area of trying to do some

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.980 
the area of trying to do some
reconfigure<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.670> tree<00:02:28.120> configurations<00:02:28.810> of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
reconfigure a tree configurations of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.860 
reconfigure a tree configurations of
station<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.520> we're<00:02:30.790> looking<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.630> try<00:02:31.810> to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
station and so we're looking to try to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.390 
station and so we're looking to try to
move<00:02:32.020> some<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.260> those<00:02:32.380> activities<00:02:32.620> forward<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
move some of those activities forward a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.910 
move some of those activities forward a
little<00:02:33.520> bit<00:02:33.640> because<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:35.320> know<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.710> based

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
little bit because we we know that based

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
little bit because we we know that based
on<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> current<00:02:36.340> Russian<00:02:36.670> plan<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.360> we're

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
on the current Russian plan that we're

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.910 
on the current Russian plan that we're
probably<00:02:37.960> going<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.470> little<00:02:38.680> bit

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
probably going to have a little bit

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.040 
probably going to have a little bit
longer<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.820> what<00:02:40.180> we<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.690> call<00:02:40.960> an

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
longer of what we what we call an

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.720 
longer of what we what we call an
indirect<00:02:41.440> period<00:02:41.860> where<00:02:41.980> we'll<00:02:42.160> be<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.370> three

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
indirect period where we'll be a three

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.120 
indirect period where we'll be a three
crew<00:02:42.970> onboard<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.690> station<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.440> anything

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
crew onboard the station and so anything

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.070 
crew onboard the station and so anything
that<00:02:45.310> we<00:02:45.520> can<00:02:45.700> bring<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.720> particular

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
that we can bring in that particular

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.290 
that we can bring in that particular
part<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> schedule<00:02:48.460> back<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.970> left<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
part of the schedule back to the left a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.610 
part of the schedule back to the left a
little<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.840> try<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.050> get<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.410> work<00:02:50.560> done

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
little bit and try to get that work done

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620 
little bit and try to get that work done
with<00:02:51.070> latarian<00:02:51.640> Samantha<00:02:52.150> that's<00:02:52.270> what<00:02:52.510> we're

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
with latarian Samantha that's what we're

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.140 
with latarian Samantha that's what we're
going<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.810> try<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.020> do<00:02:53.260> okay<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:55.000> does

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
going to try to do okay and so what does

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.230 
going to try to do okay and so what does
this<00:02:55.270> mean<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:56.680> all<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:57.280> future<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:57.670> mean<00:02:58.090> it's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
this mean for all the future I mean it's

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.520 
this mean for all the future I mean it's
everything<00:02:58.570> going<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.840> shifting<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.500> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
everything going to be shifting to the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
everything going to be shifting to the
right<00:02:59.620> or<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.360> also<00:03:01.690> mean<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.230> maybe

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
right or will this also mean that maybe

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.370 
right or will this also mean that maybe
something<00:03:03.970> changes<00:03:04.300> in<00:03:04.420> one<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.810> perhaps

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
something changes in one of the perhaps

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.830 
something changes in one of the perhaps
the<00:03:05.680> next<00:03:05.800> mission<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.730> shortened<00:03:07.420> there<00:03:07.600> for

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the next mission is shortened there for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.810 
the next mission is shortened there for
the<00:03:08.140> rest<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.710> kind<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.100> stays<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.340> track

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
the rest of it it kind of stays on track

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.400 
the rest of it it kind of stays on track
or<00:03:09.940> does<00:03:10.750> everything<00:03:10.990> just<00:03:11.260> completely

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
or does everything just completely

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.990 
or does everything just completely
shifted<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.580> know<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.730> lot<00:03:12.940> of

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
shifted right because I know a lot of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150 
shifted right because I know a lot of
this<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.330> progress<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.810> Soyuz<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.230> scheduled

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
this the progress and Soyuz is scheduled

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.960 
this the progress and Soyuz is scheduled
months<00:03:15.700> any<00:03:16.600> bit<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.250> large<00:03:18.610> part<00:03:18.700> of

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
months any bit I think a large part of

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.630 
months any bit I think a large part of
that<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.270> still<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.650> be<00:03:20.680> determined<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.370> mean

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
that is still to be determined I mean

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.180 
that is still to be determined I mean
quite<00:03:21.850> frankly<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:23.500> know<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.770> we've<00:03:23.920> got<00:03:24.040> is

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
quite frankly you know what we've got is

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.680 
quite frankly you know what we've got is
a<00:03:24.220> good<00:03:24.459> set<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.730> planting<00:03:25.150> dates<00:03:25.330> right<00:03:25.510> now

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
a good set of planting dates right now

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.449 
a good set of planting dates right now
that<00:03:25.900> gives<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.290> entire<00:03:26.709> partnership<00:03:27.070> an

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
that gives the entire partnership an

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.449 
that gives the entire partnership an
opportunity<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.590> try<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> try<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.160> figure<00:03:30.310> out

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
opportunity to try to try to figure out

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.340 
opportunity to try to try to figure out
how<00:03:30.670> best<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.090> use<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.390> resources<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:32.020> orbit

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
how best to use the resources on orbit

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.710 
how best to use the resources on orbit
plus<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:32.830> ready<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.160> go<00:03:33.280> figure<00:03:34.239> out<00:03:34.420> when<00:03:34.600> we

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
plus get ready to go figure out when we

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.830 
plus get ready to go figure out when we
need<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.989> fly<00:03:35.170> fly<00:03:35.739> things<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:37.000> when<00:03:37.720> it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
need to fly fly things and so when it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.190 
need to fly fly things and so when it
comes<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.950> longer-term<00:03:39.570> schedule<00:03:40.570> for

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
comes to to the longer-term schedule for

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.690 
comes to to the longer-term schedule for
our<00:03:41.290> Russian<00:03:41.620> colleagues<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.250> how<00:03:42.340> they<00:03:42.520> want

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
our Russian colleagues and how they want

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000 
our Russian colleagues and how they want
to<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.840> put<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.170> schedule<00:03:44.560> together<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.920> think

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
to to put that schedule together I think

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.290 
to to put that schedule together I think
really<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.489> lot<00:03:45.700> that's<00:03:45.850> going<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.180> driven

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
really a lot that's going to be driven

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.729 
really a lot that's going to be driven
by<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.750> they<00:03:46.840> find<00:03:46.989> in<00:03:47.260> their<00:03:47.380> root<00:03:47.530> cause

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
by what they find in their root cause

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.040 
by what they find in their root cause
analysis<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.580> we'll<00:03:49.209> work<00:03:49.390> with<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.690> dates<00:03:49.870> of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
analysis so we'll work with the dates of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.290 
analysis so we'll work with the dates of
giving<00:03:50.320> us<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.650> think<00:03:50.680> we<00:03:51.030> will<00:03:52.030> have<00:03:52.090> a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
giving us and I think we will have a

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.510 
giving us and I think we will have a
good<00:03:52.450> plan<00:03:52.660> okay<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.010> what<00:03:54.370> are<00:03:54.430> we

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
good plan okay and so what are we

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.660 
good plan okay and so what are we
looking<00:03:54.550> at<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.150> next<00:03:55.450> Soyuz<00:03:56.350> launch<00:03:56.670> at

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
looking at for the next Soyuz launch at

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.270 
looking at for the next Soyuz launch at
this<00:03:57.910> point<00:03:58.209> we're<00:03:58.810> looking<00:03:59.080> at<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.410> end<00:04:00.190> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
this point we're looking at the end of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.610 
this point we're looking at the end of
end<00:04:00.580> of<00:04:00.700> july<00:04:00.970> timeframe<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.810> middle<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
end of july timeframe the middle to the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.880 
end of july timeframe the middle to the
end<00:04:02.770> of<00:04:03.160> july<00:04:03.459> timeframe<00:04:04.030> which<00:04:04.770> when<00:04:05.770> you

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
end of july timeframe which when you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.130 
end of july timeframe which when you
consider<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:07.270> time<00:04:07.510> frame<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.930> will<00:04:08.020> be

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
consider that that time frame it will be

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.800 
consider that that time frame it will be
shortly<00:04:08.709> before<00:04:09.130> we<00:04:09.280> have<00:04:09.459> an<00:04:10.180> HTV<00:04:10.780> vehicle

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
shortly before we have an HTV vehicle

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.680 
shortly before we have an HTV vehicle
show<00:04:11.380> up<00:04:11.790> will<00:04:12.790> most<00:04:12.970> likely<00:04:13.180> still<00:04:13.540> have

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
show up will most likely still have

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.740 
show up will most likely still have
space<00:04:13.870> x<00:04:14.140> 7<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.530> board<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:15.700> it'll<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.540> great

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
space x 7 on board and so it'll be great

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.659 
space x 7 on board and so it'll be great
to<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.530> have<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> extra<00:04:17.980> crew<00:04:18.220> show<00:04:18.430> up<00:04:18.549> in

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
to to have the extra crew show up in

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.190 
to to have the extra crew show up in
that<00:04:18.790> time<00:04:19.000> frame<00:04:19.030> bowl<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.660> will<00:04:19.930> put<00:04:20.109> them

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
that time frame bowl that will put them

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.900 
that time frame bowl that will put them
to<00:04:20.290> work<00:04:20.470> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
to work and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.620 
to work and
will<00:04:21.540> do<00:04:21.660> as<00:04:21.750> much<00:04:21.930> as<00:04:21.959> we<00:04:22.110> can<00:04:22.350> do<00:04:23.300> as<00:04:24.300> far<00:04:24.570> as

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
will do as much as we can do as far as

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.270 
will do as much as we can do as far as
when<00:04:25.230> they'll<00:04:25.440> return<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.980> whether<00:04:26.100> or<00:04:26.190> not

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
when they'll return and whether or not

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.830 
when they'll return and whether or not
that<00:04:26.490> will<00:04:26.580> affect<00:04:26.940> their<00:04:27.090> their<00:04:27.510> return

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
that will affect their their return

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.150 
that will affect their their return
schedule<00:04:28.110> based<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.680> when<00:04:28.860> they<00:04:28.980> actually

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
schedule based on when they actually

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.190 
schedule based on when they actually
launched<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.850> again<00:04:30.630> we'll<00:04:30.780> just<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.110> wait

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
launched a again we'll just have to wait

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.540 
launched a again we'll just have to wait
and<00:04:31.260> see<00:04:31.380> where<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> Russian<00:04:31.950> colleagues<00:04:32.160> end

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
and see where a Russian colleagues end

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.510 
and see where a Russian colleagues end
up<00:04:32.700> on<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.060> okay<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.050> also<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:37.010> also<00:04:38.010> i'm

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
up on that okay and also so also i'm

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.800 
up on that okay and also so also i'm
trying<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:38.790> think<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:39.030> what<00:04:39.090> i<00:04:39.150> was<00:04:39.300> thinking

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
trying to think of what i was thinking

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.180 
trying to think of what i was thinking
of<00:04:39.900> yes<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:40.890> also<00:04:41.100> with<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:42.680> soyuz<00:04:43.680> being

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
of yes so also with the the soyuz being

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.720 
of yes so also with the the soyuz being
delayed<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.610> on<00:04:44.880> until<00:04:45.720> july<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.080> said<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:47.100> the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
delayed on on until july you said so the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.420 
delayed on on until july you said so the
progress<00:04:48.000> 60<00:04:48.720> was<00:04:49.380> originally<00:04:49.980> scheduled<00:04:50.400> to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
progress 60 was originally scheduled to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.420 
progress 60 was originally scheduled to
be<00:04:50.640> launching<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.800> august<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.010> that's<00:04:53.220> been

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
be launching in august so that's been

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.430 
be launching in august so that's been
accelerated<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.390> explain<00:04:54.720> what<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
accelerated can you explain what the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920 
accelerated can you explain what the
reason<00:04:55.710> was<00:04:55.740> behind<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:57.060> bet<00:04:57.300> when<00:04:57.810> you

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
reason was behind that you bet when you

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.080 
reason was behind that you bet when you
look<00:04:58.110> at<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.440> at<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.190> commonality<00:04:59.940> between

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
look at the at the commonality between

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.410 
look at the at the commonality between
the<00:05:00.660> launchers<00:05:01.530> for<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:02.790> progress<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.360> the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
the launchers for the progress and the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.250 
the launchers for the progress and the
soyuz<00:05:04.580> certainly<00:05:05.660> certainly<00:05:06.660> before<00:05:06.990> we

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
soyuz certainly certainly before we

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.760 
soyuz certainly certainly before we
launch<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.620> crude<00:05:08.160> vehicle<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:09.840> know<00:05:09.960> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
launch a crude vehicle you know it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.500 
launch a crude vehicle you know it
probably<00:05:10.980> makes<00:05:11.310> better<00:05:11.550> sense<00:05:11.670> to<00:05:12.120> say<00:05:12.270> let's

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
probably makes better sense to say let's

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.150 
probably makes better sense to say let's
watch<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.840> cargo<00:05:13.140> vehicle<00:05:13.560> using<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:13.950> same

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
watch a cargo vehicle using that same

watch a cargo vehicle using that same
launcher<00:05:14.670> ensure<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.630> whatever

launcher ensure that whatever

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.810 
launcher ensure that whatever
corrections<00:05:16.560> whatever<00:05:16.950> things<00:05:17.460> they've<00:05:17.670> been

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
corrections whatever things they've been

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.220 
corrections whatever things they've been
able<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.090> determine<00:05:18.300> through<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.810> commission

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
able to determine through the commission

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.350 
able to determine through the commission
that<00:05:19.260> they<00:05:19.530> wanted<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:19.890> repair<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.940> all

that they wanted to repair that all
those<00:05:21.570> have<00:05:21.840> been<00:05:22.020> have<00:05:22.830> been<00:05:22.860> factored<00:05:23.460> in

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
those have been have been factored in

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.720 
those have been have been factored in
and<00:05:24.060> test<00:05:25.020> them<00:05:25.170> against<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.590> cargo<00:05:26.250> vehicle<00:05:26.610> as

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
and test them against a cargo vehicle as

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.120 
and test them against a cargo vehicle as
opposed<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.300> crude<00:05:27.570> vehicle<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.170> so<00:05:28.320> we

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
opposed to a crude vehicle and so we

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.470 
opposed to a crude vehicle and so we
think<00:05:29.160> it's<00:05:29.460> prudent<00:05:29.670> we<00:05:29.910> support<00:05:30.330> their
