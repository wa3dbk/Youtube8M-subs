unbleached white flour you could use

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
unbleached white flour you could use
wholemeal<00:01:16.500> flour<00:01:16.530> give<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> heavier<00:01:17.970> loaf

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
wholemeal flour give you a heavier loaf

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.830 
wholemeal flour give you a heavier loaf
I<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.400> flour<00:01:20.659> pour<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I then make a well in the flour pour in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.039 
I then make a well in the flour pour in
that<00:01:22.020> yeasty<00:01:22.680> brew<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:24.000> smells<00:01:24.540> fabulous<00:01:25.320> and

water and I mix all this in well the
amounts<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.119> exact<00:01:42.509> because

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
amounts don't have to be exact because

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
amounts don't have to be exact because
if<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.290> mixture<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> too<00:01:43.740> sloppy<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> add

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
if the mixture is too sloppy we can add

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969 
if the mixture is too sloppy we can add
flour<00:01:45.360> later<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.170> too<00:01:46.290> dry<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.950> can

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
flour later and if it's too dry we can

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
flour later and if it's too dry we can
simply<00:01:47.490> add<00:01:47.670> water<00:01:50.570> once<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.750> mixed<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
simply add water once it's mixed I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.740 
simply add water once it's mixed I
simply<00:01:52.710> cover<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> damp<00:01:53.729> towel<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> leave

simply cover with a damp towel and leave

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
simply cover with a damp towel and leave
it<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> prove<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> warm<00:01:55.740> place<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.640> an

hour it needs to double in size and that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.889 
hour it needs to double in size and that
will<00:01:59.759> usually<00:01:59.909> take<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.390> hour<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> could
