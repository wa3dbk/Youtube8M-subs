00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and that's how you basically make it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
and that's how you basically make it
through<00:02:17.560> each<00:02:17.800> level<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:19.300> levels<00:02:19.690> can

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
through each level the levels can

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.270 
through each level the levels can
include<00:02:20.230> different<00:02:20.530> things<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.130> can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
possibly two other and then as you see

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.619 
possibly two other and then as you see
here<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.459> can<00:02:27.579> also<00:02:27.730> include<00:02:28.180> another

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
same time so this game is like a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
same time so this game is like a
strategy<00:02:44.409> game<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.769> very<00:02:44.980> challenging<00:02:45.250> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
strategy game it's very challenging it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.119 
strategy game it's very challenging it
takes<00:02:45.969> a<00:02:46.120> while<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.629> learn<00:02:47.439> how<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.739> win<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
takes a while to learn how to win the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.459 
takes a while to learn how to win the
different<00:02:48.459> levels<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.389> still<00:02:49.900> does<00:02:50.169> it<00:02:50.349> in

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:50.469 
different levels but it still does it in

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.409 
different levels but it still does it in
this<00:02:50.620> unique<00:02:51.010> fast<00:02:51.519> way<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:52.090> makes<00:02:52.299> it

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
this unique fast way that makes it

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.050 
this unique fast way that makes it
really<00:02:52.719> really<00:02:52.870> fun<00:02:53.439> I<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:54.549> enjoyed<00:02:54.879> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
game for hours upon end as far as

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.909 
game for hours upon end as far as
graphics<00:02:58.719> go<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.169> game<00:02:59.379> is<00:02:59.530> nothing

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
graphics go this game is nothing

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.189 
graphics go this game is nothing
earth-shattering<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.819> is<00:03:00.939> HD<00:03:01.449> for<00:03:01.719> the<00:03:01.810> iPad

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
earth-shattering it is HD for the iPad

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.439 
earth-shattering it is HD for the iPad
and<00:03:02.409> so<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.680> does<00:03:02.889> look<00:03:03.129> very<00:03:03.159> nice<00:03:03.579> but<00:03:04.419> I

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:04.449 
and so it does look very nice but I

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.640 
and so it does look very nice but I
actually<00:03:04.629> kind<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.079> like<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.500> traditional

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
actually kind of like the traditional

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.300 
actually kind of like the traditional
movie<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.819> art<00:03:07.449> style<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.199> used<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.799> this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
movie and art style that it used in this

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.159 
movie and art style that it used in this
game<00:03:09.549> because<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:10.000> kind<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.269> fits<00:03:10.480> maybe<00:03:11.019> an

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
game because it kind of fits maybe an

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.280 
game because it kind of fits maybe an
earthly<00:03:11.650> civilization<00:03:12.129> or<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:13.840> back<00:03:14.049> into

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
earthly civilization or going back into

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.750 
earthly civilization or going back into
ancient<00:03:14.530> times<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.219> I<00:03:15.250> thought<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.639> looked

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
ancient times so I thought it looked

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.580 
ancient times so I thought it looked
really<00:03:16.030> nice<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.689> I<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:16.780> enjoyed<00:03:17.409> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
really nice and I really enjoyed the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.399 
really nice and I really enjoyed the
graphical<00:03:18.129> art<00:03:18.340> style<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:18.969> game<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:20.109> far
