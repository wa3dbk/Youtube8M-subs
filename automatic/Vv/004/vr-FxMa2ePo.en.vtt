thread lay a nice little thread wrap all
the<00:00:39.030> way<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.269> to<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.600> base<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the way back to the base we have the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.719 
the way back to the base we have the
original<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.620> tied<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:43.920> crafts<00:00:44.430> bird

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
original one was tied with crafts bird

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.060 
original one was tied with crafts bird
this<00:00:44.909> is<00:00:45.089> actually<00:00:45.479> pseudo<00:00:45.900> hair<00:00:46.170> I've<00:00:46.589> been

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
this is actually pseudo hair I've been

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
this is actually pseudo hair I've been
using<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.670> last<00:00:47.850> couple<00:00:48.180> years<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
using this the last couple years and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
using this the last couple years and
actually<00:00:48.659> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.199> better<00:00:49.559> than

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually kind of like it better than

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.640 
actually kind of like it better than
then<00:00:50.280> crapper<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.080> main<00:00:52.290> reasons

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
then crapper and one of the main reasons

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.549 
then crapper and one of the main reasons
is<00:00:52.799> that<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.930> consistency<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.080> fiber<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
is that the consistency of the fiber is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.420 
is that the consistency of the fiber is
real<00:00:56.150> even<00:00:57.150> it's<00:00:57.659> even<00:00:58.080> more<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.589> even<00:00:59.220> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
real even it's even more it's even more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.630 
real even it's even more it's even more
even<00:00:59.909> than<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.930> crapper<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.309> don't<00:01:02.489> have

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
even than the crapper and you don't have

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.280 
even than the crapper and you don't have
to<00:01:02.760> pick<00:01:02.970> out<00:01:03.119> a<00:01:03.150> bunch<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.600> under<00:01:03.869> fur<00:01:04.080> or

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to pick out a bunch of the under fur or

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
to pick out a bunch of the under fur or
pull<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> bunch<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.129> long<00:01:05.309> stuff

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
pull a bunch of the really long stuff

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
pull a bunch of the really long stuff
out<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.970> got<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> cool<00:01:06.510> natural<00:01:07.020> taper<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
out it's got a cool natural taper the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
out it's got a cool natural taper the
other<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.310> i<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.549> about<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.450> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
other thing i like about is that if you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
other thing i like about is that if you
don't<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> trim<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.950> scissors<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
don't want to trim it with scissors you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't want to trim it with scissors you
don't<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.900> pull

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
don't have to you actually can just pull

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.349 
don't have to you actually can just pull
the<00:01:13.200> fibers<00:01:13.619> off<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> I've<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> length<00:01:15.990> here

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
the fibers off so I've got a length here

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.109 
the fibers off so I've got a length here
of<00:01:18.359> about<00:01:18.829> two<00:01:19.829> and<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> half<00:01:20.039> three<00:01:20.340> inches<00:01:20.820> we

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
of about two and a half three inches we

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
of about two and a half three inches we
can<00:01:21.240> always<00:01:21.390> trim<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:21.899> afterwards<00:01:22.770> but

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
can always trim that down afterwards but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.330 
can always trim that down afterwards but
I<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.280> tie<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:25.340> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I will tie that in right at the end this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
I will tie that in right at the end this
is<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.609> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> tail<00:01:27.119> section<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:30.710> do

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is going to be the tail section I do

more<00:02:16.200> motion<00:02:16.710> at<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.980> back<00:02:17.250> end<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.670> fly

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
more motion at the back end of the fly

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.089 
more motion at the back end of the fly
and<00:02:20.760> great<00:02:21.090> colors<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.510> shrimp<00:02:22.110> patterns<00:02:22.530> you

and great colors for shrimp patterns you
know

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
know

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
know
the<00:02:23.840> golden<00:02:24.840> brown<00:02:25.110> two-tone<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.409> single

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the golden brown two-tone just a single

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.820 
the golden brown two-tone just a single
wrap<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.400> will<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.659> wonders<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
wrap of that will will do wonders it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.380 
wrap of that will will do wonders it
also<00:02:32.099> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> covers<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:32.940> thread<00:02:33.180> wrap

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
also kind of covers up your thread wrap

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.119 
also kind of covers up your thread wrap
so<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:33.750> makes<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.049> little<00:02:34.110> bit<00:02:34.319> neater<00:02:34.680> looking

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
so it makes a little bit neater looking

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:51.680 
so it makes a little bit neater looking

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
way around the hook and that way I can

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.370 
way around the hook and that way I can
get<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.459> legs<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.880> kind<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> flare<00:03:22.300> out

365<00:03:23.380> or<00:03:23.620> 360<00:03:24.220> degrees<00:03:24.520> around<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:26.700> then<00:03:27.700> we're

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
365 or 360 degrees around it then we're

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.840 
365 or 360 degrees around it then we're
going<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.030> create<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.570> body<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.459> the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
going to create the body and this is the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.250 
going to create the body and this is the
EP<00:03:31.720> tarantula<00:03:32.470> fibers<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:34.660> easy<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.110> work

EP tarantula fibers really easy to work
with<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.560> kind<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.070> cool<00:03:36.190> material<00:03:36.550> lots<00:03:37.060> of

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
with and kind of a cool material lots of

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.960 
with and kind of a cool material lots of
movement<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:38.650> basically<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.250> dubbing<00:03:39.730> built

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
movement with basically a dubbing built

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.270 
movement with basically a dubbing built
in<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.540> know<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.560> body<00:03:41.860> material

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
in so you know it is a body material

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:52.780 
in so you know it is a body material
that<00:03:42.640> moves<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.090> crazy

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.550 

it's<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> wire<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:54.660> basically<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it's on a wire so basically like a

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.900 
it's on a wire so basically like a
chenille<00:03:55.890> you're<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.580> wrap<00:03:56.700> that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
chenille you're just going to wrap that

chenille you're just going to wrap that
forward<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.540> original<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:58.020> was<00:03:58.200> tied<00:03:58.470> with

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
forward the original one was tied with

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.020 
forward the original one was tied with
one's<00:03:59.910> name<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.270> product<00:04:00.720> remember<00:04:01.560> that

body fur which is good stuff too but it

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.460 
body fur which is good stuff too but it
doesn't<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.850> near<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:09.210> much<00:04:09.450> movement<00:04:09.990> as

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
doesn't have near as much movement as

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.980 
doesn't have near as much movement as
this<00:04:10.710> material<00:04:11.280> does<00:04:11.520> it's<00:04:12.510> very<00:04:12.720> durable

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
this material does it's very durable

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.690 
this material does it's very durable
step<00:04:13.440> 2<00:04:13.650> with<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.830> wire<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.580> other

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
step 2 with a wire that's the other

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.370 
step 2 with a wire that's the other
thing<00:04:14.850> too<00:04:15.210> yeah<00:04:15.450> this<00:04:15.720> stuff<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.020> something

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
thing too yeah this stuff is something

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.200 
thing too yeah this stuff is something
that<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.770> think<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:17.010> will<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.550> know<00:04:17.670> take

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.240 
that I think this will you know take
toothy<00:04:18.660> bites<00:04:18.870> from<00:04:19.080> cudas<00:04:19.530> or<00:04:19.710> whatever<00:04:19.980> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
toothy bites from cudas or whatever and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
stand a little bit of a chance if you

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.150
