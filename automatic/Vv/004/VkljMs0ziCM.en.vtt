00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
different parts of it a try on today

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
different parts of it a try on today
the<00:00:09.719> first<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.559> panty<00:00:10.950> liner<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the first one is a panty liner this is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.600 
the first one is a panty liner this is
an<00:00:11.700> Enzo<00:00:12.150> Venza<00:00:12.620> organic<00:00:13.620> cotton<00:00:14.009> 7<00:00:14.490> inch

an Enzo Venza organic cotton 7 inch
panty<00:00:14.969> liner<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> chose<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:15.960> because

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
panty liner and I chose this one because

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.080 
panty liner and I chose this one because
7<00:00:16.680> inches<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.100> around<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> average<00:00:17.850> length

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
7 inches is around the average length

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790 
7 inches is around the average length
that<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.539> use<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:19.050> panty<00:00:19.380> liner<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that we would use for a panty liner and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
that we would use for a panty liner and
also<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.699> kind<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> average<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.109> thickness

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
also it's kind of average in thickness

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.769 
also it's kind of average in thickness
it<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:23.310> thin<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.119> most<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.480> panty

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
it is really thin but most of my panty

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870 
it is really thin but most of my panty
lines<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> thickness<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.099> decided<00:00:26.760> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
lines are this thickness so I decided it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.130 
lines are this thickness so I decided it
was<00:00:26.970> probably<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.300> best<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:27.869> for

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
was probably the best one to use for

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.550 
was probably the best one to use for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
creations by 5 heavy Flo the reason I
chose<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> lot

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
chose this one is because it's a lot

chose this one is because it's a lot
thicker<00:01:02.340> than<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> other<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.300> really

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
thicker than all the other so I'm really

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210
