 if at all and if so with which 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.609
 technology carried out the grassland care 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.279
 will be very strong on the philosophy 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 of the farmer depending on the machine test 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 we have become the most common 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 process grouting rolling and mulching 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.750
 Three devices from the manufacturer Sapphire and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.750
 already seen 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.610
 whether the classic simple ones 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 already used as a care device 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.630
 can be viewed 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.460
 about it can be discussed is fact 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.530
 that through the good plan their 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.860
 characteristics of mole heap or horny 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.030
 be leveled and with it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.610
 Contaminations in the feed at the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.890
 later man will be reduced 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.870
 comb out old grasses or that 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.600
 aerate the grass scar are with it however 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.510
 only conditionally possible in our machines 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.330
 We tested ourselves with the gs 802 of 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.220
 gets sapphire care one considered the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.560
 a good middle ground between the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 working a trailing and a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 Profi Greensland Striegel It works 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.360
 the income framework with the double 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.530
 embarrassed rail is largely of 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.479
 the lump taken 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.460
 in accra point is the device 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.530
 saves space and transports the field 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.840
 the stable hinges are hinged 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.580
 against dirt entry during work 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.250
 through an upstream plate 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.320
 protected lanier cakes make for a 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.549
 better contour leadership at the eight 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 meter meshes we have ours 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.659
 test machine both before and after 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.520
 the first green cut on 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.789
 tried different surfaces 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.550
 The four-row box is from 98 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.509
 tines with a distance of 8 cm 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.210
 built up 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.950
 the far larger distance is clear 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.929
 an important distinction to that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 grassland grouting other manufacturers 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.470
 Nevertheless, we were with the working picture 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.259
 quite satisfied 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.989
 with good surface performance can be with 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.420
 the gs 802 is a good aeration and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.459
 Bestockung effect of the grassy grass as well 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.340
 achieve as the satisfactory 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.739
 comb out moss and old glass the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 combination with the established seeding 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.810
 So device makes quite close 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.840
 the seeding device from ATV is easy 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.880
 to use 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.770
 over the small operated part are the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.690
 Downforce robe with the deploy amounts 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.780
 or the emptying of the container 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.300
 controlled the seed container almost 300 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.730
 liter the tax fan is about one 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.920
 3-pin socket electrically operated 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.540
 and transports the seed to eight 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.530
 small plump plates along the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.530
 sink foremost 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.610
 our conclusion to the test machine even though 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.530
 the sapphire gs 802 is not quite up to it 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.780
 working picture of real grassland 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.880
 The device has come through 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.830
 the area performance and the processing 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.080
 leave a very good impression 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.420
 from the manufacturer is this described 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.940
 middle way quite wanted especially 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 priced, the gs 802 is a real one 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.290
 alternative and could be the one or the other 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.450
 other agricultural convince his 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.540
 Care technology to a new level 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.540
 to lead 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.350
 Let's get to our next test device 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.350
 he also rolls fg 276 from 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.690
 Sapphire after winter it is recommended 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.640
 especially very humus and frozen 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.650
 floors to roll the water 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.500
 guiding properties are improved 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.810
 as well as the bestockung excited important 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.810
 the right time is neither too wet 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.950
 the surfaces are still too dry 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.190
 our test machine with one 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.530
 working width of 276 decreed in 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.440
 filled condition about a very good 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.440
 use weight of nearly 5500 kilograms 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.750
 The road transport of meadows rolls 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.880
 is a big purchase decision 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.500
 The subject is often used in machines 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.720
 be acquired 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.060
 Also on our test operation would be one 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.400
 reasonable use of the device without 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.950
 the chassis could not be displayed 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.620
 this one has a 2 circle 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.890
 Compressed air brake system and comes from the factory 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.690
 with TÃœV approval and operating license 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.180
 a popular extra for hilly 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.510
 Regions is also the hydraulic band 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.510
 brake 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.909
 as the third machine we have to 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.759
 end of the grassland season with the 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.689
 mulchgerÃ¤t mammut 280 polish 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.460
 have concerned among other things manufacturer 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.189
 we get up to dull after 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.869
 grazed pastures are used here 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.939
 can be mulcher with the mallet 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:09.909
 make horny and weed nests good 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.860
 edit these borders or dig 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.800
 We knew but also without 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.930
 sorrow drive small branches or stones 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.930
 go through the machine without problems 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.100
 for the property maintenance is the 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.010
 hydraulic sides feed by 50 cm 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.970
 Ideal the thousands PTO on the tractor 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.970
 is required 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.210
 for the mulching of corn stubble surfaces 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.980
 would be the combination with a hack 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.170
 certainly predestined 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.820
 But even so was the conversion of 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.480
 stern on the front operation well 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.830
 try this worked out quickly 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.690
 this will be the two-bolt 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.090
 Fixed carriers for the upper handlebar 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.380
 Tacked and the PTO on the 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.380
 other side changed 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.889
 more impressions to ours 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.129
 editors tried grassland care 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.219
 read devices in agrarian technology 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:21.319
 Issue february 2015 the test of a 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:25.059
 you will find collector's large-area mower 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.059
