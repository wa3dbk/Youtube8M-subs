it's not dirt it's just a cat pieces a
few<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.660> pieces<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.260> couldn't<00:02:24.620> remove<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
few of the pieces I couldn't remove the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.770 
few of the pieces I couldn't remove the
dirt<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.700> was<00:02:25.820> like<00:02:25.910> ingrained<00:02:26.450> into

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
dirt because it was like ingrained into

the<00:02:26.960> plastic<00:02:27.200> however<00:02:28.160> for<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.180> most<00:02:29.390> part<00:02:29.600> I

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the plastic however for the most part I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
the plastic however for the most part I
was<00:02:29.870> able<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.260> remove<00:02:30.590> most<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> dirt

was able to remove most of the dirt
there's<00:02:32.240> an<00:02:32.390> example<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.890> dirt<00:02:34.130> kind<00:02:34.430> of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
there's an example of the dirt kind of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.000 
there's an example of the dirt kind of
being<00:02:34.750> encrusted<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> puzzle<00:02:36.500> so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
being encrusted into the puzzle so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
being encrusted into the puzzle so
looking<00:02:37.340> at<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.580> pieces<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> puzzle

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.080 

there<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.930> really<00:02:42.350> nothing<00:02:43.010> special<00:02:43.280> about

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
there is really nothing special about

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.080 
there is really nothing special about
these<00:02:44.540> pieces<00:02:44.930> compared<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.790> normal

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
these pieces compared to the normal

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.160 
these pieces compared to the normal
sized<00:02:47.300> fangshi<00:02:49.330> pretty<00:02:50.330> much<00:02:50.480> an<00:02:50.660> exact<00:02:50.930> same

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
sized fangshi pretty much an exact same

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.470 
sized fangshi pretty much an exact same
thing<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.680> little<00:02:52.580> trick<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.180> for<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
thing a little trick I have for a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.090 
thing a little trick I have for a
completely<00:02:53.810> disassembling<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.830> corner

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
completely disassembling the corner

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000 
completely disassembling the corner
piece<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.670> simply<00:02:56.380> putting<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.560> piece<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
piece is simply putting the piece on the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.380 
piece is simply putting the piece on the
table<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.820> pushing<00:02:59.450> down<00:02:59.480> and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
table like this and pushing down and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.570 
table like this and pushing down and
then<00:03:02.470> eventually<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.890> piece<00:03:04.160> will<00:03:04.310> pop<00:03:04.550> up

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
then eventually this piece will pop up

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.100 
then eventually this piece will pop up
and<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:06.440> cap<00:03:06.739> will<00:03:07.100> come<00:03:07.130> off<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:10.930> then<00:03:11.930> you

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
and the cap will come off and then you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.580 
and the cap will come off and then you
will<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.350> able<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:13.180> disassemble<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.750> then

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
will be able to disassemble it and then

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.220 
will be able to disassemble it and then
looking<00:03:15.890> at<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.220> edge<00:03:16.459> piece<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.959> like<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
these pieces they fit together perfectly

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.830 
these pieces they fit together perfectly
together<00:04:00.349> i<00:04:00.800> also<00:04:01.520> have<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.819> trick<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.270> i<00:04:02.540> use

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
together i also have a trick that i use

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.990 
together i also have a trick that i use
for<00:04:04.660> getting<00:04:05.660> these<00:04:05.810> center<00:04:06.230> caps<00:04:06.470> off

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
for getting these center caps off

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.120 
for getting these center caps off
because<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.390> be<00:04:08.420> quite<00:04:08.720> tricky<00:04:09.130> seeing

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
because they can be quite tricky seeing

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.800 
because they can be quite tricky seeing
as<00:04:10.989> they<00:04:11.989> are<00:04:12.170> kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.940> inside<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.540> piece

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
as they are kind of inside of the piece

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.509 
as they are kind of inside of the piece
unlike<00:04:15.349> most<00:04:15.380> center<00:04:15.950> cap<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.370> can<00:04:16.489> just

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
unlike most center cap so you can just

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.349 
unlike most center cap so you can just
pop<00:04:16.970> off<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.590> once<00:04:18.769> wreck<00:04:18.980> i<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.609> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
pop off so once wreck i have is that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.909 
pop off so once wreck i have is that
there's<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.780> little<00:04:20.930> notch<00:04:21.290> right<00:04:21.560> there<00:04:21.769> on

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
there's this little notch right there on

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.240 
there's this little notch right there on
each<00:04:22.100> side<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:25.540> what<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.570> do<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.770> take<00:04:28.010> like

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
each side and what I do is I take like

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.570 
each side and what I do is I take like
any<00:04:28.490> kind<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.240> small<00:04:29.660> object<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.250> able<00:04:31.400> to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
any kind of small object that is able to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.740 
any kind of small object that is able to
jam<00:04:31.850> itself<00:04:32.270> in<00:04:32.450> there<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.139> I<00:04:34.130> push<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.479> cap

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
jam itself in there and I push the cap

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:46.930 
jam itself in there and I push the cap
off<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:39.620> remove<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.610> cap<00:04:45.430> okay<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.729> would

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
off and I remove the cap okay so I would

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.379 
off and I remove the cap okay so I would
HIGHLY<00:04:47.360> highly<00:04:47.389> recommend<00:04:48.320> miss<00:04:48.500> cube<00:04:48.860> as<00:04:49.040> a

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
HIGHLY highly recommend miss cube as a

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.300 
HIGHLY highly recommend miss cube as a
one-handed<00:04:50.389> name<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.800> has<00:04:51.950> the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
one-handed name I think it has the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.830 
one-handed name I think it has the
perfect<00:04:53.139> control<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:54.470> speed<00:04:55.040> 40<00:04:55.820> h<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.570> not

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
perfect control and speed 40 h it's not

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.550 
perfect control and speed 40 h it's not
too<00:04:57.110> fast<00:04:57.410> so<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:57.979> it's<00:04:58.100> uncontrollable<00:04:58.550> and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
too fast so that it's uncontrollable and

oah mean definitely pick this cuba but

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.950 
oah mean definitely pick this cuba but
even<00:05:09.979> if<00:05:10.100> you're<00:05:10.280> looking<00:05:10.580> for<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.940> new<00:05:11.660> main

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
even if you're looking for a new main

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.750 
even if you're looking for a new main
for<00:05:12.350> two-handed<00:05:12.860> i<00:05:13.039> would<00:05:13.190> also<00:05:13.370> highly

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
for two-handed i would also highly

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.750 
for two-handed i would also highly
recommend<00:05:14.330> this<00:05:14.450> I<00:05:14.630> think<00:05:15.169> this<00:05:15.289> cube<00:05:15.760> serves

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
recommend this I think this cube serves

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.130 
recommend this I think this cube serves
a<00:05:17.200> great<00:05:18.789> two-handed<00:05:19.789> main<00:05:19.970> as<00:05:20.150> well<00:05:20.390> I<00:05:20.660> think

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
a great two-handed main as well I think

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.990 
a great two-handed main as well I think
it<00:05:21.380> could<00:05:21.500> be<00:05:21.650> both<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:22.070> great<00:05:22.370> one<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.700> a<00:05:22.820> cube

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
it could be both a great one and a cube

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.279 
it could be both a great one and a cube
and<00:05:23.210> two-handed<00:05:23.750> cube<00:05:24.639> this<00:05:25.639> cube<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.180> not<00:05:27.080> too

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
and two-handed cube this cube is not too

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.800 
and two-handed cube this cube is not too
fast<00:05:27.530> not<00:05:27.770> too<00:05:27.889> slow<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:29.270> then<00:05:29.419> again<00:05:29.539> that

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
fast not too slow but then again that

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.020 
fast not too slow but then again that
also<00:05:30.050> depends<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.470> tensions<00:05:30.770> but<00:05:31.280> even<00:05:31.850> when

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
also depends on tensions but even when

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.060 
also depends on tensions but even when
pretty<00:05:32.780> list<00:05:33.050> tensions<00:05:33.410> this<00:05:33.560> cube<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:33.889> not

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
pretty list tensions this cube is not

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.490 
pretty list tensions this cube is not
too<00:05:34.370> fast<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:35.090> think<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.020> has<00:05:36.139> the<00:05:36.289> perfect

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
too fast I think it has the perfect

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.320 
too fast I think it has the perfect
amount<00:05:36.710> in<00:05:36.950> control<00:05:37.310> especially<00:05:37.970> if<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.210> or

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
amount in control especially if you or

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.879 
amount in control especially if you or
somebody<00:05:38.539> who's<00:05:38.750> working<00:05:39.139> on<00:05:39.229> look<00:05:39.590> ahead

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
somebody who's working on look ahead

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.310 
somebody who's working on look ahead
which<00:05:40.669> is<00:05:40.850> what<00:05:41.300> i<00:05:41.330> am<00:05:41.450> doing<00:05:41.780> at<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> current

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
which is what i am doing at the current

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.540 
which is what i am doing at the current
moment<00:05:42.440> I'm<00:05:42.710> working<00:05:42.830> on<00:05:43.070> looking<00:05:43.430> ahead

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
moment I'm working on looking ahead

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.520 
moment I'm working on looking ahead
because<00:05:43.880> that<00:05:44.479> is<00:05:44.630> basically<00:05:44.960> what<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.289> need

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
because that is basically what you need

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.820 
because that is basically what you need
to<00:05:45.710> get<00:05:45.830> a<00:05:46.330> lot<00:05:47.330> faster<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.380> I'm<00:05:48.470> trying<00:05:48.680> to

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
to get a lot faster so I'm trying to

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.469 
to get a lot faster so I'm trying to
work<00:05:48.919> on<00:05:49.130> that<00:05:49.280> right<00:05:49.490> now<00:05:49.520> so<00:05:50.090> if<00:05:50.150> you're<00:05:50.300> also

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
work on that right now so if you're also

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.870 
work on that right now so if you're also
working<00:05:50.870> on<00:05:51.110> trying<00:05:51.410> to<00:05:51.500> get<00:05:51.710> better<00:05:52.550> look

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
working on trying to get better look

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.830 
working on trying to get better look
ahead<00:05:53.180> then<00:05:53.360> I<00:05:53.479> would<00:05:53.780> recommend<00:05:54.080> this<00:05:54.320> cube<00:05:54.650> I

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
ahead then I would recommend this cube I

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.150 
ahead then I would recommend this cube I
think<00:05:56.840> it<00:05:56.930> is<00:05:57.050> better<00:05:57.500> than<00:05:57.800> the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
think it is better than the

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.450 
think it is better than the
57-millimeter<00:05:58.880> fang<00:05:59.510> xin<00:05:59.860> shrine<00:06:00.860> rent<00:06:01.190> but

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
57-millimeter fang xin shrine rent but

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.860 
57-millimeter fang xin shrine rent but
for<00:06:01.729> some<00:06:01.910> odd<00:06:01.940> reason<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:02.450> don't<00:06:02.510> know<00:06:02.750> why

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
for some odd reason I don't know why

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.740 
for some odd reason I don't know why
like<00:06:03.440> it's<00:06:04.370> kind<00:06:04.640> of<00:06:04.669> like<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.940> 55<00:06:05.360> millimeter

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
like it's kind of like the 55 millimeter

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.910 
like it's kind of like the 55 millimeter
dayan<00:06:06.140> zhanchi<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.560> don't<00:06:06.860> know<00:06:06.979> why<00:06:07.280> is<00:06:07.340> that

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
dayan zhanchi I don't know why is that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.460 
dayan zhanchi I don't know why is that
in<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.250> regular<00:06:09.000> thing<00:06:09.030> sheep<00:06:09.480> but<00:06:09.750> it<00:06:09.960> just<00:06:10.200> is

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
in a regular thing sheep but it just is

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.120 
in a regular thing sheep but it just is
so<00:06:11.280> even<00:06:12.210> if<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.420> have<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.930> regular<00:06:13.890> size

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
so even if you have the regular size

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.490 
so even if you have the regular size
