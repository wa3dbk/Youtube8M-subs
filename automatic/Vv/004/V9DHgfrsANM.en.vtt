00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.990

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 ten books and today talk about ten 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 the most interesting in my opinion begin 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.939
 with the first one she is called to play the game 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 profits but most traders 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.320
 It is the third cottage put on the first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
