different games this way and the Xbox

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.700 
different games this way and the Xbox
controller<00:00:50.670> works<00:00:51.000> great<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.020> live<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
controller works great with on live and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
controller works great with on live and
the<00:00:53.430> MK<00:00:53.760> 808<00:00:54.180> seems<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> no<00:00:55.110> problem

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

playing<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.980> videos<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> graphics<00:00:56.910> don't

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
playing the videos the graphics don't

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549

slow<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.469> they

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
slow it down at all and I think they

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
slow it down at all and I think they
look<00:00:58.739> nice<00:00:59.039> they're<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.000> full<00:01:00.390> 1080p<00:01:00.899> but

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
look nice they're not full 1080p but

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
look nice they're not full 1080p but
they<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.800> good

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
which is nice and I'm using the triggers

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
which is nice and I'm using the triggers
for<00:01:27.780> acceleration<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.829> reverse<00:01:34.640> next<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.790> we

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
for acceleration and reverse next up we

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
for acceleration and reverse next up we
have<00:01:36.000> osmosis<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.619> wanted<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> show

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
have osmosis and I just wanted to show

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
have osmosis and I just wanted to show
that<00:01:38.189> games<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.970> were<00:01:39.060> originally<00:01:39.420> designed

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that games that were originally designed

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
that games that were originally designed
for<00:01:39.960> touchscreen<00:01:40.290> phone<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.220> work

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
for touchscreen phone can work

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
for touchscreen phone can work
especially<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.570> they're<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.140> live<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
especially when they're in on live you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.880 
especially when they're in on live you
have<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> lot<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.220> chance<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.820> them<00:01:45.090> working

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
have a lot better chance of them working

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.730 
have a lot better chance of them working
and<00:01:47.090> finally<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.810> dark<00:01:49.200> sliders

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and finally we have here dark sliders

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.249 
and finally we have here dark sliders
too<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.759> game<00:01:51.060> plays<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.170> the
