00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.420
 [Music] 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.840
 now see 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.880
 [Music] 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:13.139
 To place 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 these squares coinciding with these 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.500
 as we see we have to square the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.660
 colors 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.840
 and match those who are going to this 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.960
 side in this case the green would end 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 with the orange but it's not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 the orange with the green but it is not here 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.200
 red with blue but yes it is 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.060
 so let's take this as it does if 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.100
 do not get any like we'll take 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.860
 any as in the previous step as 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.250
 well and we will perform the following 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.340
 algorithm 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.920
 we turn one towards this side 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.640
 We got est 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.489
 [Music] 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 we take the other side towards the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.440
 right 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.629
 we climb the left side of the box 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.170
 we bring the white box carrying this 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.159
 toward the left 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.159
 we go down 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.510
 we bring the other white carrying this to 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.510
 the right and we go down 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.200
 and we see that they still match 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.970
 [Music] 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.880
 this matches 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 this we must do a lot and it is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.329
 I effectively agree 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.890
 in case they did not match then 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.890
 we will repeat the process 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.420
 you can repeat the video to see the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.030
 process but it's basically we run one 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.030
 towards this side we climb this once 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.940
 we climb 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.590
 We go up 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.590
 let's say this to this side 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 we climb this side 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.380
 we have again come down 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 often and we go down 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.569
 let's see if he gives us 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.569
 red with the south 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.780
 it hurt us 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 now that repeat the process remember 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.690
 taking a side towards the one that matches 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.740
 [Music] 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.740
 we saw once 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.620
 [Music] 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 ah 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.360
 again it matches ready this is what 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.390
 we want you to know so do not be 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:09.330
 armed and we will proceed to make the last 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:12.030
 step that is to take the picture based on 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.910
 on any any side or what 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.610
 is not resolved obviously this is already 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.030
 solved may not be resolved 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.030
 none 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.290
 then we will take 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.080
 as does s 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.920
 as we said we are going to take 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.200
 already having a square the color 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.100
 colors that will go here even if they are not 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.290
 armed for example ends the red 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.129
 with the green 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.769
 out the blue with the red of each 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.620
 blue with orange this is already armed 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.260
 but I could go 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.360
 be run with anything but my 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.019
 life these two colors anyway 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 coincident we're going to take the box and 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.599
 looking like this by taking this side by taking 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.370
 a little Hindu of anyone who does not 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.650
 be solved 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.370
 [Music] 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.069
 and we will proceed to choose the article that 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.510
 I like to do alcohol again and 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.790
 we use to assemble these tips 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.739
 remember 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.050
 we work 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.080
 we come to the left we go up 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.040
 we work to the right 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.310
 and repeat until it forms 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.740
 [Music] 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.740
 we go down we take 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.650
 We went down 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.830
 we carry 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.370
 bring 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.370
 [Music] 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 we bring 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.790
 we saw that it was already armed 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.110
 without moving this let's bring this towards 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.240
 this side 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.569
 [Music] 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.220
 and we will always continue taking as a basis 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.700
 the one we already chose 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.530
 and we will repeat the process we go down and 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.530
 we carry 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.530
 3 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.900
 we went up 3 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.589
 [Music] 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.470
 we go up we bring 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.470
 we are going up 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.739
 and we bring 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.150
 does not arm 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.430
 well and zero 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.560
 yes, only Sherman is fine 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.710
 [Music] 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.650
 we will not be guided by this 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.050
 not that it is up here before 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.560
 remove it 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.759
 the same without letting go is the basis we bring 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.759
 this art 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.300
 and we repeat we take 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:22.060
 we had and trump 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.060
 we had climbed down 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.979
 we go down we carry the same 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:33.150
 and work 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.150
 we went down we arrived 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.470
 and we bring we have to be very 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.800
 completely and now you just have to do 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:48.689
 match the color that is and will remain 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.029
 fully armed 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.249
 remember that last steps have to 

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:55.669
 be the algorithm well done all the 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.669
 times 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:03.910
 if you do not make a step that is getting low 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:08.350
 go up and bring if you do not do one of those 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:11.000
 steps is going to damage the whole process and 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.910
 they will lose what they had done 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.950
 do not forget to share this 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.520
 video with your friends 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.330
 and comment if they have any questions 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.330
 see you later 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.420
