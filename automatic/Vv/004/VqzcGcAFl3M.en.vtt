00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.890 

today<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.639> want<00:00:02.759> to<00:00:02.880> take<00:00:03.029> a<00:00:03.060> look<00:00:03.270> at<00:00:03.420> the<00:00:03.630> first

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:03.900 
today I want to take a look at the first

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.199 
today I want to take a look at the first
Sharpie<00:00:04.410> pen<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.890> writing<00:00:04.919> of<00:00:05.730> course<00:00:05.939> I<00:00:06.029> want

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:06.209 
Sharpie pen for writing of course I want

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.090 
Sharpie pen for writing of course I want
to<00:00:06.270> see<00:00:06.359> how<00:00:06.479> well<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.689> draws<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.979> good

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
to see how well it draws one of the good

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.590 
to see how well it draws one of the good
things<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.430> this<00:00:08.760> pin<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.330> supposed<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
things about this pin is it supposed to

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.150 
things about this pin is it supposed to
be<00:00:09.690> water-resistant<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:10.950> also

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
be water-resistant and it's also

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.010 
be water-resistant and it's also
supposed<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.640> be<00:00:11.820> archival<00:00:12.600> or<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.840> least

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
supposed to be archival or at least

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.570 
supposed to be archival or at least
acid-free<00:00:13.680> anyway<00:00:14.070> which<00:00:14.280> would<00:00:14.490> hopefully

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
acid-free anyway which would hopefully

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
acid-free anyway which would hopefully
mean<00:00:15.060> that<00:00:15.600> it<00:00:15.720> would<00:00:15.840> be<00:00:15.990> archival<00:00:16.620> on

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
mean that it would be archival on

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.520 
mean that it would be archival on
acid-free<00:00:17.190> paper<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.090> let's<00:00:18.270> take<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.450> look<00:00:21.530> the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
acid-free paper so let's take a look the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.840 
acid-free paper so let's take a look the
first<00:00:22.740> thing<00:00:22.950> that<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.160> noticed<00:00:23.190> about<00:00:23.700> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
first thing that I noticed about the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
first thing that I noticed about the
Sharpie<00:00:24.240> pen<00:00:24.450> was<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.530> ink<00:00:25.830> wasn't

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
Sharpie pen was that the ink wasn't

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.370 
Sharpie pen was that the ink wasn't
quite<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.610> dark<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.030> that<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.449> might<00:00:28.110> have<00:00:28.260> hoped

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
quite as dark is that I might have hoped

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.410 
quite as dark is that I might have hoped
for<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.610> bit<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> light<00:00:30.180> side

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
for it's a little bit on the light side

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.040 
for it's a little bit on the light side
it<00:00:30.690> still<00:00:30.930> is<00:00:31.399> pretty<00:00:32.399> dark<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:32.999> not<00:00:33.449> as<00:00:33.690> dark

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it still is pretty dark but not as dark

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799 
it still is pretty dark but not as dark
as<00:00:34.409> the<00:00:35.219> India<00:00:35.550> ink<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.089> typically<00:00:36.480> load

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as the India ink that I typically load

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.319 
as the India ink that I typically load
in<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.170> kohinoor<00:00:37.710> pins<00:00:38.359> the<00:00:40.550> pin<00:00:41.550> itself<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in my kohinoor pins the pin itself the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.439 
in my kohinoor pins the pin itself the
tip<00:00:42.929> really<00:00:43.199> flows<00:00:43.499> well<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:45.059> least<00:00:45.239> on

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
tip really flows well and at least on

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.040 
tip really flows well and at least on
this<00:00:45.569> paper<00:00:45.780> anyway<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.679> a<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:47.670> nice

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
this paper anyway it's got a very nice

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.599 
this paper anyway it's got a very nice
crisp<00:00:49.050> field<00:00:49.409> to<00:00:49.589> it<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:53.039> ink<00:00:53.280> didn't

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
crisp field to it be the ink didn't

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.750 
crisp field to it be the ink didn't
bleed<00:00:53.879> any<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> paper<00:00:54.839> which<00:00:55.499> is<00:00:56.159> to

bleed any into the paper which is to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
point of some of my more expensive pins

on a lot of different types of paper
this<00:01:00.899> paper<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.190> journal<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this paper is just a journal that I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.749 
this paper is just a journal that I
found<00:01:03.269> at<00:01:03.420> borders<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.320> paper<00:01:05.039> is<00:01:05.430> pretty

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
found at borders the paper is pretty

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.690 
found at borders the paper is pretty
light<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> acid-free<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.649> it<00:01:08.369> should

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
light but it is acid-free so it should

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
light but it is acid-free so it should
be<00:01:08.729> archival<00:01:09.450> quality<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:13.610> did<00:01:14.610> find<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
be archival quality I did find that as I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
be archival quality I did find that as I
was<00:01:16.770> drawing<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.079> go<00:01:19.200> back

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
was drawing that I did want to go back

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.670 
was drawing that I did want to go back
over<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.740> few<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> lines<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.649> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
over a few of the lines to to get them a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.179 
over a few of the lines to to get them a
little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.280> darker<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.630> all<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.469> all<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.920> has

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
little bit darker but all in all it has

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.910 
little bit darker but all in all it has
a<00:01:26.219> real<00:01:26.670> nice<00:01:26.909> feel<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.469> weight<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a real nice feel to it the weight of the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.789 
a real nice feel to it the weight of the
pin<00:01:29.130> itself<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.880> nice<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.600> remarkably<00:01:31.439> light

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
pin itself is nice it's remarkably light

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
pin itself is nice it's remarkably light
and<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:34.429> pretty<00:01:35.429> well<00:01:35.640> balanced<00:01:36.149> i'd<00:01:36.270> say

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and is a pretty well balanced i'd say

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
and is a pretty well balanced i'd say
maybe<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.289> bit<00:01:37.469> heavy<00:01:38.159> towards<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> tip

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
maybe a little bit heavy towards the tip

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
maybe a little bit heavy towards the tip
but<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.840> typical<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.560> most

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
but that's a pretty typical for most

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.179 
but that's a pretty typical for most

or<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.560> maybe<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.920> point<00:02:05.280> five<00:02:05.490> five<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.359> nice

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
or so maybe a point five five so a nice

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.060 
or so maybe a point five five so a nice
kind<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.970> light<00:02:08.970> depth<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.950> all

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
kind of light depth to it but all in all

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.980 
kind of light depth to it but all in all
I'd<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.610> say<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.240> really<00:02:12.450> good

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
I'd have to say that it's a really good

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
I'd have to say that it's a really good
and<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.200> was<00:02:13.320> very<00:02:13.380> pleased<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.670> may

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and I was very pleased with it it may

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.310 
and I was very pleased with it it may
not<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.300> first<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.720> choose<00:02:16.020> but

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
not be the first one I choose but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.770 
not be the first one I choose but
certainly<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.040> would<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.180> nice<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
certainly one that would be a nice and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
certainly one that would be a nice and
expensive<00:02:18.990> pin<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.740> carry<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
expensive pin to carry with you on a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.600 
expensive pin to carry with you on a
day-to-day<00:02:20.940> basis
