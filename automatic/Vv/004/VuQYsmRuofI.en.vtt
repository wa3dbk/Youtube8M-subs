00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.759 
you think this just has to simply do
maybe<00:03:21.480> with<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:22.200> fact<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.470> he's<00:03:22.620> not

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
during games mm I mean to be honest I'm

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.450 
during games mm I mean to be honest I'm
so<00:05:24.300> like<00:05:24.630> 12<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.590> game<00:05:25.770> i<00:05:25.800> really<00:05:26.100> don't<00:05:26.280> pay

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
so like 12 the game i really don't pay

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.910 
so like 12 the game i really don't pay
attention<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.820> like<00:05:27.060> an<00:05:27.180> individual<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.990> mean<00:05:28.560> I

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
attention to like an individual I mean I

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.530 
attention to like an individual I mean I
don't<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:29.580> what<00:05:29.790> happened<00:05:30.210> with<00:05:30.360> Ruiz

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
don't know what happened with Ruiz

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.450

during<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.960> game

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
during the game

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.650 
during the game
