maybe<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.880> quite<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> funk<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.290> gonna

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
maybe not quite that funk so we're gonna

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
maybe not quite that funk so we're gonna
move<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.799> ahead<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.280> line<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
move we go ahead and line this up and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
move we go ahead and line this up and
cross<00:01:40.259> our<00:01:40.439> fingers<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.939> worked<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.329> stay

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
cross our fingers that it worked so stay

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.370 
cross our fingers that it worked so stay
tuned<00:01:43.520> well
