they're<00:05:45.220> heavily<00:05:45.730> armed<00:05:46.180> I'm<00:05:46.300> afraid<00:05:48.420> what

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
they're heavily armed I'm afraid what

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.220 
they're heavily armed I'm afraid what
about<00:05:49.510> their<00:05:49.780> battle<00:05:50.140> experience<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:52.660> six<00:05:52.990> in

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
about their battle experience the six in

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.440 
about their battle experience the six in
charge<00:05:53.560> are<00:05:53.800> plenty<00:05:54.160> tough<00:05:54.420> after<00:05:55.420> all

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
charge are plenty tough after all

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.000 
charge are plenty tough after all
they're<00:05:56.200> Foxhound<00:05:56.860> people<00:05:57.870> hey<00:05:58.870> you're<00:05:59.860> gonna

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
they're Foxhound people hey you're gonna

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.520 
they're Foxhound people hey you're gonna
make<00:06:00.280> me<00:06:00.430> blush<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:02.020> others<00:06:02.350> are

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
make me blush the others are

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.490 
make me blush the others are
next-generation<00:06:03.130> Special<00:06:04.000> Forces<00:06:04.500> they're

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
next-generation Special Forces they're

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.799 
next-generation Special Forces they're
not<00:06:05.710> your<00:06:05.920> average<00:06:06.070> grunts<00:06:06.610> either

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:10.809 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.399 

so<00:06:11.809> what<00:06:12.080> exactly<00:06:12.199> are<00:06:12.679> they<00:06:12.949> demanding<00:06:13.099> a

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
so what exactly are they demanding a

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.559 
so what exactly are they demanding a
person's<00:06:15.409> remains<00:06:16.659> remains<00:06:18.309> that's<00:06:19.309> right<00:06:19.579> to

which are responsible for making
effective<00:06:56.149> soldiers

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.200 

there<00:07:00.729> are<00:07:00.940> genes<00:07:01.330> that<00:07:01.599> do<00:07:01.900> that<00:07:02.550> yes<00:07:03.550> and

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
there are genes that do that yes and

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.570 
there are genes that do that yes and
using<00:07:04.720> gene<00:07:04.960> therapy<00:07:05.560> they're<00:07:06.190> able<00:07:06.310> to

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
using gene therapy they're able to

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.969 
using gene therapy they're able to
transplant<00:07:07.150> those<00:07:07.509> genes<00:07:08.050> into<00:07:08.740> regular

transplant those genes into regular
soldiers<00:07:11.130> gene<00:07:12.130> therapy<00:07:14.280> I'll<00:07:15.280> explain<00:07:16.210> this

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
soldiers gene therapy I'll explain this

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:22.529 
soldiers gene therapy I'll explain this
part<00:07:19.590> with<00:07:20.590> gene<00:07:20.919> therapy<00:07:20.949> it<00:07:21.699> becomes<00:07:22.180> easy

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:22.539 
part with gene therapy it becomes easy

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.749 
part with gene therapy it becomes easy
to<00:07:22.750> remove<00:07:23.080> genes<00:07:23.560> that<00:07:23.800> cause<00:07:24.009> sickness<00:07:24.460> and

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 
to remove genes that cause sickness and

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:28.290 
to remove genes that cause sickness and
disease<00:07:25.150> or<00:07:26.130> alternatively<00:07:27.130> to<00:07:27.699> splice<00:07:28.030> in

words we can overcome all sorts of
genetic<00:07:37.000> diseases<00:07:37.539> and<00:07:37.960> at<00:07:38.319> the<00:07:38.409> same<00:07:38.650> time

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
genetic diseases and at the same time

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.710 
genetic diseases and at the same time
add<00:07:39.400> genetic<00:07:40.360> characteristics<00:07:41.020> as<00:07:41.440> desired

add genetic characteristics as desired

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.379 
add genetic characteristics as desired
okay<00:07:43.720> and<00:07:44.139> so<00:07:44.710> if<00:07:44.860> you<00:07:44.979> knew<00:07:45.280> what<00:07:45.669> genes<00:07:46.060> were

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:46.389 
okay and so if you knew what genes were

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:47.909 
okay and so if you knew what genes were
responsible<00:07:47.050> for<00:07:47.289> making<00:07:47.470> the<00:07:47.710> perfect

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 
responsible for making the perfect

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.100 
responsible for making the perfect
soldier<00:07:48.310> you<00:07:49.090> could<00:07:49.240> implant<00:07:49.539> them<00:07:49.870> in<00:07:50.020> the

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110 
soldier you could implant them in the

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.050 
soldier you could implant them in the
same<00:07:50.380> way<00:07:50.620> right<00:07:51.039> yes<00:07:51.699> we<00:07:52.539> could<00:07:53.729> but<00:07:54.729> it<00:07:54.880> all

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
same way right yes we could but it all

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.390 
same way right yes we could but it all
depends<00:07:55.569> on<00:07:55.750> being<00:07:55.990> able<00:07:56.349> to<00:07:56.470> isolate<00:07:56.710> and

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 
depends on being able to isolate and

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.680 
depends on being able to isolate and
identify<00:07:57.639> those<00:07:58.419> soldier<00:07:59.139> genes<00:08:00.479> and<00:08:01.479> in

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:01.690 
identify those soldier genes and in

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.540 
identify those soldier genes and in
order<00:08:01.840> to<00:08:01.930> do<00:08:02.169> that<00:08:02.349> it's<00:08:02.740> helpful<00:08:03.039> if<00:08:03.250> you<00:08:03.400> can

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.550 
order to do that it's helpful if you can

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.520 
order to do that it's helpful if you can
study<00:08:03.880> the<00:08:04.090> genetic<00:08:04.509> information<00:08:04.810> of<00:08:05.229> one<00:08:05.440> of
