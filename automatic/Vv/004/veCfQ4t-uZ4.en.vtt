00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everybody this week I'm here in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
 U.S 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.940
 logically it is impossible not to seek 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.380
 market news . 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.880
 food implementation 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 so just as I think everyone 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.920
 sad about it or someone who likes to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 train lightly serious training to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.080
 seek improvements in relation to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 food 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 but I'm also going there 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.789
 Supplement store shelves behind 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 of news 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.779
 so something that is not so new there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 so it is already a few months in the market 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.930
 but we still do not have access in brazil 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.090
 this type of saltine is not these 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 Here potatoes enriched with protein 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.309
 So I thought the idea is super interesting. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 is something that can fit in very well 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.820
 food program mainly 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 in that transition phase of a person 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 which has an inadequate diet and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 stalin a little improving your 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 diet 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 logically a high level athlete does not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.289
 will use one of these snacks 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.539
 daily because they do not have levels 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.420
 so low in sodium, but also not 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.609
 are so high that they are 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.119
 completely avoid talking about sodium 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.189
 usually the dosage used 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.590
 In Brazil, mainly speaking our 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.500
 reality is around 12 grams per 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 most people, that is, it is a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.540
 amount much higher than it should 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.970
 being that it would be in tonality and two 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.970
 grams a day a pack of sic tem 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 about 210 milligrams of sodium or 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 not so low but also far from 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.810
 example those people who see their 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.720
 Salad there with salt 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.450
 so it's worth the snack option to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.909
 for children to take in school is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 possibly or for example that which 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.290
 really want to eat a 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.700
 A little something like chips 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.369
 without it is making a feeding 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 inadequate then it is very rich in proteins 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.460
 a low amount of carbohydrate a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 low amount of fat 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.509
 It's up to us now, I work too. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 product development then say 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.229
 we can do something similar in the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.969
 Brazil then there remains the creativity 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.740
 and the capacity of our professionals 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.840
 we worked there with the development of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 products do something similar because 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.920
 here I would not have any 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.290
 restriction in Brazilian law then 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.959
 remains the capacity of our professional 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.069
 produce the products as good as the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.000
 which are developed here in the states 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.159
 United 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.159
 A hug to everyone who cares and with the tips
