00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
very effective defense because the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
very effective defense because the
punches<00:00:57.690> were<00:00:57.840> still<00:00:58.170> clearly<00:00:59.090> bothering

chambers enough to make him not throw
punches<00:01:02.280> anymore<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.899> he<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.199> hurt<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
punches anymore I think he got hurt I

punches anymore I think he got hurt I
think<00:01:05.010> he<00:01:05.129> didn't<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> take<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> punches

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
