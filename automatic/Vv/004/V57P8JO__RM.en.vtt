00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
mother by cheetah gets involved in it so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
mother by cheetah gets involved in it so
the<00:02:11.250> next<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.180> Iron<00:02:12.660> Man<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.640> feels

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the next one is Iron Man but this feels

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.140 
the next one is Iron Man but this feels
more<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:16.500> daredevil<00:02:16.920> book<00:02:17.430> than<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.970> does

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
more like a daredevil book than it does

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.690 
more like a daredevil book than it does
actually<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:18.959> Ironman<00:02:19.830> book<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.280> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
actually an Ironman book is just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.320 
actually an Ironman book is just
daredevil<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.140> man<00:02:22.769> as<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.489> main<00:02:23.700> villain

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
daredevil with a man as the main villain

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.110 
daredevil with a man as the main villain
so<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> might<00:02:25.440> actually<00:02:25.590> drop<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.640> start

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
so I might actually drop this and start

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.770 
so I might actually drop this and start
getting<00:02:27.299> daredevil<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:29.040> next<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.579> is<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
getting daredevil the next one is the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.350 
getting daredevil the next one is the
flash<00:02:31.079> 38<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.519> course<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.540> his<00:02:34.040> 75th

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
