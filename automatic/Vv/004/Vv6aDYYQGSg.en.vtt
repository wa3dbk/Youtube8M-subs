00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.490 
thought okay Craig could you just tell
us<00:00:05.430> something<00:00:05.700> about<00:00:05.760> the<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.779> construction

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
us something about the the construction

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.810 
us something about the the construction

and what what you're seeing here is one

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.750 
and what what you're seeing here is one
of<00:00:26.880> three<00:00:27.150> custom<00:00:27.870> design<00:00:28.200> stages<00:00:28.620> that<00:00:29.430> are

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
of three custom design stages that are

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450 
of three custom design stages that are

of the last tour and challenged William
and<00:00:56.550> mark<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.910> come<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.600> design<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
and mark to come up with a design that

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.500 
and mark to come up with a design that
would<00:00:58.440> work<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.280> carry<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> type<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> weight

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
would work to carry that type of weight

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.460 
would work to carry that type of weight
for<00:01:00.810> example<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.220> current<00:01:02.640> carries<00:01:03.090> over

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
for example this current carries over

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.499 
for example this current carries over
360,000<00:01:04.470> coms<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:05.100> top<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.640> stage<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
360,000 coms over top of that stage and

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.059 
360,000 coms over top of that stage and
to<00:01:06.659> hold<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> engineering<00:01:07.530> structure<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
to hold the engineering structure of

that took a custom design and not as
half<00:01:10.079> how<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:10.979> does<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.280> cost<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:12.979> more<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
half how much does it cost me more and

half how much does it cost me more and
more<00:01:14.310> than<00:01:14.549> more<00:01:15.270> than<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.719> thinking

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
more than more than I would be thinking

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.959 
more than more than I would be thinking
about<00:01:16.139> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.859> what<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.219> it's<00:01:17.789> all<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
about if you know what it's it's all a

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.800 
about if you know what it's it's all a
business<00:01:18.469> practice<00:01:19.469> so<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.679> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.810> your

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
business practice so you look at your

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.959 
business practice so you look at your
revenues<00:01:22.200> versus<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.679> costs<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
revenues versus your costs and the

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.999 
revenues versus your costs and the
logistics<00:01:24.149> about<00:01:24.780> works<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.319> hope<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
logistics about works and hope that it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
logistics about works and hope that it
works<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.549> positive<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> band

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
works up to the positive but the band

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
works up to the positive but the band
really<00:01:28.229> has<00:01:28.409> spared<00:01:28.679> no<00:01:28.770> expense<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.369> try<00:01:29.639> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really has spared no expense to try and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
really has spared no expense to try and
give<00:01:30.389> a<00:01:30.420> design<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.889> meet

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
give a design that actually will meet

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.699 
give a design that actually will meet
those<00:01:32.399> full<00:01:32.609> needs<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.149> play<00:01:33.359> 2<00:01:33.420> 360<00:01:34.170> stadiums

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
those full needs to play 2 360 stadiums

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.199 
those full needs to play 2 360 stadiums
around<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> world<00:01:35.279> and<00:01:35.729> once<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.969> tour<00:01:36.179> is

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
around the world and once this tour is

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.239 
around the world and once this tour is
over<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.840> happens<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.679> type<00:01:37.889> of<00:01:37.920> stage

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
over what happens to this type of stage

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.609 
over what happens to this type of stage
I<00:01:38.279> mean<00:01:38.639> is<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.539> know<00:01:39.749> packed<00:01:40.109> up<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> put

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I mean is it you know packed up and put

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.440 
I mean is it you know packed up and put
in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> warehouse<00:01:41.159> somewhere<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.179> every

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
in a warehouse somewhere will have every

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
in a warehouse somewhere will have every
used<00:01:42.719> again<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.350> certainly<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
used again would certainly have to be a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.819 
used again would certainly have to be a
very<00:01:44.219> big<00:01:44.399> warehouse<00:01:44.819> we<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:45.959> we<00:01:46.740> were

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
very big warehouse we are we were

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.370 
very big warehouse we are we were
absolutely<00:01:47.299> weighing<00:01:48.299> different<00:01:48.779> ideas<00:01:49.200> at

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
absolutely weighing different ideas at

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.769 
absolutely weighing different ideas at
this<00:01:49.529> time<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.609> time<00:01:50.849> is<00:01:51.060> 18<00:01:51.420> months<00:01:51.659> ahead

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:51.779 
this time that time is 18 months ahead

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.809 
this time that time is 18 months ahead
and<00:01:51.959> I<00:01:52.349> think<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.679> have<00:01:52.709> a<00:01:52.859> bit<00:01:53.099> have<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.639> make

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
and I think we have a bit have to make

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.190 
and I think we have a bit have to make
some<00:01:54.029> of<00:01:54.179> these<00:01:54.270> schedules<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.959> to<00:01:55.079> do

some of these schedules we have to do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
some of these schedules we have to do
