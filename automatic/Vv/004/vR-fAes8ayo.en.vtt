brewing for me is awesome during a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
brewing for me is awesome during a
winter<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.500> typically<00:01:49.979> keep<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
winter because I typically keep the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.419 
winter because I typically keep the
