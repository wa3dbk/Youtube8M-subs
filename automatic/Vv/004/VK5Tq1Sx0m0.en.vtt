 police tried to crash into each other 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.489
 the player's machine instead of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.590
 simply make it stop between tests 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.210
 player had become so popular that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.880
 the game has been redesigned to give 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.770
 importance to this blitz is also said 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.540
 which made it into chase was inspired by 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 an old arcade game called abb 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 where the player uses the car of the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.580
 police and must stop the cars of the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.080
 criminals in the street 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.060
 the original design document 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.740
 dryssen chase mentions windows 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.500
 pop up that informed the player about 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.039
 events in the game and in bbc known a 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.039
 similar system 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.080
 in 2002 the development of a 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.790
 remake of gta iii had been created by 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.920
 nothing for the nes and was baptized 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.810
 grand theft end 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.850
 I had a contribution that was recreated in detail 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 in the s version the missions had been 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.540
 modified to conform to the style 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.570
 2d but all the features of gta 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.400
 iii were present machine-gun fights 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 even stores like abu nation 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.750
 the latest update on the game was 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.600
 started in 2005 and since then it seems 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.430
 forgotten some will recognize the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 graphics this because the project is 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.900
 resurrected in December 2008 col 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.970
 retro name testing for which to be 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.399
 definitively named retro city 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.500
 rampage in 2010 a game entirely 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.450
 original with quote from other days 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.550

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.959
 brian province no added creator 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.030
 characters location of other games 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.890
 he called this inspired him to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.180
 work on the project full time but 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.160
 instead of using scenarios and landscapes 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.690
 we type would have created a game 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.459
 completely new and original e 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.989
 no grand theft car game would be 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.170
 complete without some secrets and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.780
 ex star therefore without a precise order 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.150

 gta 1 and 2 game 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.150
 the images are neither animated nor 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.400
 interactive but still a nice eulogy 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.140

 an area that would never be due 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.330
 being accessible in the game was 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.000
 used as the initial video scenario 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.070
 where cloud helps catalina rob one
