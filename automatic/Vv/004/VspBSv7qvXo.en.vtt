 diseases that cancer has to the 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.180
 mom 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.400

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.070

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.420

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.560
 communicate with them and know that I 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.900
 they are lying because it is very simple 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.780
 everything is fine but deep down I know 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.860

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
