00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.949 
read to keep up and I think that time is
better<00:06:00.469> spent<00:06:01.179> studying<00:06:02.179> chess<00:06:02.569> because<00:06:02.809> I

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
better spent studying chess because I

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.439 
better spent studying chess because I

different but at the same at the end of

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.529 
different but at the same at the end of
the<00:06:10.429> day<00:06:10.519> the<00:06:10.639> pieces<00:06:10.939> will<00:06:11.059> move<00:06:11.209> the<00:06:11.330> same
