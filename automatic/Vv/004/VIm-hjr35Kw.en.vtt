00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.590 
next task the system is going to check
what<00:04:15.860> we<00:04:15.980> call<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.280> rudder<00:04:16.519> drive<00:04:16.910> phase<00:04:17.239> and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
what we call the rudder drive phase and

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.970 
what we call the rudder drive phase and
that's<00:04:17.720> basically<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.320> make<00:04:18.470> sure<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.859> the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
that's basically to make sure that the

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.370 
that's basically to make sure that the
autopilot<00:04:19.430> dries<00:04:20.180> correctly<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.930> port<00:04:21.200> and

outboards to port or starboard you'll

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.770 
outboards to port or starboard you'll
see<00:04:34.340> some<00:04:34.550> motion<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.090> your<00:04:35.120> rudders<00:04:35.510> or<00:04:35.660> your

see some motion of your rudders or your

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
outboards and you'll just confirm yes or

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.460 
outboards and you'll just confirm yes or
no<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.300> case<00:04:38.540> did<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> rudder<00:04:39.050> move<00:04:39.290> to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
no in this case did the rudder move to

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.880 
no in this case did the rudder move to
port<00:04:39.740> yes<00:04:41.260> now<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.320> system<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.830> to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
port yes now the system is going to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.590 
port yes now the system is going to
drive<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> opposite<00:04:44.000> direction<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.510> we

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
drive in the opposite direction and we

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.970 
drive in the opposite direction and we
want<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.840> confirm<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.620> doing<00:04:45.860> that

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
want to confirm that it's doing that

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.360 
want to confirm that it's doing that
correctly<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:50.440> this<00:04:51.440> case<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.890> evolution

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
correctly in this case the evolution

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.250 
correctly in this case the evolution
system<00:04:52.730> did<00:04:52.940> drive<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.360> motors<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.810> starboard

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
system did drive the motors to starboard

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.040 
system did drive the motors to starboard
so<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.620> would<00:04:54.800> say<00:04:54.950> yes<00:04:55.190> in<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.300> event<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.810> went

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
so I would say yes in the event it went

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.900 
so I would say yes in the event it went
in<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.290> opposite<00:04:57.740> direction<00:04:57.890> than<00:04:58.370> expected

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
in the opposite direction than expected

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.909 
in the opposite direction than expected
you'd<00:04:59.270> say<00:04:59.479> no<00:04:59.510> and<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.260> autopilot<00:05:00.590> will

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
you'd say no and the autopilot will

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.860 
you'd say no and the autopilot will
compensate<00:05:01.400> automatically<00:05:02.090> by<00:05:02.270> reversing

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
compensate automatically by reversing

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.600 
compensate automatically by reversing
the<00:05:02.900> phase<00:05:03.229> of<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.590> drive<00:05:03.830> unit<00:05:06.370> now<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.580> our
