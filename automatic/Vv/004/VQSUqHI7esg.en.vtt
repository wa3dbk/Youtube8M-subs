00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.349 
strategy I'm definitely going for the
mines<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.920> where<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.219> majority<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
storages so I'm basically the way to get

storages so I'm basically the way to get
the<00:01:27.030> most<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.810> fight<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> take

in fact those mortars will one shot to
my<00:02:08.810> arches<00:02:09.370> so<00:02:10.370> I'm<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.940> took<00:02:11.240> them<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.600> with

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
my arches so I'm I took them up with

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.840 
my arches so I'm I took them up with
with<00:02:12.440> spells<00:02:12.800> which<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> good<00:02:13.400> use<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
with spells which is a good use of the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060 
with spells which is a good use of the
money<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.660> don't<00:02:14.840> normally<00:02:15.260> use<00:02:15.560> spells

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
money and I don't normally use spells

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.330 
money and I don't normally use spells
but<00:02:16.370> when<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:18.170> my<00:02:18.320> interest<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.860> then

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
but when it's in my interest to then

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.030 
but when it's in my interest to then
then<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> willed<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.350> I've<00:02:21.350> now<00:02:21.500> taken<00:02:21.560> out

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
then I willed it so I've now taken out

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.500 
then I willed it so I've now taken out
all<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.520> minds<00:02:22.730> except<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.450> one

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
all of the minds except for that one

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.830 
all of the minds except for that one
there<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.890> towards<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> top<00:02:25.430> right<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.510> as

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
there just towards the top right so as

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.810 
there just towards the top right so as
you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.080> see<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.500> send<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> barbarians<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
you can see I send in the barbarians to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.270 
you can see I send in the barbarians to
attract<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.360> fire<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.870> then<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.710> release<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
attract the fire and then I release the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880 
attract the fire and then I release the
archers<00:02:31.820> behind<00:02:32.360> them<00:02:32.840> as<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> support<00:02:33.620> and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
archers behind them as a support and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.500 
archers behind them as a support and
they<00:02:34.520> will<00:02:34.730> focus<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.490> cannon<00:02:38.390> own

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
they will focus on the the cannon own

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.640 
they will focus on the the cannon own
also<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.440> mind<00:02:39.820> while<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.650> barbarians

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
also the the mind while the barbarians

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.930 
also the the mind while the barbarians
are<00:02:42.710> getting<00:02:42.950> shots<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
are getting shots so now all of the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.530 
are getting shots so now all of the
mines<00:02:44.150> have<00:02:44.330> gone<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.800> probably<00:02:46.070> got

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
mines have gone so I probably got

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.450 
mines have gone so I probably got
300,000<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.810> bank<00:02:48.050> but<00:02:48.620> i'm<00:02:48.770> still<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:49.430> oh

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
300,000 in the bank but i'm still at oh

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.690 
300,000 in the bank but i'm still at oh
there's<00:02:49.850> one<00:02:49.880> more<00:02:50.000> mind<00:02:50.330> sorry<00:02:50.660> here<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.230> yeah

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
there's one more mind sorry here is yeah

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.300 
there's one more mind sorry here is yeah
i'll<00:02:52.700> take<00:02:53.120> out<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.540> one<00:02:53.810> by<00:02:54.410> distracting

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
i'll take out that one by distracting

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.000 
i'll take out that one by distracting
the<00:02:55.460> fire<00:02:55.730> with<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.720> barbarian<00:02:57.500> king<00:02:57.710> of<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
the fire with the barbarian king of the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.740 
the fire with the barbarian king of the
the<00:02:58.040> wizards<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.850> i'll<00:02:59.000> hopefully<00:02:59.270> get<00:02:59.600> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
the wizards and i'll hopefully get the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.420 
the wizards and i'll hopefully get the
arches<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.260> although<00:03:00.410> i<00:03:00.530> think<00:03:00.620> they<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.220> run

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
arches in although i think they just run

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.370 
arches in although i think they just run
a<00:03:01.490> little<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.910> too<00:03:02.060> quickly<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.260> they're

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
a little bit too quickly so they're

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.670 
a little bit too quickly so they're
probably<00:03:03.560> going<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.830> get<00:03:03.920> splashed<00:03:04.310> damaged

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
probably going to get splashed damaged

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.050 
probably going to get splashed damaged
so<00:03:06.680> i<00:03:06.710> lost<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.070> few<00:03:07.370> more<00:03:07.550> notches<00:03:07.670> then<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
so i lost a few more notches then it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.820 
so i lost a few more notches then it
showed<00:03:08.240> on<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.480> release<00:03:09.290> them<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.500> bit<00:03:09.650> too

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
showed on the release them a bit too

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.190 
showed on the release them a bit too
soon<00:03:10.070> but<00:03:10.310> not<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.610> worry<00:03:10.750> all<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.989> mines

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
soon but not to worry all of the mines

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.680 
soon but not to worry all of the mines
have<00:03:12.350> gone<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.060> I'll<00:03:14.060> take<00:03:14.270> all<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.450> town

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
have gone and I'll take all the town

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.630 
have gone and I'll take all the town
hall<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.380> gives<00:03:15.470> me<00:03:15.620> access<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.160> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
hall just so it gives me access to the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.120 
hall just so it gives me access to the
wall<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.330> then<00:03:17.930> my<00:03:18.080> barbarians<00:03:18.680> will<00:03:18.800> crunch

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
wall and then my barbarians will crunch

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.520 
wall and then my barbarians will crunch
through<00:03:19.459> my<00:03:20.209> barbarian<00:03:20.690> king<00:03:21.050> will<00:03:21.230> crunch

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
through my barbarian king will crunch

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.380 
through my barbarian king will crunch
through<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.150> meantime<00:03:23.330> my<00:03:23.959> arches

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
through and in the meantime my arches

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.120 
through and in the meantime my arches
especially<00:03:26.390> from<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.690> clan<00:03:26.989> castle<00:03:27.130> will

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
especially from the clan castle will

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.560 
especially from the clan castle will
take<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.610> wizard<00:03:28.760> which<00:03:29.090> they've<00:03:29.300> done

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
take all the wizard which they've done

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.550 
take all the wizard which they've done
take<00:03:30.380> out<00:03:30.530> storage<00:03:31.160> which<00:03:31.400> they've<00:03:31.640> done<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
take out storage which they've done and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.699 
take out storage which they've done and
now<00:03:33.560> i'm<00:03:33.620> into<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.100> base<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:35.380> it's<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.620> a

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
now i'm into the base so it's just a

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.770 
now i'm into the base so it's just a
case<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:36.920> using<00:03:37.400> brute<00:03:37.730> force<00:03:37.790> now<00:03:38.270> I've<00:03:38.480> taken

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
case of using brute force now I've taken

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.960 
case of using brute force now I've taken
out<00:03:38.930> most<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.620> splash<00:03:39.980> damage<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.670> I'm<00:03:40.790> not

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
out most of the splash damage so I'm not

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.960 
out most of the splash damage so I'm not
too<00:03:41.030> worried<00:03:41.390> about<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:43.790> just

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
too worried about that and it's just

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.070 
too worried about that and it's just
unfortunate<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.989> gold<00:03:45.260> storage<00:03:45.770> in<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
unfortunate that the gold storage in the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.130 
unfortunate that the gold storage in the
left<00:03:48.080> upper<00:03:48.380> most<00:03:48.800> section<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.840> far<00:03:50.840> away<00:03:50.989> from

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
left upper most section is far away from

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.630 
left upper most section is far away from
the<00:03:51.530> troops<00:03:51.800> because<00:03:52.040> they'll<00:03:52.340> probably

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
the troops because they'll probably

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.540 
the troops because they'll probably
target<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.800> elixir<00:03:54.800> first<00:03:55.040> which<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.310> yet

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
target the elixir first which is yet

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.699 
target the elixir first which is yet
they've<00:03:55.790> got<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.150> elixir<00:03:56.570> had<00:03:57.050> they<00:03:57.230> not<00:03:57.470> done

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
they've got the elixir had they not done

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.160 
they've got the elixir had they not done
that<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.010> would<00:03:58.040> have<00:03:58.220> got<00:03:58.400> all<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.640> gold<00:03:59.140> so<00:04:00.140> I

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
that I would have got all the gold so I

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.800 
that I would have got all the gold so I
was<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> little<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:01.040> unlucky<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.520> suppose<00:04:01.910> maybe

was a little bit unlucky I suppose maybe

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.100 
was a little bit unlucky I suppose maybe
a<00:04:02.930> few<00:04:03.170> more<00:04:03.230> goblins<00:04:04.190> would<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.700> helped

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
a few more goblins would have helped

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.050 
a few more goblins would have helped
level<00:04:06.110> 6<00:04:06.380> goblins<00:04:06.800> if<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.190> listen<00:04:07.519> supercell

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
level 6 goblins if you listen supercell

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.190 
level 6 goblins if you listen supercell
that<00:04:08.360> would<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.660> helped

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that would have helped

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
and so yeah and this is how that looked

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
and so yeah and this is how that looked
after<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.390> fight<00:04:14.569> was<00:04:14.750> done<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:16.239> 470,000<00:04:17.239> gold
