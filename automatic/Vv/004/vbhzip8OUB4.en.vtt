all right the movement learning today is
a<00:00:02.010> slightly<00:00:02.580> more<00:00:02.850> difficult<00:00:02.939> move<00:00:03.300> than

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
a slightly more difficult move than

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.370 
a slightly more difficult move than
we've<00:00:03.629> been<00:00:03.659> learn<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.020> last<00:00:04.200> couple

weeks but it's a fun one and it's a
staple<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.410> lot<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.799> routines<00:00:08.130> and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
staple of a lot of routines and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.410 
staple of a lot of routines and
definitely<00:00:08.670> crowd-pleaser

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
definitely crowd-pleaser

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.940

it's called the shadow pass and it looks
something<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:12.950> all<00:00:13.950> right<00:00:14.099> it's

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
something just like this all right it's

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.090 
something just like this all right it's
a<00:00:14.400> blind<00:00:14.870> it's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> blind<00:00:16.109> catch<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.010> one

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a blind it's a blind catch which is one

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.730 
a blind it's a blind catch which is one
of<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> most<00:00:17.340> difficult<00:00:17.490> parts<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> me<00:00:18.740> but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
of the most difficult parts of me but

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.200 
of the most difficult parts of me but
really<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.100> best<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> start<00:00:20.789> practicing

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
really the best way to start practicing

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
really the best way to start practicing
it<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> literally<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.650> take<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> bow<00:00:23.070> you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it is literally to just take a bow you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340 
it is literally to just take a bow you
can<00:00:23.760> also<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> tin<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:24.930> for

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
can also do this with a tin but it's for

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.570 
can also do this with a tin but it's for
practice<00:00:25.680> sake<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.130> easier<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
practice sake it's a lot easier with the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.870 
practice sake it's a lot easier with the
bottle<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.750> literally<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.500> hand<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.010> behind

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bottle and literally just hand it behind

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
bottle and literally just hand it behind
your<00:00:30.090> head<00:00:30.769> just<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.290> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
your head just like so and then as you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.389 
your head just like so and then as you
practice<00:00:35.180> start<00:00:36.180> getting<00:00:36.690> used<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.399> just

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
practice start getting used to just

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.510 
practice start getting used to just
doing<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.420> throw<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> tiny<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.399> an

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
doing a little throw just a tiny like an

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
doing a little throw just a tiny like an
inch<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> time<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> get

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
inch at a time and as you get

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
inch at a time and as you get
comfortable<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.719> extend<00:00:46.460> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
comfortable with that you can extend the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
comfortable with that you can extend the
reach<00:00:47.719> until<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.800> way

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
but it doesn't hurt to do this when

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
but it doesn't hurt to do this when
someone<00:01:06.659> else's<00:01:06.900> around<00:01:06.990> I've<00:01:07.530> seen<00:01:07.740> people

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the other thing is just a pointer on how

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
the other thing is just a pointer on how
to<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.290> achieve<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> move<00:01:16.770> I've<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to actually achieve a move I've had a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310 
to actually achieve a move I've had a
couple<00:01:17.880> students<00:01:18.330> say<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.080> throw

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
couple students say that when they throw

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
couple students say that when they throw
it<00:01:19.439> they<00:01:19.590> watch<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.040> catching<00:01:20.460> hand<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.150> found

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it they watch the catching hand I found

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
it they watch the catching hand I found
that<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.020> difficult<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.369> only

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that really difficult because you only

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
that really difficult because you only
have<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> split<00:01:24.299> second<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.830> adjust<00:01:25.830> where<00:01:26.280> your

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
have a split second to adjust where your

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.039 
have a split second to adjust where your
hands<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.030> once<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> bottle

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
hands gonna be once you see the bottle

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
hands gonna be once you see the bottle
coming<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.590> periphery<00:01:29.150> what<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
coming out of your periphery what I like

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.749 
coming out of your periphery what I like
to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> juggler<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.590> say<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.549> said

before if you get good catches if you
get<00:01:34.590> good<00:01:34.710> good<00:01:35.040> throws<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.850> catches<00:01:36.210> will

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
