 Kanoute 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.820
 bruno blanckaert a priori there is not much in common between all 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.880
 these actions performed today in different craft if not the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.369
 dissociation basin of the site that we study in this clip 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.669
 death the principle of dissociation pelvis bust is very simple it's all about 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.360
 to make completely independent of the bags on the back of the body of the minister 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.310
 of those of the lower body and therefore kayak these two national parties 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 completely independent of each other 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.770
 10:40 p.m. 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.760
 in the river it is very important to keep a good flexibility of the basin 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.790
 to dampen all the imbalances related to the rocks met with the current 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.480
 heavy wba cross it 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 it is clear here that my kayak and manhandled but yet member of the circle 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.160
 right allows me to pull myself out of this situation 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.740
 on the contrary it's the paddler is very true that all the shock and the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.820
 disturbances suffered by his kayak integrally transmitted to his bust he 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 is in a position of imbalance 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.030
 in this the men the dissociation basin bust applies mainly 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.000
 to facilitate rotations and we'll take that these examples of anchoring 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.520
 we often see the pay 10 years realize this figure only by 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.970
 serving their arms 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.120
 also using the bust it is possible to have a much more attitude 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.570
 important than the final result and much better 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.900
 I start my figure by rotating my head the shoulders and the set of 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.450
 my bus as to manage to place the stick parallel to my kayak 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.560
 I can then start Morocco signed for a year my legs in the focus all 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.570
 the world is all in 12 years correctly contradicting it 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.730
 seven rotations of the bust allows me to gain amplitude this then able 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.300
 to place my opinion as far as possible towards the rear tip 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.870
 I also gain in power because I use all the muscles of my 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.870
 purpose it was rather that we simply died 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.279
 of a pamphlet stany the discipline based on the rotations of the kayak the 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.280
 industrial basin separation textron load-bearing application also 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.959
 schematically in the vast majority of figures one must first 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.029
 rotate my bus block his position using the paddle to 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.029
 then bring my kayak back in the desired direction 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.620
 this is valid for basic figures such as the 360 ​​degrees for the kart wii 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 but also for the most advanced figures like their blog 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.409
 beyond the technique specific to each figure must therefore remember what 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.109
 Fundamental principle 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.029
 my bust my shoulders and my gaze yes always a time of advanced on my 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.129
 kayak 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.809
 here I hope that these few illustrations they allowed better 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.999
 identify and understand the many applications of the 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.549
 dissociation pelvis bust in kayak 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.829
 it's up to you now to work on this specific point of your technique and to 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.849
 make the most
