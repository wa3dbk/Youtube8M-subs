look<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.780> found<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.739> crystal<00:02:26.280> seems<00:02:26.519> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
look what I found this crystal seems to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.440 
look what I found this crystal seems to
be<00:02:26.790> full<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.299> green<00:02:27.599> ego<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.680> warm<00:02:29.450> this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
be full of green ego and it's warm this

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
be full of green ego and it's warm this
is<00:02:30.690> amazing<00:02:31.230> ha<00:02:32.220> let<00:02:33.090> me<00:02:33.209> see<00:02:33.390> let<00:02:33.420> me<00:02:33.629> see<00:02:34.160> are

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
is amazing ha let me see let me see are

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.369 
is amazing ha let me see let me see are
we<00:02:35.280> rich<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:36.150> crystal<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.720> acting<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.260> an

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
we rich this crystal is acting like an

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.949 
we rich this crystal is acting like an
eco<00:02:37.620> prism<00:02:38.129> it's<00:02:38.670> slowly<00:02:39.030> taking<00:02:39.510> darkie

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
eco prism it's slowly taking darkie

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.259 
eco prism it's slowly taking darkie
going<00:02:40.260> converting<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.860> into<00:02:40.920> green<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:42.090> I

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
going converting it into green if I

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.440 
going converting it into green if I
could<00:02:42.450> speed<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.870> up<00:02:43.190> I've<00:02:44.190> got<00:02:44.519> an<00:02:44.640> idea

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
could speed that up I've got an idea

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.020 
could speed that up I've got an idea
okay<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.709> crystal<00:02:48.129> is<00:02:48.220> hooked<00:02:48.459> into<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.790> fuel

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
okay the crystal is hooked into the fuel

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
okay the crystal is hooked into the fuel
relays<00:02:49.420> I've<00:02:49.720> added<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.440> power<00:02:50.650> condenser<00:02:51.250> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
relays I've added a power condenser to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.920 
relays I've added a power condenser to
focus<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> output<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> couple<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.720> loop

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
focus the output and a couple of loop

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.110 
focus the output and a couple of loop

you<00:03:12.130> know<00:03:12.340> what<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.670> means<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.870> means<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.440> may

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
you know what this means it means we may

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.619 
you know what this means it means we may
be<00:03:14.680> able<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.040> create<00:03:15.370> other<00:03:15.730> colors<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.299> eco
