00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
grid you don't have to spend points on
that<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> passing<00:01:40.829> up

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that and you're going to be passing up

that and you're going to be passing up
other<00:01:41.280> perks<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.119> perks<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.689> less

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
less squad points in general then you're

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030

my classes when I'm going for kem
strikes<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.619> class<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.129> probably

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
strikes and so this class is probably

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.160 
strikes and so this class is probably
what<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> would<00:02:11.910> choose<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.390> fact<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
what I would choose in fact it is what I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
what I would choose in fact it is what I
choose

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
choose

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
choose
is<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.490> choose<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> recently

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is what I choose when I recently

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
is what I choose when I recently
prestiged<00:02:15.990> because<00:02:16.710> off<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> grid<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.220> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
prestiged because off the grid is so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100 
prestiged because off the grid is so
expensive<00:02:17.820> because<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.420> felt<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.870> really

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
expensive because I felt like I really

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.590 
expensive because I felt like I really
wanted<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.770> we're<00:02:20.040> free<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.420> want

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
wanted it if we're free because I want

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.210 
wanted it if we're free because I want
to<00:02:21.660> try<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> honey<00:02:22.200> badger<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.740> because

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to try out the honey badger and because

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
to try out the honey badger and because
i<00:02:23.250> use<00:02:23.610> dead<00:02:23.850> silent<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.870> freaking<00:02:25.350> time

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
i use dead silent all the freaking time

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.710 
i use dead silent all the freaking time
now<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> class<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> heavy<00:02:27.420> gunner

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
now a class little like the heavy gunner

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.110 
now a class little like the heavy gunner
is<00:02:27.990> probably<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:28.650> very<00:02:29.460> unpopular<00:02:29.820> i

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
is probably very very unpopular i

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.180 
is probably very very unpopular i
encourage<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.510> guys<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.720> not<00:02:31.560> use<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.980> unless

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
encourage you guys to not use it unless

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830 
encourage you guys to not use it unless
you<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.730> feel<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.180> some<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.450> these<00:02:33.510> perks

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you really feel like some of these perks

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.470 
you really feel like some of these perks
are<00:02:34.080> really<00:02:34.590> essential<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:35.310> based<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.030> my

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
are really essential but based on my

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
are really essential but based on my
analysis<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> game<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.740> far<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.190> don't

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
analysis of the game so far I don't

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.430 
analysis of the game so far I don't
think<00:02:38.670> very<00:02:39.000> many<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:39.540> perks<00:02:39.810> are<00:02:40.020> maybe

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
think very many of these perks are maybe

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.740 
think very many of these perks are maybe
hardline<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.730> ping<00:02:42.060> ping<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> pretty

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
hardline maybe ping ping is a pretty

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
hardline maybe ping ping is a pretty
solid<00:02:42.990> Park<00:02:43.320> but<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.070> only<00:02:44.190> cost<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.610> six

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
solid Park but it only cost like six

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.610 
solid Park but it only cost like six
squad<00:02:45.180> points<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.600> maybe<00:02:45.810> even<00:02:45.900> lesson<00:02:46.530> on

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
squad points or maybe even lesson on

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.200 
squad points or maybe even lesson on
somewhere<00:02:46.950> around<00:02:47.070> there<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.880> not<00:02:47.940> as

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
somewhere around there but it's not as

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.910 
somewhere around there but it's not as
expensive<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.840> others<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.530> don't<00:02:49.590> think

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
expensive as others so I don't think

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.650 
expensive as others so I don't think
that<00:02:50.070> loadout<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:51.030> probably<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that loadout is probably going to be the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.840 
that loadout is probably going to be the
best<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.140> most<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.530> guys<00:02:52.560> however<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
best for most of you guys however the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.730 
best for most of you guys however the
marksman<00:02:54.360> loadout<00:02:54.630> right<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
marksman loadout right here this is

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.260 
marksman loadout right here this is
interesting<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.700> does<00:02:56.910> give<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
interesting because it does give you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.840 
interesting because it does give you

amplify and focus for free which in my
mind<00:02:59.880> are<00:03:00.300> very<00:03:00.960> very<00:03:01.410> necessary<00:03:02.040> focus<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the most important perk in the game in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
the most important perk in the game in
my<00:03:04.500> opinion<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.580> guys<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.760> from

my opinion as you guys know from
previous<00:03:06.300> videos<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.050> then<00:03:07.830> amplify<00:03:08.310> as<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
previous videos and then amplify as a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.270 
previous videos and then amplify as a
perk<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.970> love<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.630> use<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.560> very<00:03:10.860> very

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
perk that I love to use it's very very

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.860 
perk that I love to use it's very very
good<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.820> any<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.210> all<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.600> gaming

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
good for any of you all to have gaming

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.650 
good for any of you all to have gaming
headsets<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.620> use<00:03:13.830> them<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.340> advantage

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
headsets and use them to your advantage

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.970 
headsets and use them to your advantage
so<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.780> might<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.170> class<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.830> guys

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so this might be a class that you guys

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.680 
so this might be a class that you guys
would<00:03:17.190> go<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.460> if<00:03:17.640> you're<00:03:17.940> not<00:03:18.090> really<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.420> fan

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
would go with if you're not really a fan

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.390 
would go with if you're not really a fan
of<00:03:18.750> off<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.230> grid<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.710> don't<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.250> use

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
of off the grid if you don't really use

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.580 
of off the grid if you don't really use
it<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> lot<00:03:20.810> then<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.990> could<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.320> with<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it a lot then you could go with the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710 
it a lot then you could go with the
marksmen<00:03:22.980> setup<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.700> thing<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:23.940> don't

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
marksmen setup and the thing is don't

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330 
marksmen setup and the thing is don't
let<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.110> mind<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.470> tainted<00:03:25.860> by<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.040> fact

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
let your mind be tainted by the fact

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.530 
let your mind be tainted by the fact
that<00:03:26.430> its<00:03:26.640> marksman<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.210> that<00:03:27.330> you're

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
that its marksman and that you're

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.780 
that its marksman and that you're
getting<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.930> sniper<00:03:28.230> for<00:03:28.560> free<00:03:28.860> because<00:03:29.550> if

getting a sniper for free because if

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130 
getting a sniper for free because if
none<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> other<00:03:30.210> guns<00:03:30.450> really<00:03:30.630> matter<00:03:30.930> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.230
