00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.489
 because I have an order for you 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.739
 with this introduction, the dancer and choreographer Claudia Milan 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:18.679
 houses stores and public spaces of araraquara this Tuesday during 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.579
 the whole day to present up to speak whether contemporary home dance 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.989
 presentations integrate the agenda of the group at the dance festival of araraquara 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.599
 open on Monday night and were commissioned to give away friends 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.100
 family members and partners in a collective individualistic way 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.560
 without knowing of the surprise those contemplated with this performace so special 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.400
 unusual in all kinds of reactions, most are suspicious at first but 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.950
 after entering the atmosphere said excited and the reactions are the surpasses 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 has such mistrustful reactions 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 If someone knocks on the door, someone tells them that the person thinks 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 There is a very good thing this culture of the catch is that with the psdb 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.810
 was forgotten 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.070
 inhabitants of land and sea 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.009
 because of that 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.390
 there are people who agree to negotiate anything 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.370
 I have lived such moments with people that I have not 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.560
 I have been invited for lunch for months. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.300
 There are people who want me to come back another day. 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.790
 there are people who write better then so to the public that what you take 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.000
 the work itself, the strategy of taking it easy. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.220
 I could never find who we love 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 jefferson is centered on the head covered by a stranger 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 because to me it's really a time 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.440
 among those contemplated in araraquara was the businesswoman godelite country 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.799
 in love with contemporary dance 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.759
 who received the daughter's gift auction in me the fine of six days after the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.340
 contemporary dance class 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.060
 the interest of the proposal 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.620
 I found it cool, different. 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.740
 he will represent us and modify 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.770
 raikkonen was a very nice surprise 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 My daughter knows she said the most 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.400
 the cost of the party giving 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.590
 contemporary music and dance is in the passion of expressing ourselves 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.879
 through movement 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.409
 I do not know what to say of the silver in the ugly btl half of the law that every day 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.439
 they do this for a mother 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.840
 and wants to see the grená team 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.330
 the carioca dancer 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.300
 account that it is all done according to the spaces and objects available in the place 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.249
 from ataulfo ​​alves tables 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.789
 on one occasion Claudia came to do the performance in a car I was once 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.549
 many different songs 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.650
 I have already eaten your desire to transfer to make the demand 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.569
 by the former First Lady 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.400
 I already did the brand rio niterói and maricá 3 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.039
 I made the customer in the car 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.819
 wait seven very different presentations this way of discussing 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.839
 places the dance as it is perceived its resources reach 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:02.539
 was developed by the dancer cláudia miller in 2004 and has already been presented in 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.209
 international national festivals 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.909
 This is a 2004 project. 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.569
 I made a first attempt is a union test 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.079
 there are people who seek to occupy public spaces and here it is really 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.849
 going to work 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.369
 this dance issue 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.659
 enter another space that is not a stage space of the theater 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.859
 one day it's over 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.339
 pharmacy deliverer etc. 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.519
 donati athlete 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.129
 who does not deliver in 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.839
 but delivery as 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.649
 Bracken that way and disappear 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:43.639
 in 2006 was 2007 I did a videodance project 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.929
 tries to rebuild the work only from the point of view of the pib 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.599
 take the testimonials of people who received 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.189
 and tries to rebuild this dance that would not be seen in the raffle being a videodance 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.309
 and from the leadership experience is that work began to gain a 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.249
 another dimension 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.249
 a gvt 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:09.659
