their<00:05:07.120> games<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:08.740> think<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.400> makes<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.700> a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
their games and I think it makes it a

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.670 
their games and I think it makes it a
great<00:05:09.910> addition<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:11.020> you've<00:05:11.140> got<00:05:11.170> a<00:05:11.260> victory

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
great addition so you've got a victory

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.740 
great addition so you've got a victory
lost<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:12.190> bitch<00:05:12.430> we<00:05:12.580> denied<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.210> then<00:05:13.510> I

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
lost a bitch we denied and then I

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.600 
lost a bitch we denied and then I
imagine<00:05:14.260> there'll<00:05:14.950> be<00:05:14.980> more<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.430> future

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
imagine there'll be more in the future

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.150 
imagine there'll be more in the future
maybe<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.450> victory<00:05:17.170> granted<00:05:17.650> whenever<00:05:17.950> the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
maybe a victory granted whenever the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.920 
maybe a victory granted whenever the
Soviets<00:05:18.610> finally<00:05:18.880> take<00:05:19.090> Berlin<00:05:19.420> I<00:05:19.600> don't<00:05:19.810> know

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
Soviets finally take Berlin I don't know

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.200 
Soviets finally take Berlin I don't know
