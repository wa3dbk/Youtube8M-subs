there but yeah this could maybe pop up

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.299 
there but yeah this could maybe pop up
something<00:00:56.570> like<00:00:56.600> my<00:00:56.989> career<00:00:57.559> next<00:00:57.890> season

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
something like my career next season

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.599 
something like my career next season
maybe<00:00:58.879> play<00:00:59.210> as<00:00:59.390> different<00:00:59.840> players<00:01:00.609> while

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
maybe play as different players while

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.490 
maybe play as different players while
you<00:01:01.699> play<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.000> game<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:02.660> as<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.899> do<00:01:03.079> all<00:01:03.350> you

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
you play the game so as you do all you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.470 
you play the game so as you do all you
have<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.679> do<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:03.920> just<00:01:03.949> run<00:01:04.309> your<00:01:04.910> route<00:01:05.210> with

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
have to do is just run your route with

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.600 
have to do is just run your route with
your<00:01:05.630> receiver<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.410> call<00:01:07.130> for<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.400> ball

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
your receiver and call for the ball

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.430 
your receiver and call for the ball
which<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.330> cool<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.630> added<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:08.960> call<00:01:09.140> for<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
which is cool to added that call for the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.620 
which is cool to added that call for the
ball<00:01:09.620> button<00:01:09.950> instead<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.090> QB<00:01:11.420> just

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
ball button instead of the QB just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.569 
ball button instead of the QB just
randomly<00:01:11.960> throwing<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.440> at<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:13.460> got

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
randomly throwing it at you so you got

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.010 
randomly throwing it at you so you got
that<00:01:13.700> call<00:01:13.970> for<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.210> ball<00:01:14.420> there<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.900> then

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
that call for the ball there and then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.690 
that call for the ball there and then
once<00:01:15.290> you're<00:01:15.470> there<00:01:15.680> plant<00:01:16.100> your<00:01:16.189> feet<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
once you're there plant your feet and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.429 
once you're there plant your feet and
you<00:01:17.090> try<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.299> get<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.689> zone<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:18.320> is

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
you try to get in the zone so this is

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.190 
you try to get in the zone so this is
actually<00:01:18.590> really<00:01:18.860> fun<00:01:19.189> um<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:20.360> extremely

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
actually really fun um it's extremely

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.859 
actually really fun um it's extremely
fun<00:01:21.409> actually<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.460> weird<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.420> little

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
fun actually is a little weird a little

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.389 
fun actually is a little weird a little
bit<00:01:24.020> just<00:01:24.229> because<00:01:24.530> you're<00:01:24.890> not<00:01:24.979> used<00:01:25.040> to

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
bit just because you're not used to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.280 
bit just because you're not used to
running<00:01:26.090> around<00:01:26.299> with<00:01:26.600> your<00:01:26.720> receiver<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
running around with your receiver and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.080 
running around with your receiver and
calling<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.829> ball<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.100> everything<00:01:28.579> so

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
calling for the ball and everything so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.240 
calling for the ball and everything so
it<00:01:29.450> gets<00:01:29.540> some<00:01:29.750> used<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.079> getting<00:01:30.350> up<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:31.159> get

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
it gets some used to getting up to get

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.340 
it gets some used to getting up to get
the<00:01:31.399> timing<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> everything<00:01:32.229> actually<00:01:33.229> that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
the timing and everything actually that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.859 
the timing and everything actually that
run<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:33.590> there<00:01:33.950> was<00:01:34.100> perfect<00:01:34.689> but<00:01:35.689> other

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
run right there was perfect but other

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.920 
run right there was perfect but other
times<00:01:36.170> I<00:01:36.350> wasn't<00:01:36.710> as<00:01:36.799> successful<00:01:37.630> but<00:01:38.630> like

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
times I wasn't as successful but like

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.380 
times I wasn't as successful but like
right<00:01:39.110> here<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.159> guys<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.430> see<00:01:40.700> kind<00:01:41.180> of

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
right here as you guys to see kind of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.600 
right here as you guys to see kind of
just<00:01:41.659> because<00:01:41.930> I<00:01:42.049> faced<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:43.219> other<00:01:43.340> direction

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
just because I faced the other direction

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.429 
just because I faced the other direction
i<00:01:43.939> think<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.299> quarterback<00:01:44.719> wanted<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.229> throw

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
i think the quarterback wanted to throw

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.350 
i think the quarterback wanted to throw
that<00:01:45.469> way<00:01:45.799> but<00:01:46.369> i<00:01:46.430> really<00:01:46.759> wanted<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.149> get<00:01:47.240> in

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
that way but i really wanted to get in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.929 
that way but i really wanted to get in
the<00:01:47.479> zone<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:47.899> there<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> little<00:01:48.680> like

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
the zone so there is a little like

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.310 
the zone so there is a little like
things<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.060> need<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.270> work<00:01:50.329> on<00:01:50.659> if<00:01:50.840> they<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.049> add

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
things I need to work on if they do add

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.620 
things I need to work on if they do add
this<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:52.399> is<00:01:52.549> understandable<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.479> it's

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
this which is understandable but it's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.179 
this which is understandable but it's
really<00:01:53.810> fun<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.229> really<00:01:54.469> cool<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.039> they

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
really fun and really cool that they

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.940 
really fun and really cool that they
added<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:56.020> because<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> could<00:01:57.289> maybe<00:01:57.439> pop<00:01:57.770> up

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
added this because it could maybe pop up

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.580 
added this because it could maybe pop up
something<00:01:58.340> like<00:01:58.369> my<00:01:58.640> career<00:01:59.180> for<00:02:00.110> next<00:02:00.380> season

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
something like my career for next season

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.350 
something like my career for next season
so<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.799> get<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.070> go<00:02:01.219> ahead<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.909> daily<00:02:02.210> one

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually came up I believe three times

or<00:02:04.399> two<00:02:04.549> times<00:02:04.759> already<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:06.320> go<00:02:06.530> ahead<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.829> run

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
or two times already we go ahead and run
