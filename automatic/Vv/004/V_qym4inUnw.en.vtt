00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 agent dash video review 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.389
 the title is a running game indeed 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.110

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.110
 let's see the menu options together 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.900
 then the screens are two both in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.970
 before in the second in the upper right 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.400
 we will find in the number of gems 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.349
 collected central part of the first 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 facebook login screen below a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.149
 left and gadget and I unlocked the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 magnets that serves to attract to you the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 gems go button at the bottom right for 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 start the second screen match 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.899
 The statistics of setting goals 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 music and sensibility effects of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 commands I put them up high for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 replay the tutorial and login 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.399

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.469
 so we see together in the commands like 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.500
 we said at the beginning of the video review 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.570
 dash agent is a running game then 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 purpose of the game is to run more 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 as far as possible 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 and obviously try to avoid everyone 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.170
 the obstacles we encounter during the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170
 our journey 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:25.770
 then to move us will serve his 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:29.150
 for side swipe left swipe 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.150
 upwards to jump 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.550
 turning down to lower if 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.780
 you want to generate this by right 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.820
 curve or more we could also shoot 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.300
 obviously in certain situations 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.330
 of the match 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.800
 now the tutorial for completed 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.160
 now let's start the real one 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:58.140
 level as I told you the gems these 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.119
 they must be collected during the game because 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 we will not only need to unlock 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.220
 for example gadgets but also to have 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 new characters 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.330
 the first setting of this first one 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.980
 this level is really very nice 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.989
 canvas forest here is what I told you 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150
 that had unlocked the magnet like 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.250
 you will see now without me moving 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 a part another gems come from 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.780
 having lost my direction 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.870
 however if I remember correctly it is limited in the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.370
 meaning for a certain amount of time indeed 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.519
 the magnet effect will play 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.519
 new setting 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.650
 here is the magnet again 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.080
 high jump in a jump 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.680
 how do you see the title really turn 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.670
