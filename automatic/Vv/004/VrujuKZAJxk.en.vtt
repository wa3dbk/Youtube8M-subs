00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.740 
center lift straighten the leg push it
out<00:02:38.739> bend<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.069> knee<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.549> then<00:02:41.209> bring<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.480> back

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
out bend the knee and then bring it back

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:52.810 
out bend the knee and then bring it back
the<00:02:41.930> center<00:02:42.730> up<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:44.900> down<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:50.500> down<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:52.459> again

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the center up out down in down and again

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.050 
the center up out down in down and again
we're<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.030> focusing<00:02:53.630> on<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:53.989> left<00:02:54.319> side

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
we're just focusing on this left side

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.509 
we're just focusing on this left side
feeling<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.209> circle<00:02:56.780> right<00:02:57.470> there<00:02:57.769> because

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
feeling that circle right there because

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.090 
feeling that circle right there because
you<00:02:58.730> want<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> think<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.569> drawing<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.980> if

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
you want to think of it drawing like if

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.250 
you want to think of it drawing like if
you<00:03:01.160> had<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> pencil<00:03:01.579> stuck<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.209> your<00:03:02.329> hip<00:03:02.480> it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
you had a pencil stuck to your hip it's

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.550 
you had a pencil stuck to your hip it's
drying<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:04.010> out<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:05.350> start

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
drying it out like this start

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.630 
drying it out like this start
to<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.920> outside<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.860> now<00:03:09.860> we're<00:03:10.489> going<00:03:10.580> to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to the outside of you now we're going to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.240 
to the outside of you now we're going to
try<00:03:10.849> to<00:03:10.910> put<00:03:11.390> those<00:03:11.510> two<00:03:11.810> circles<00:03:12.170> together<00:03:12.319> so

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
try to put those two circles together so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.420 
try to put those two circles together so
our<00:03:13.400> eight<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:14.330> one<00:03:14.989> loop<00:03:15.170> here<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.680> then<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
our eight is one loop here and then the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.160 
our eight is one loop here and then the
other<00:03:16.610> loop<00:03:16.910> here<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.989> comes<00:03:18.260> out<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:19.220> way

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
other loop here that comes out this way

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.320 
other loop here that comes out this way
so<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.530> imagine<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.250> stuck<00:03:22.700> in<00:03:22.849> between<00:03:23.150> two

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
so I imagine that I stuck in between two

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.479 
so I imagine that I stuck in between two
walls<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.080> cannot<00:03:24.319> twist<00:03:24.709> my<00:03:24.950> hips<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.370> all

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
walls and it cannot twist my hips at all

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.000 
walls and it cannot twist my hips at all
so<00:03:26.060> there's<00:03:26.209> no<00:03:26.330> twisting<00:03:26.750> movement<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.800> all

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so there's no twisting movement it's all

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.690 
so there's no twisting movement it's all
up<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.489> down<00:03:29.230> step<00:03:30.230> straighten<00:03:31.160> my<00:03:31.250> right<00:03:31.459> leg

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
up and down step straighten my right leg

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.309 
up and down step straighten my right leg
I<00:03:32.650> push<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:34.280> out<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.849> to<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.330> right<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.170> my

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
I push it out to this to the right so my

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.309 
I push it out to this to the right so my
weight<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.800> again<00:03:37.220> outside<00:03:37.519> my<00:03:37.970> foot<00:03:38.319> there

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
weight is a again outside my foot there

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.580 
weight is a again outside my foot there
bend<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.040> right<00:03:40.220> knee<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.989> as<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.200> bent<00:03:42.410> that

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
bend the right knee and as I bent that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.120 
bend the right knee and as I bent that
need<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.400> notice<00:03:43.670> my<00:03:43.850> left<00:03:44.030> came<00:03:44.690> up<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:46.010> now

need you notice my left came up so now
it's<00:03:46.549> already<00:03:46.730> up<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.299> I'm<00:03:47.420> going<00:03:47.600> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
it's already up there so I'm going to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.720 
it's already up there so I'm going to
push<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.110> out<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.590> side<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.299> then<00:03:50.299> go<00:03:50.989> down

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
in the abdominals let's try it one more

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:54.430 
in the abdominals let's try it one more
time

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440
