00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 chess match 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.780
 we have here a position which you have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 what do you solve? 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 It's worth it if you have to move to the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 as if they had to move to the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.250
 white win both sides you have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.300
 the issue of deviation 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.580
 ok it's simple you have to solve it 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.450
 for yourselves, the play is good 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.130
 black 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.730
 starting with the black one would be 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.640
 we see the king enclosed by his barrier of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.090
 pawns 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.750
 we see the column of the open lady worth 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.380
 and we see that if both a tower and a 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.660
 lady could come to the front row 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.020
 It would be worth a checkmate 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.800
 we quickly see a lady sacrifice 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 with a deviation theme 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.900
 lady c1 check big lady sacrifice and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.270
 when capturing the lady put bishop was us 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.799
 will open the column 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 will be open for the tower that 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.220
 I will give a checkmate sacrifice of 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.270
 Lady 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 and checkmate with the tower 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.400
 OK 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.100
 back bad position 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 in case it touches them moderates the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 white as a matter of deviation as 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.700
 then slaughter of lama dame by bishop 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.470
 lady for h 5 check 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
 and now 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.159
 if the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.549
 black capture because it has simply been 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.549
 open 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.300
 this row for our tower that will support 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 with the bishop tip a checkmate 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.810
 because the column is open 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.810
 the other tower 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.480
 the white ones returning them to the position 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.209
 Black could extend his agony further 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 not eating the range although they would already go 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.600
 losing but they could extend the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.870
 agony with king g8 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.530
 but that does not stop White from 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.870
 Checkmate also with tower because 6 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.870
 Check now if the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.900
 again 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.850
 Well, now every king has touched him 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:04.270
 now if Black captures 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:08.230
 efe by g6 lady because 6 check king f 8 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.580
 lady s 6 check 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.520
 Lady 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.950
 only queen f 7 and with bishop h 6 check 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.790
