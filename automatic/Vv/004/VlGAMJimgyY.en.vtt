00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 good I am is I have the guards for 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.930
 taught to make another achievement the achievement of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.719
 today is going to be this here from the theory 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.679
 of the camper that is one that is needed 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.299
 for necessary for the glory of the hero 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 is the producer of the red bow I'm going 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 to try to do all you can 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.130
 alone and then I called diapers to record 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.970
 what more people need 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.699
 good this from the theory of chaos what 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.039
 asks is that we defeat healthy manus in the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.649
 nexus on heroic difficulty from behind 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.769
 a heroic without destroying any failure 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.110
 chaotic to go to the nexus you have to go to 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.710
 raja norte to the labor tunda and the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.949
 entrance is right here and I am the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.199
 coordinates roughly 28 or 29 which is 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.930
 this one that has made the porta plus is here 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.820
 the stone and when we enter there are several 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.689
 is the one below the middle one and one more 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.699
 up and the bottom one all came here 

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:01.200
 remember to put in difficulty five 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.860
 heroic players and enter 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.440
 once inside 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 abnormal is is here while it is by 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.420
 here what I'm going to follow is the way 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.280
 this one on the right to go straight from 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.190
 there's more here because I do not want to touch more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.260
 voices because there are more achievements here today 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.550
 I will explain only this one, I do not know 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.710
 He explained all the achievements he puts here 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.720
 do here I will take a lot no 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 having albos and now I'm still there the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.160
 good video I'm already in front of no malus 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 the path that followed the belief 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.510
 before here I am here around here 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.810
 by me to the bottom raised here by 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.540
 here and here 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 here is the anomalous lord in heroic 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 if he kills it very quickly he managed to jump 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.120
 I'm going to make him make a mistake at least 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 so you can see what faults are 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.409
 if you fail 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.760
 what I do not know is going through your eyes 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.760
 quintana 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.270
 third fails plus the family 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.270
 this the factory while this is 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.550
 You are getting to get out many or 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.260
 It hurt, it hurts, it does not hurt 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.040
 is to touch it so nothing 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 at the time 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.990
 it is immune 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.250
 do not touch the faults 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.410
 chaotic caesar 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.840
 that they go immune 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.580
 and kill him if he kills him he could have 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.110
 destroyed without making any failure 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.110
 but well the beautiful ones 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.550
 and perhaps 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.880
 acute 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.640
 conforming to the desolate 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.690
 a quantum fault is like this all selection 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.690
 very easy 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.420
 so nothing you already have one more achievement if 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.430
 you have not done it is closer to the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.650
 red proto I will be doing along 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.209
 the weeks because now he just dedicated a 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.010
 couple of days to achievements and I'm going to 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.080
 try to farmar pets and that to do it 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.819
 more mixed good in the weeks that 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.859
 have events 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.450
 and if you want me to make some achievement in 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.400
 concrete something just put me in the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.480
 comment and we talked about how I'm going to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 do 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.530
 and I hope that the video serves or likes and 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.530
 thank you very much for having seen it
