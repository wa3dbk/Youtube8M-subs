00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.660
 to what extent does he dramatize consciously or 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 To what extent do you actually have to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 assess situation as risky yes 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.880
 So I think he wants me too 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 do not dramatize anything 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 that should not assume or 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.289
 Do not assume that he is the thing 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 consciously putin's putin dramatizes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 Consciously accepted 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.320
 I want to say that with the conscious 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.939
 destabilize the purpose of this order 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.860
 but at least I'll say that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.149
 Additional development of Europe 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.100
 Integration process also aligning 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.170
 direction central and eastern europe and also 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 of course, to undermine the nato and to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 prevent with all means that is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.750
 really something and so stylized 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 is also what that is something like a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 global power poker also here it works 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 not only Ukraine is here 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.590
 in fact, in fact, too 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.170
 again about a system competition and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.170
 a global geopolitical power struggle 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 So I have to tell them honestly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.950
 not more than at the moment 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.990
 fact that we see how high 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.549
 Of course, this visit also classified 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 becomes 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.909
 as far as the protocol is concerned 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.680
 protocol I mean of the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.380
 foreign minister as president of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:29.420
 Chancellor of the Federal Chancellor 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.420
 that means higher momentum 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.920
 also like out 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.580
 No 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.460
 you like about ceremonies like that 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.320
 Receiving military honor thinking 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.810
 as you like but we have ours 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.700
 talk in the studio for a moment 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.070
 interrupted at least once the 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.530
 to make a bitch audible and around 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.070
 to be able to watch carefully 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.920
 what exactly happens there because the 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.680
 difference to a visit to the 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.820
 then maybe around 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.460
 trade relations goes and then 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.200
 maybe a little harmless too 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.850
 Themes of difference to one 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.640
 Of course, it is such a visit today 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.790
 is also about military issues it goes 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.190
 even about a war in Ukraine it 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.690
 is also about military 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.790
 disputes where Germany for 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.010
 must define to what extent it is 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.690
 it would be ready in vivaldis 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.550
 possibly weapons to deliver to what extent it 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.500
 would be ready in any way 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.630
 you always kind to participate 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.000
 so far, of course, has one 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.840
 ceremonial on such a day maybe 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.840
 still a deeper meaning
