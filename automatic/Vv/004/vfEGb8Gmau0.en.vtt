00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.369

 interesting in this game and with maps 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.350
 Look at China, what madness was good. 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.510
 polished and moves very differently too 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.750

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.620
 assassin's creed pairs who is the one who 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.110
 showed you 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 already in the matter that it has gained to see everything alone 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 for mobile as much as for 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.940
 android will command 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.730
 there the character even so the critics 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.460
 but it will only stay on your ship 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.489
 against the population and also trying to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.469
 control the seven seas behind other 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.409
 ships behind treasures that will 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.110
 to have too many cannonballs 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.120
