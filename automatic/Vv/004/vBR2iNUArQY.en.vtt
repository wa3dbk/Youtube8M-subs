 molina de aragón and the basin range will also provide advice 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.729
 personalized to more than five hundred 49 people and it is estimated that about 5 thousand 600 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.490

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.449
 233 hectares help 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.940
 workers are not for unemployed workers to improve their preparation and 

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:57.920
 your job prospects 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.080
 and can also serve as a bridge between employment policy 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.820
 very important at this time the economic situation that we 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.310
 we find in many Spanish rural areas 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.090
 and environmental policy 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940
 and with a double objective 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.140
 first that the environment and sustainability 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.439
 be the basis for better jobs and more competitive companies 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.810
 And in second place 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.610
 that workers and companies are key players in improving the environment 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 environment and in the sustainability of rural development we want 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.130
 make a bet a clear 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.880
 because this activity is fulfilled by the truffle we believe that yes no good 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.210
 alternative for de facto the land psoe of the mill areas of 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.369
 Aragón and the Serrania de Cuenca 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.700
 in this project have been based on the phase of cultivation of troops 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.539
 Later, other agreements will be signed to promote 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.670
 marketing of that tuber 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.890
 Finally, point to this agreement, it is also expected to contribute to the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.470
 creation of 15 companies 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
 mack 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.380
