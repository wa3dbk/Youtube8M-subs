limbic<00:00:10.850> imprinting<00:00:11.720> is<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.889> same<00:00:13.330> mechanism

limbic imprinting is the same mechanism

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.929 
limbic imprinting is the same mechanism
that<00:00:15.460> we<00:00:16.460> know<00:00:17.410> for<00:00:18.410> thousands<00:00:19.040> of<00:00:19.130> years<00:00:19.490> that

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
people knew for centuries that if we

natural to them that connection with God
is<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:52.480> normal<00:00:53.480> state<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.989> being<00:00:54.230> because<00:00:54.910> the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
is a normal state of being because the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.389 
is a normal state of being because the
reality<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.629> there<00:00:57.230> is<00:00:57.410> never<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.950> moment

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
reality is that there is never a moment

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.939 
reality is that there is never a moment

it's<00:01:02.690> just<00:01:02.989> our<00:01:03.140> ability<00:01:03.469> to<00:01:03.890> perceive<00:01:04.309> that

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's just our ability to perceive that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.070 
it's just our ability to perceive that
that's<00:01:05.840> what<00:01:06.140> limbic<00:01:06.530> imprint<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:11.080> therefore

that's what limbic imprint is therefore

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.060 
that's what limbic imprint is therefore
we're<00:01:12.890> either<00:01:13.390> have<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.420> or<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:15.409> don't<00:01:15.650> have<00:01:15.890> it

we're either have it or we don't have it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.250 
we're either have it or we don't have it
and<00:01:16.280> then<00:01:16.490> spend<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:17.030> lifetime<00:01:17.240> trying<00:01:17.869> to

and then spend a lifetime trying to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.960 
and then spend a lifetime trying to
achieve<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.000> because<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:22.040> connection<00:01:22.729> with

achieve it because the connection with

it's there unless we were hammered on
the<00:01:32.119> exit<00:01:33.189> into<00:01:34.189> oblivion<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.590> forgetting

the exit into oblivion and forgetting

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
who we are why are we here again what

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.929 
who we are why are we here again what
what<00:01:40.759> was<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.090> reason<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.900> in<00:01:42.680> creating<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
what was the reason of in creating and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.670 
what was the reason of in creating and
manifesting<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.930> three-dimensional

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
manifesting the three-dimensional

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.740 
manifesting the three-dimensional
reality<00:01:46.540> what<00:01:47.540> was<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.840> thinking

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
reality what was I thinking

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.580 
reality what was I thinking
but<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.619> really<00:01:52.479> what<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.659> comes<00:01:54.049> down<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
but it's really what it comes down to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.889 
but it's really what it comes down to
because<00:01:54.829> I'm<00:01:55.220> noticing<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:56.090> people<00:01:56.149> who<00:01:56.720> are

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
because I'm noticing that people who are

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.990 
because I'm noticing that people who are
not<00:01:56.930> traumatized<00:01:57.799> during<00:01:58.159> their<00:01:58.579> formative

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
period they know who they are they

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.289 
period they know who they are they
remember<00:02:02.689> why<00:02:02.869> they<00:02:03.079> came<00:02:03.350> here<00:02:03.770> they<00:02:04.460> don't

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
remember why they came here they don't

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.780 
remember why they came here they don't
have<00:02:05.570> fear<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.259> their<00:02:06.500> eyes<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:07.189> they

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
have fear in their eyes that they

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.590 
have fear in their eyes that they
connect<00:02:08.540> directly<00:02:09.850> instantly<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.269> not<00:02:11.570> a

connect directly instantly it's not a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.560 
connect directly instantly it's not a
job<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.320> them<00:02:12.470> they<00:02:12.920> just<00:02:13.310> don't<00:02:14.239> know

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
job for them they just don't know

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
it was very well exploited throughout

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.960 
it was very well exploited throughout
millennia<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:48.220> from<00:02:49.860> what<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:50.890> understand<00:02:51.579> it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
millennia and from what I understand it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.949 
millennia and from what I understand it
was<00:02:52.450> deliberately<00:02:53.140> used<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:55.060> early<00:02:55.660> cultures

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
was deliberately used in early cultures

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.910

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
something that they called limbic

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.839 
something that they called limbic
imprint<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:08.470> fancy<00:03:08.950> name<00:03:09.160> came<00:03:09.819> from

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
imprint this fancy name came from

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.360 
imprint this fancy name came from
prenatal<00:03:10.359> psychology<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.530> very<00:03:11.739> recently

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
prenatal psychology just very recently

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.000 
prenatal psychology just very recently
in<00:03:12.700> human<00:03:12.910> history<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.560> nevertheless<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.590> was

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
in human history but nevertheless it was

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.030 
in human history but nevertheless it was
used<00:03:18.390> for<00:03:19.410> mammals<00:03:20.609> including<00:03:21.609> humans<00:03:23.040> there

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
used for mammals including humans there

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.890 
used for mammals including humans there
was<00:03:24.250> many<00:03:24.549> ways<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:26.310> creating<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:28.060> specific

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
childhood it's actually created from the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.470 
childhood it's actually created from the
moment<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.099> conception<00:03:52.169> so<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:55.060> gets<00:03:55.329> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
moment of conception so it gets a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.940 
moment of conception so it gets a
trickier<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:57.549> work<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:58.260> but<00:03:59.260> then<00:03:59.500> there

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
trickier to to work with but then there

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.140 
trickier to to work with but then there
is<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.160> moment<00:04:00.489> when<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:02.129> becomes<00:04:03.150> intolerable

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
