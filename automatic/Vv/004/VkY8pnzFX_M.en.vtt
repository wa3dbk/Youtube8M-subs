00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
other kids it would be peers and if they

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.350 
other kids it would be peers and if they
live<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.399> an<00:00:44.460> environment<00:00:44.879> where<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.210> to

live in an environment where they get to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
live in an environment where they get to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
listening the radio reading you know
comic<00:00:49.410> books<00:00:49.620> we'd<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> media

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
comic books we'd have to say the media

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.069 
comic books we'd have to say the media
but<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.870> bet<00:00:52.110> those<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> top<00:00:53.160> two

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
but I would bet those are the top two

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
but I would bet those are the top two
sources<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> were<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.399> where

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
sources that if you were to say where

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
sources that if you were to say where
does<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> language<00:00:57.780> come<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.039> these

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
does the language come from that these

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.450 
does the language come from that these
kids<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.030> most<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:01.649> those<00:01:02.250> would

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
kids get the most of right those would

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
kids get the most of right those would
be<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> top<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.149> what's<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> number<00:01:04.500> three

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
tends to sink to the lowest common

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.359 
tends to sink to the lowest common

is<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> bad<00:01:54.840> idea<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.799> children<00:01:56.270> children<00:01:57.270> will

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
is a bad idea for children children will
always<00:01:57.780> develop<00:01:58.380> better<00:01:58.680> language<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.549> they

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
always develop better language if they

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.270 
always develop better language if they
can<00:02:00.090> spend<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.719> time<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.680> people<00:02:01.920> who<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
can spend more time with people who are
