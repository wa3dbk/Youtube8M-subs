00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
ever happened and if so how come the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.860 
ever happened and if so how come the
flag<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.340> blowing<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> wind<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.780> for

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
flag is blowing in the wind it's for

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.660 
flag is blowing in the wind it's for
another<00:03:00.049> level<00:03:00.319> there<00:03:00.470> are<00:03:00.500> they<00:03:00.769> we've<00:03:01.160> we've

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
another level there are they we've we've

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.970 
another level there are they we've we've
I<00:03:02.239> don't<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.140> moon<00:03:03.319> has<00:03:03.470> ever<00:03:03.650> landed

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
I don't think the moon has ever landed

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.830 
I don't think the moon has ever landed
on<00:03:04.099> earth<00:03:04.130> at<00:03:04.430> all<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.819> think<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.630> might<00:03:05.810> have

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
on earth at all I think we might have

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.960 
on earth at all I think we might have
landed<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.319> moon<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.799> think<00:03:07.010> when<00:03:07.940> we

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
landed on the moon and I think when we

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.120 
landed on the moon and I think when we
did<00:03:08.329> was<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.959> pretty<00:03:09.579> stupendous<00:03:10.579> moment<00:03:10.970> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
did was a pretty stupendous moment and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.620 
did was a pretty stupendous moment and
as<00:03:13.130> for<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.519> flag<00:03:13.790> I'm<00:03:14.000> not<00:03:14.150> sure<00:03:14.359> if<00:03:14.480> it's

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
as for the flag I'm not sure if it's

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.580 
as for the flag I'm not sure if it's
still<00:03:14.780> there<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.079> probably<00:03:15.319> rotted<00:03:15.530> away

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
still there is probably rotted away

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.289 
still there is probably rotted away
isn't<00:03:15.889> it<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.609> you're<00:03:16.760> saying<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.060> did<00:03:17.209> happen
