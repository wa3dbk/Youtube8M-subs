00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
with the mileage they got from it but

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.030 
with the mileage they got from it but
the<00:01:11.310> performance<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.830> they<00:01:13.830> never

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the performance was just they never

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.249 
the performance was just they never
experienced<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
experienced it before so that's one of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.570 
experienced it before so that's one of
the<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.680> unique<00:01:16.860> things<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the really unique things about this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
the really unique things about this
particular<00:01:18.030> tire<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.110> 95%<00:01:19.619> fitment

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
particular tire we do have 95% fitment

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
particular tire we do have 95% fitment
for<00:01:20.340> harley-davidson<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> tire<00:01:21.570> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
for harley-davidson with this tire we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
for harley-davidson with this tire we
just<00:01:22.619> added<00:01:22.799> 14<00:01:23.310> new<00:01:23.490> sizes<00:01:24.000> that's<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
just added 14 new sizes that's kind of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
just added 14 new sizes that's kind of
branched<00:01:24.840> us<00:01:24.930> off<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> metric<00:01:25.890> side<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
branched us off into the metric side of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
branched us off into the metric side of
things<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.840> sizes<00:01:28.380> for

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
things as well so I do have sizes for

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880 
things as well so I do have sizes for
example<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> VTX<00:01:29.939> 1800<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.689> vcx<00:01:31.170> 1300

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
example like on a VTX 1800 or vcx 1300

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.590 
example like on a VTX 1800 or vcx 1300
as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:33.030> getting<00:01:33.180> more<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.540> more

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
as well so we're getting more and more

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
as well so we're getting more and more
metric<00:01:34.530> sizes<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.729> particular<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
metric sizes in this particular one you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.700
