00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.450
 I take a few shots I took a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.920

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.020
 after maxime icart you said me good of him and we said it was 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.490
 foiled at two weeks 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 when he won time to worry awesome awesome enough 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.340
 impressive to your violence every time he's scared of nothing and that's all 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.610
 the fleets 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.180
 his uprising they are attacking all the time the blinds Cholet short stack 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 we do not really want to defend the savanna even a little more melted lost a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.580
 moment of a big blow for him at the beginning of the game I resumed a normal course at 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 final it's going pretty well 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.470
 tomorrow we will resume knowing the table and the edge of the table a little 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 a little bent so I hope he will give everything what you 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.530
 know if you have the same table tomorrow then at the same table even sky it 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 there is no draw 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.619
 the new draw a new draw as for me i love you to his 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.790
 contemporary 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.260
 novices but besides that's why it's used to what we try to contain 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.230
 of the rise of sport tomorrow 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.420
 it's very good time I think I understand it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.400
 very well and as for the idea then hours to his chances with any 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.099
 the day 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.689
 but also at the time it was a moment t 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.809
 had three movements in the lead the day I really fought I had a 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:14.560
 small carpet 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.559
 victor says 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.419
 the players in a way that is equal to the bosses 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.939
 and then at al-qaida finally took at the end of the day I was brought to the right 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.379
 Antoine in his high is the first time you play with opac 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 to future champions of the world so here is a purchase 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.829
 while the year before rugged with 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.810
 451-1 it seems they have full heart 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.099
 both young and talented just to finish my favorite fashion 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.459
 valves as an employee we have compared it to jesus apart 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.790
 he does not have long hair like yourself 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.450
 but other than that it's a similar project 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.399
 sincerely when he hit 1 loses 2 5 times for at 4 5 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.709

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.700
 aeration time 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.619

 to grubbing up because you've paid for happened to create direction and 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.489
 they deviate winon summer after montreal 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.049
 to show up before a member of the mafia subject 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.689
 to eat bread 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.969
 I thought I was throwing three sets of 40 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.279
 ima triplets and on the live 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.859
 and to make their moment of violence and I got bored of a triple face 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.430
 to pass article lurking so 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.400
 this is already a little too much for is more than 40 to 70 8 in June this cause 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.270
 ap ap ap ap 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.270
 finally do not propose six years as a member to do this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.699
 after the flop came 3 5 8 c is the continuation of datacell week 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.709
 I am shot down a city policeman boast of vended up to shut up 

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.130
 rajai shahr a45 but he held his head we added 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.169
 it is very well to be 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.110
 he ended up polt obama 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.110
 I'm going to train because I had to assume that I have to the mother 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.599
 I'm not sure yet he told me yes I had two more hours to have 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.039
 a pair of four in the same situation really thought it very 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.299
 very long good and david villa the question that everyone is asking this is 

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.469
 this famous hand 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.139
 a couple of players a little excited just now there are ladies 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.810
 e valets 8x ladies and two hearts author who thought a long time 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.490
 kill 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.240
 you become what you went to the gall to keep it for you there must have been 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.560
 first accused of murder 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.620
 because the pair of new in celebration is what she will make a point on the 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.360
 decision 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.879
 because with hindsight it seems easy 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.270
 about the very moment in his answer for having a day after having disputed 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.879
 a simple act that we all said looking at the hand but that makes 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.719
 which for all that excited all the time max to spend a possible transfer in the 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.399
 sentinel but that's enough for the reserve and his famous starts his voice 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.389
 value 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.409
 it's okay it's the face auxerre that I remember in the end what is done 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.710
 over there 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.740
 but it's good but it was worth it 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.740
 so eliminated 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.719
 well done then maybe here's thank you guys and we give ourselves an appointment 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.389
 tomorrow our Belgian friends 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.260
 It's a plus
