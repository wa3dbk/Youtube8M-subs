00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
some bison testicles today and so I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.280 
some bison testicles today and so I
figured<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.360> still<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> little<00:00:33.870> frozen

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
figured and it's still a little frozen

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310 
figured and it's still a little frozen
but<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.920> sure<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.020> let<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
but I'm sure that you can just let it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.139 
but I'm sure that you can just let it
melt<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.739> mouth

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
so what a wonderful turn these guys onto

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.170 
so what a wonderful turn these guys onto
some<00:00:41.520> real<00:00:41.700> powerful<00:00:43.129> testosterone<00:00:44.180> these

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
some real powerful testosterone these

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.459 
some real powerful testosterone these
guys<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:45.600> they've<00:00:45.930> recently<00:00:46.140> ate

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
guys actually they've recently ate

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.069 
guys actually they've recently ate
turkey<00:00:46.860> testicles<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.000> how'd<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.570> go

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
turkey testicles so how'd it go

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
turkey testicles so how'd it go
we<00:00:49.230> killed<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> turkey<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> spot<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> he

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
we killed the turkey on the spot and he

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
we killed the turkey on the spot and he
took<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> testicles<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:56.809> was<00:00:57.809> gnarly

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
took the testicles out it was gnarly

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
took the testicles out it was gnarly
I<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> whole<00:00:58.859> device<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> roof<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> my

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
I have a whole device in the roof of my

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
I have a whole device in the roof of my
mouth<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> turkey<00:01:00.870> testicle<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.440> caught

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
mouth and the turkey testicle got caught

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.530 
mouth and the turkey testicle got caught
up<00:01:01.859> there

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.320 

so<00:01:08.500> because<00:01:09.010> this<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.370> little<00:01:09.640> animalistic

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
so because this is a little animalistic

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.760 
so because this is a little animalistic
it's<00:01:10.630> best<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> handle<00:01:11.320> it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
it's best to handle it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.730 
it's best to handle it
animal<00:01:12.130> style<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.870> it's<00:01:14.080> still<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.440> little<00:01:14.590> bit

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
animal style so it's still a little bit

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.390 
animal style so it's still a little bit
frozen<00:01:15.120> but<00:01:16.120> they<00:01:16.300> are<00:01:16.800> they're<00:01:17.800> fresh<00:01:18.220> I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
frozen but they are they're fresh I

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600 
frozen but they are they're fresh I
bought<00:01:18.550> up<00:01:18.670> today<00:01:18.970> from<00:01:19.240> Linda<00:01:19.540> bison<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
bought up today from Linda bison and the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.090 
bought up today from Linda bison and the
best<00:01:21.820> way<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.030> do<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:23.410> dig<00:01:23.620> in<00:01:23.860> I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
best way to do it is just to dig in I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.220 
best way to do it is just to dig in I
have<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.520> kimchi<00:01:25.000> right<00:01:25.420> here<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.020> then<00:01:26.140> of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
have the kimchi right here and then of

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.640 
have the kimchi right here and then of
course<00:01:26.260> we<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:26.770> wash<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.040> down<00:01:27.370> with<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
course we can wash it down with the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.880 
course we can wash it down with the
kefir<00:01:29.650> kombucha<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.480> but<00:01:32.470> ultimately

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
kefir kombucha and so but ultimately

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.220 
kefir kombucha and so but ultimately
it's<00:01:33.280> all<00:01:33.610> about<00:01:34.060> getting<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.630> energy<00:01:34.870> and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
it's all about getting that energy and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.870 
it's all about getting that energy and
that<00:01:35.290> testosterone<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.190> guys<00:01:36.370> tell<00:01:36.640> me<00:01:36.790> if

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that testosterone you guys tell me if

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.910 
that testosterone you guys tell me if
you<00:01:37.000> feel<00:01:37.270> like<00:01:37.450> I'll<00:01:37.780> tell<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.230> exactly<00:01:38.500> when

there's<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.390> solution<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> next<00:01:53.140> level<00:01:53.410> for

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
there's a solution to the next level for

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.270 
there's a solution to the next level for
sure

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
sure

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.090
