00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.270
 a huge hello to everyone and today we have 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.000
 will be so at the request of my some 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.280
 subscriber asked me to make a video tag 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.470
 I hope my wardrobe is what I found 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.900
 correct questions of this tag 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.660
 but in any case I will answer exactly 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.050
 those questions that I found them will be 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.869
 seven 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.720
 these questions well let's begin the first 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.660
 the question is the oldest thing in my 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.880
 wardrobe of course i have a very 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.630
 old things in the wardrobe that are stored 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.610
 somewhere there I don't know some bins but 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.830
 Of course, these things will not show me 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.370
 show you the oldest thing of those 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.000
 which I which I wear and still and 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.310
 this thing is such jeans 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.470
 ordinary jeans can say it even 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.560
 such dzhekins and because they just 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.710
 super duper skin-tight and I bought them 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.590
 probably in 2010 in my year that is 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.570
 4 probably already even in 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.510
 principle can say almost five years 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.689
 back the store Gloria Jeans and still 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.999
 they are absolutely in perfect condition i 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.859
 Of course I don’t wear them often 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.770
 I still wear them because they 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.530
 very nice to sit on a beautiful figure 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.100
 emphasize and still have their 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 presentable appearance and so we go 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.179
 next is the newest thing 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.520
 my wardrobe 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.490
 but surely you have already seen my new 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.670
 things were there if you were following my vlogs 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.920
 but I will show you one of these newest 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.859
 the things that you bought recently are you 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.619
 such here leggings from the store in New York 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.959
 they come with leather inserts very i 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.840
 Loved the last time leggings 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.450
 this is a very very handy thing to everyone all 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 I advise at any time of the year especially at 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.459
 it's colder like now 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.709
 great leggings and this is my 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.740
 the newest thing in the wardrobe 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:04.719
 But I think that they are waiting for me too soon 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.439
 new things further the most expensive thing of my 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.880
 wardrobe 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.920
 surely 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.090
 expensive things my wardrobe is 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 is an 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.550
 but outerwear because they think and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.090
 so it is clear that outerwear is always 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.550
 costs much more than the rest and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.130
 I'll show you the most different one now. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.580
 the thing in the wardrobe is of course 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.800
 such a coat is a coat with a present 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.550
 fur is natural here it is 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.670
 the scribe and it was worth it in my coat no I 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.670
 I don't remember exactly, but I think about 16,000 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.230
 here is a winter coat but very very warm 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.930
 so this is my dearest 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.830
 my wardrobe thing 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:56.500
 so comes next further is the most 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.630
 the cheapest thing is my wardrobe but the most 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.190
 the cheap things in the wardrobe are 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.099
 of course some boys or 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.190
 tee shirt but here and so offhand 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.470
 Has found the cheapest this is a shirt 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.170
 From the store Gloria Jeans, I bought it 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.359
 oh this and she was still there 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.359
 sale at that time, and probably for 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:19.269
 I bought my shirt for 100 rubles 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.190
 I believe so but let's 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.560
 this will be my cheapest thing 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.489
 my wardrobe 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.019
 next is my best buy for 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.930
 its the best buy me 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.510
 will have to go down but here I am 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.609
 here and my best buy is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.250
 there were such wonderful boots 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.560
 They are from genuine leather from genuine 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.450
 suede leather then there suede 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.069
 natural fur inside 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.590
 why it seemed the most profitable 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.170
 purchase and the fact is that initially the price 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.019
 These boots were in my seven with 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.389
 half night about 8 thousand rubles but 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.489
 I bought for only five thousand rubles 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.549
 because there was only one 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.739
 the size that is of the type and therefore the price was 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.530
 discounted since the size was left alone and 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.079
 it was just my size 38 and therefore 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.890
 I can safely consider this purchase well 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.020
 probably 1 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.460
 of those most profitable 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.200
 because the quality is good all 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.690
 natural and they are very warm and 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.109
 comfortable winter boots 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.280
 very nice cool look further 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:28.270
 the next question is the most unprofitable 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.580
 buying from my wardrobe and the most not 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.520
 bargain my wardrobe well 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.860
 you know, it will probably be this one 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.140
 payment of course now absolutely 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.150
 nothing is clear how it looks on 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.430
 hanger and maybe it looks at all 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.380
 awful but on the figure but it looks 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.330
 good enough this dress is me 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.480
 ordered the site lamoda 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.080
 and why I think this dress and this 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.390
 purchase 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.970
 most unfavorable in the first place because I 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.340
 I think that the price of this dress was but 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.890
 definitely say so overstated because 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.940
 that she's kind of not bad but of course 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.580
 same stuff here 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.530
 but so cheap enough and I think 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.260
 which could have been much cheaper to buy 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.419
 like a dress and and also this purchase I 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.790
 I consider it unprofitable and because it cost on 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.800
 Well, not really really cheap but it's 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.800
 I plan to wear a dress only 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.990
 only one time for a new year 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.740
 Well, there is a party I do not know if I will 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.750
 still wear it sometime 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.370
 schedule these at once for New Year 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.979
 corporate on a hanger but it looks 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.900
 very really somehow useless but on the figure 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.930
 she looks good but nonetheless 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.910
 nothing else came to mind 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.580
 This question except this dress well 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.280
 and the last question is my favorite 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.010
 three wardrobe things in general actually 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.050
 I love almost all my stuff 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.050
 which I wear is not my way 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.419
 like it but the question was so what 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.390
 need to choose exactly 3 and 3 I can 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.770
 choose this first you are such a skirt and 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.080
 from bershka shop 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.570
 I love her very much 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.970
 first she has a beautiful color I just 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.090
 I love this one color and do not like 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.479
 her styles and texture and and fabric as she 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.510
 Made in the back such a lock here in front 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.310
 pockets and and here it is 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.840
 uneven she has such a cut I love but 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.390
 things with some interesting cut 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.160
 for example in this skirt there is a jagged edge 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.710
 below it will be with such a smell 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.010
 looks very stylish and very cool 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.230
 the same again costs my my darling 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.480
 red sweater i just adore him 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.880
 very cozy again he has a very 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.940
 an interesting cut in front of the water and let us go 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.980
 shorter in front it is longer and 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.130
 also made such a triangle on 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.900
 one side also here is a zipper on the side and she 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.300
 stretched altogether very cozy 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.720
 cool sweater I just love it and 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.000
 another my favorite thing that I 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.610
 also recently acquired a store 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.040

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.500
 very cool tarragon it is very soft and 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.870
 very nice when I don’t wear it 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.390
 somehow it's very warm in it very comfortable 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.890
 I like him madly and it seems to me 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.530
 her he really goes i like him 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.210

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.130
 I know I like it very much and generally 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.560
 probably at the moment it's just 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.570
 the most most my favorite thing 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.640
