really significant impact on this kid we

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.739 
really significant impact on this kid we
did<00:00:15.860> while<00:00:16.429> there<00:00:16.609> are<00:00:16.640> submarines<00:00:17.300> that<00:00:17.449> same

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:17.749 
did while there are submarines that same

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.450 
did while there are submarines that same
a<00:00:17.869> key<00:00:17.929> skill<00:00:18.050> console<00:00:18.560> asking<00:00:18.980> more<00:00:19.099> damage

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
a key skill console asking more damage

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.950 
a key skill console asking more damage
we<00:00:19.910> wanted<00:00:20.179> there<00:00:20.329> to<00:00:20.359> be<00:00:20.449> rooms<00:00:20.779> that

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
we wanted there to be rooms that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.749 
we wanted there to be rooms that
completely<00:00:21.349> change<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.039> game<00:00:22.249> play<00:00:22.490> in<00:00:22.640> the

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
completely change the game play in the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.300 
completely change the game play in the
skin<00:00:22.999> so<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:24.199> encourages<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:25.009> lot<00:00:25.220> of

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
skin so it encourages a lot of

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.220 
skin so it encourages a lot of
experimentation<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.329> can<00:00:26.480> put<00:00:26.689> rooms<00:00:26.960> into

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
experimentation you can put rooms into

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.749 
experimentation you can put rooms into
the<00:00:27.409> skills<00:00:27.679> and<00:00:27.859> take<00:00:28.009> them<00:00:28.189> out<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:28.339> get

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
the skills and take them out and get

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.390 
the skills and take them out and get
locked<00:00:28.999> in<00:00:29.319> so<00:00:30.319> you<00:00:30.380> kind<00:00:30.769> of<00:00:30.829> mix<00:00:31.099> them<00:00:31.279> up

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
locked in so you kind of mix them up

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.310 
locked in so you kind of mix them up
however<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:31.849> want<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.660> as<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.899> find<00:00:33.140> your

y'all like explode right we have a
finger<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.270> pulse<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.780> Diablo

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
finger on the pulse of the Diablo

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.740

audience<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> skillet<00:02:00.360> language

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
audience so skillet language

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.790 
audience so skillet language
multi-stripe<00:02:01.350> passes

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.200 

and<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.980> cool<00:02:12.190> thing<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.730> further<00:02:13.000> away

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
and the cool thing is the further away

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.390 
and the cool thing is the further away
throughout<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.080> longer<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> balance<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.250> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
throughout the longer the balance so it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
throughout the longer the balance so it
really<00:02:15.610> has<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.060> gauge<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.390> sugar<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.650> power

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
really has to gauge like sugar so power

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.250 
really has to gauge like sugar so power
actually<00:02:18.700> leaves<00:02:18.970> burning<00:02:19.300> areas<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.960> great

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
actually leaves burning areas of great

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.500 
actually leaves burning areas of great
that<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.520> have<00:02:21.640> monsters<00:02:22.000> walk<00:02:22.210> through

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
that you can have monsters walk through

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.380 
that you can have monsters walk through
and<00:02:22.720> take<00:02:22.840> additional<00:02:23.080> damage<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.030> system

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
and take additional damage so the system

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.490 
and take additional damage so the system
really<00:02:28.600> got<00:02:28.870> us<00:02:29.020> booked

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
really got us booked

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.450 
really got us booked
I<00:02:31.630> guess<00:02:32.630> still<00:02:32.930> looks<00:02:33.230> kitchen<00:02:33.710> every<00:02:34.250> time

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I guess still looks kitchen every time

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.670 
I guess still looks kitchen every time
with<00:02:34.730> every<00:02:35.000> player<00:02:35.270> uses<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.110> based<00:02:36.320> on<00:02:36.470> what

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
with every player uses it based on what

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.160 
with every player uses it based on what
the<00:02:36.830> players<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.940> that's<00:02:38.000> good<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.020> here

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the players like and that's good so here

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.870 
the players like and that's good so here
we<00:02:39.260> have<00:02:39.290> basically<00:02:39.770> reduce<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.520> kind<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
we have basically reduce is kind of the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.410 
we have basically reduce is kind of the
last<00:02:41.000> killer<00:02:41.680> show<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.340> basically<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.300> know

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
last killer show so basically you know

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.030 
last killer show so basically you know
it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.430 

which<00:02:49.040> would<00:02:49.190> put<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.900> first<00:02:51.170> one<00:02:51.350> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
which would put in a in the first one is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.540 
which would put in a in the first one is
a<00:02:51.470> multi<00:02:51.920> stripe<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:54.260> really<00:02:54.590> ups<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
a multi stripe this really ups the the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:05.330 
a multi stripe this really ups the the
Chain<00:02:55.880> Lightning<00:02:56.120> aspect<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.320> skill

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.790 

so<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.670> last<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.210> leak<00:03:07.450> nominee<00:03:07.870> without

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
so in the last is a leak nominee without

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.930 
so in the last is a leak nominee without
a<00:03:08.880> potentially<00:03:09.930> oil
