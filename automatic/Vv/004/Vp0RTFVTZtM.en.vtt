00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.710

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 Experts talk from fit and healthy 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.630
 and I greet with me in the studio 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.560
 woman dr tanja fischer she is dermatologist 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.570
 here in Berlin 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 hello welcome what is it 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.800
 actually the cause that one one 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.600
 skin can ever skim over 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 used skin is usually at the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.410
 Rich cream applied too often 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.760
 that means we never need them 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.320
 closed and thereby can 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.269
 Bacteria form and it comes to these 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.550
 little postel education and pecking 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.350
 So I'm putting too much of it on whole 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.239
 up and hang so a bit 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 of what in this cream now in it 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.629
 is therefore certain ingredients 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.339
 fly over responsible home yes 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.780
 the ingredients are essential 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.720
 important so there are, for example 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.479
 Ingredients such as parabens where you 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.030
 can also trigger a sensitivity 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.650
 or papa substances are common 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 which is just too rich that is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 too fatty and i can 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 Imagine that I say okay I suppose 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.210
 now a cream and use it 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.100
 simply as a lot too much 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 or is in the cream too much in it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.250
 both often it is a one too many at 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.260
 apply 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.060
 but even if that's too content 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.130
 are also small quantities sufficient that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.840
 these pores are blocked what would have to be 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.640
 because then the ideal care trenches 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.229
 Do not include these over care 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.490
 takes place so it comes on the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.500
 skin type on it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.939
 if you have a rather dry skin 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.299
 then she can also oils 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.789
 but contain even larger pores 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.640
 or something the skin needs to be oily 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.920
 Moisture contains good daytime 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.719
 to have of sun protection and easy 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.460
 maybe less is less 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.590
 Ingredients so little 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.240
 explored of such a good one 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 they actually have to get to the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.909
 Daily routine are adapted during the day 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.380
 sunscreens what are you doing here 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.210
 In the evening you can also good for 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 regeneration maybe a taxi 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.420
 have dancing or vitamins 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.500
 that's always good for the guy too 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.490
 sleep that she got better 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.680
 can regenerate 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.300
 how many times do I have to go to the skin? 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.700
 clean with care products 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.740
 usually enough clean twice 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.540
 daily morning and evening and above all 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.100
 In the morning cleaning is for the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.720
 fresh I feel very comfortable though 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.870
 In the evening is much more important that you too 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.600
 really easy she cleans from the day of 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.860
 from the dust and make up and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.270
 that you just go to bed 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 I really have to go in the evening 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
 Just such a thing really do too 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.790
 mechanically these dander 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.590
 to write off no not too much 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.350
 a man of the week is certainly enough 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.030
 with young skin rather less there 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.160
 sometimes make almost too much and thereby 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.020
 it comes after his overflies 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.490
 when I go to the store and me 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.290
 Buy a cream and I'm not sure 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.970
 if I can tolerate this cream well 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.920
 how can I test yourself because without 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.510
 now go to the dermatologist so is a whole 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.250
 a simple test is, for example, a bend 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 that you just start a cream in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.640
 the bend or the lateral corner of the eye 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.200
 just have it now or just 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.670
 at the side of the eyes if she was also the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.320
 skin is very sensitive and if you are 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.730
 the well tolerates the next day one 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.990
 redness has you know that they are good 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.100
 tolerates and probably is the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.080
 booty even better is the lateral 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.700
 Eye angle in the prey you will not 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.100
 see if I reacted 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.140
 how is that for shaving now ? 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.370
 how can i be especially gentle on 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.470
 shave my skin 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.600
 so if men's skin is sensitive it is 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.980
 but the wet shave recommended because 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.380
 this simply makes the skin moister 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.050
 the rule has made softer and gentler 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.630
 if you go with the hair with your hair 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.800
 You can simply shave the skin 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.110
 Treat very gently 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.880
 that means keeping it moist 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.230
 and then from top to bottom with the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.160
 domination and not against office 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.380
 then it is a bit more difficult 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.420
 shave or so it comes down to so 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.550
 men who tolerate it well 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.500
 haag strokes that is of course always 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.750
 possible but some grow their hair 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.670
 easier one or the other and 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 I have to flare my skin then 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.290
 to prepare for the shave 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.150
 actually no by this wet shave 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.430
 prepares one imagines by the one 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.070
 comes and once and thereby becomes skin 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.690
 and the hair is just farther then 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
 the shave is much lighter and easier 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.540
 but if I'm looking for a dry one so 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.940
 decide then I have to make up what 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.650
 before or no for it never but one 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.540
 Dry shave is mostly for the men 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.459
 anyway a bit more robust skin 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.140
 have and have no problems 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.720
 What has always interested me 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.340
 Shaving so after the shave must 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.480
 because you really disinfect his skin 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.820
 I do not do that I shave myself 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.020
 like that and leave everything as it is in the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.840
 usually you do not have the skin 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.070
 generally disinfect alcohol dry 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.760
 the skin is still a bit more and 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.590
 sensitive skin has alcoholic 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.690
 aftershave not like it but in the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.430
 new balsam are often vitamins 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.160
 contain vitamin b for example what 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.020
 Just get the skin back quickly 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.670
 barrier-free so that this 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.800
 After lotions really makes a lot of sense 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.420
 are not that in mine 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.770
 bathroom cabinet reingucken arises there 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.570
 maybe a care potty for 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.190
 me and certainly ten nursing pots 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.960
 for my wife i am from mine 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.120
 Woman just worn and me her 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.640
 borrowing cream usually it is like this 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.990
 that the women just too rich 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.370
 I'm going to put a manskin on it anyway 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.350
 that's why we have a little cousin 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.000
 often less wrinkles in old age 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.380
 that means you should already know this 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.150
 pay attention that is important too 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.310
 one also guesses wont 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.080
 Sun protection in the morning makes sense but 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.300
 more women's creams are mostly too 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.010
 rich and how do I hold now 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.420
 my skin so that they last as long as possible 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.730
 looks young 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.130
 the simplest is really that one 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.890
 in the morning simply a sunscreen 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.510
 the sun is applied by the sun V makes power 80 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.130
 percent of the skin also wrinkles on the face 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.120
 in men and that is true now 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.280
 for women and men so exactly 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.620
 There are so many new methods in place right now 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.870
 So dermatology in medicine 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.760
 to rejuvenate the skin there is 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.670
 something very special where they are 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.680
 I would say that, as I said 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.180
 Sunscreen has become so easy and 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.020
 strikingly that's really extreme 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.730
 important but also for example higher 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.520
 acids simply moisturise the skin 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.160
 hold or even urea- containing 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.830
 Substances simply serve this purpose 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.470
 that the skin stays intact and 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.270
 thereby massive skin protection is created 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.220
 but here ours is actually called 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.200
 in a cream in it and not in one 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.720
 injection into the folds exactly 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.890
 So in the cream inside so is 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.540
 just the horn layer something 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.640
 failed and you look a bit 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.160
 Plumper off if you can get too 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.350
 is also the effect away but it does 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.730
 just the skin smoother and thereby is 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.080
 just a very pleasant feeling 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.760
 But so is the skin does not keep young 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.440
 but young but at this moment sees 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.240
 They just look younger from the height 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.380
 ours is also where it should be 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.760
 I'll tell you if I'm a schnitzel 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.800
 I 'll lie on my stomach 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.050
 also not full and hyaluronic acid 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.880
 maybe not exactly that 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.950
 no real folding therapy but 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.419
 it once makes the skin barrier safe 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.220
 that simply means fewer bacteria 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.169
 can penetrate even after shaving 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.150
 and it just looks quite well from I 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.160
 because it 's just so humid 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.750
 stops and calls down and toasty 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.390
 looking also means looking healthy and 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.440
 the 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.970
 I think the skin is the best 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.290
 Many thanks for that mirror today 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.290
 want to study then he will happen
