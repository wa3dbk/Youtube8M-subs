uploaded<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.780> don't<00:03:29.020> know<00:03:29.110> why<00:03:29.320> but<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
uploaded it I don't know why but I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.980 
uploaded it I don't know why but I
really<00:03:30.670> know<00:03:30.760> YouTube's<00:03:31.150> back<00:03:31.510> it's<00:03:31.720> second

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
really know YouTube's back it's second

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.660 
really know YouTube's back it's second
grade<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:32.890> third<00:03:33.100> grade<00:03:33.340> that's<00:03:33.520> when<00:03:33.580> I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
grade so or third grade that's when I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.200 
grade so or third grade that's when I
think<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:33.940> found<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.240> out<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:34.960> yeah<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:37.090> is

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
think I found it out but yeah this is

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.970 
think I found it out but yeah this is
probably<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.750> easiest<00:03:37.840> way<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.200> find<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.650> mr.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
probably the easiest way to find a mr.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.040 
probably the easiest way to find a mr.
or<00:03:39.160> get<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> mr.<00:03:39.760> whoopee<00:03:40.090> they're<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:40.900> that

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.260 
or get a mr. whoopee they're not that
easy<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.530> find<00:03:41.770> anywhere<00:03:42.250> in<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.520> game<00:03:42.730> that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
easy to find anywhere in this game that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.120 
easy to find anywhere in this game that
easy<00:03:43.660> anyway<00:03:43.900> they<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:44.080> randomly<00:03:44.620> appear<00:03:44.980> at

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
easy anyway they just randomly appear at

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.520 
easy anyway they just randomly appear at
times<00:03:45.460> but<00:03:46.270> maybe<00:03:46.510> I've<00:03:46.810> only<00:03:46.990> seen<00:03:47.320> maybe

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
times but maybe I've only seen maybe

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.310 
times but maybe I've only seen maybe
like<00:03:47.800> maybe<00:03:48.730> four<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.480> them<00:03:49.750> my<00:03:49.930> whole<00:03:50.110> time

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
like maybe four of them my whole time

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.930 
like maybe four of them my whole time
they<00:03:50.500> were<00:03:50.530> playing<00:03:50.860> Grand<00:03:51.610> Theft<00:03:51.670> Auto

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
this part of Portland or whatever but uh

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.990 
this part of Portland or whatever but uh

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
he's going to start an island they'll

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.670 
he's going to start an island they'll
fit<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.540> one<00:04:16.780> most<00:04:16.989> definitely<00:04:17.440> shorts

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
fit in that one most definitely shorts

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.200 
fit in that one most definitely shorts
ideal<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.160> if<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.400> do<00:04:18.549> accidentally<00:04:19.000> do<00:04:19.120> the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
ideal but if you do accidentally do the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.740 
ideal but if you do accidentally do the
missions<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.870> can<00:04:20.049> always<00:04:20.620> redo<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
missions and you can always redo the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.700 
missions and you can always redo the
missions<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.870> guess<00:04:23.050> they<00:04:23.200> always<00:04:23.440> let<00:04:23.620> them

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
missions I guess they always let them

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.320 
missions I guess they always let them
play<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.190> replay<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> missions<00:04:25.030> for<00:04:25.150> some

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
play you replay the missions for some

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.730 
play you replay the missions for some
reason<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.630> don't<00:04:25.720> know<00:04:25.870> why<00:04:26.050> they<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.560> but

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
