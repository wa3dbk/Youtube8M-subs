00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello very good everyone was with echo and 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.649
 welcome to a new episode of the 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.690
 weapons guide and in this case I'm going to 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.590
 analyze and I will give some advice on 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.019
 the salt in English or the ape in Spanish 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.189
 I hope it 's magicians like they do not call 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.020
 Well, I do not care about everyone. 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.610
 called machine gun I would say even I 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.470
 also so we're going to call it the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.180
 light machine gun and out we did not either 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.370
 let's complicate life 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.590
 and good to start this weapon is a 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.000
 weapon that you take it from the supplies not 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.220
 it's a main weapon that you do not have no 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.390
 you can have this from the beginning 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.770
 arm as I said of the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.500
 supplies in types of game where 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.510
 there are supplies shipping supplies or 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.340
 because it is on the map that appears like this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.160
 to the randomly in other types of 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.980
 departure and good external is pretty 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.750
 good and not in the game modes 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.250
 of supplies usually serve one of the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.920
 first if it does not come out this one will come out 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.019
 Shotgun then 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.300
 It is very advisable I advise you 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.089
 very much that you take this weapon because it is 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.090
 very very good and good as you are seeing 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.370
 in these in these gameplays 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.530
 I use this weapon in two ways and 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.960
 I think a lot of people do not know this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.050
 this way but well I will explain step 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.280
 step by step then this weapon as it is a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.600
 light machine gun and as in all 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 games has a charger that is very 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.570
 wide so do not worry about the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 ammunition you will not be left without 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.560
 ammunition unless you waste 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.869
 you waste bullets as if you do not 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.670
 There would be tomorrow so you will leave us 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.200
 without ammunition and the charger is not going to 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.700
 end in the middle of the battle because it is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.400
 very big and it will give you plenty to 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.560
 kill one then is machine gun 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.240
 is very good very very good short 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.100
 reach because if it shoots it's automatic 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.740
 you kill the enemy very fast 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.270
 then it is even better than a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.460
 shotgun and I the pressure before a 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.259
 shotgun because this weapon comfortable and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.720
 I will explain a little bit later gives us 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.570
 a medium-range option that already 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.590
 I'll see it now but good is that short 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.670
 reach as you are seeing our 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.369
 example and that surely you will have seen 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.289
 the other shooting mode but good to 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.030
 short range of automatic shooting is 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.470
 and do not shoot until you PARAIS 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.880
 the enemy dies and do not worry 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.430
 because with its damage that is quite 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.009
 quite high the damage that does so what 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.240
 you're going to kill very, very fast and we're going to 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.250
 you will win almost always short 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.880
 scope 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 and then as I explained before as 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.350
 I said before this this weapon has a 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.050
 shooting mode good mode you can 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.850
 shoot otherwise it's bursts and 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.100
 that is a way that I love to me 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.260
 I like it very much and I use it whenever 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.730
 I can with this machine gun that although 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.290
 It seems that the machine gun is short 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.820
 reach and many people just use it 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.459
 short range because it says for is a 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.320
 machine gun I shot followed like this without 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.480
 stop until more of the enemy and up 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.290
 I can not reach it because I can not 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.630
 bullets do not arrive but good this weapon 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.580
 if you use it is like in these gameplays 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 that you are looking in the background if you use 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.060
 to bursts but very short bursts and very 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 very repeated because you can do a lot 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
 damage and bullets do not worry that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.660
 they will reach the enemy sure that this 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 gun by the way the crosshead 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.410
 the same thing happens to him as the rifles of 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.180
 assault that when you shoot followed by 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.640
 crosshead is increased then if you shoot 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.230
 very often the focus is going to 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.180
 increase so you're going to lose precision 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.600
 of the bullets the bullets are going to spread 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.150
 plus 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.160
 greater greater leisure well by 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 call it somehow I do not get it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.090
 now in the word then short 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.920
 reach does not matter because the body 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.450
 occupies almost the entire screen of the enemy 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.390
 because it is very close but long 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.950
 reach where you can compete against 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.349
 rifles like the dmr or the battle rifle 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.709
 is this machine gun and shoot at 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.790
 short or with short bursts very 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.379
 controlled and very fast that the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660
 problem of that the only problem that you 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.060
 this nonsense is that you need to 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.500
 shoot so you need a pretty finger 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.599
 quick to have a pretty trigger 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.160
 fast but good if more is a little 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.500
 Get used to it and that's it 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.660
 you're used is easy to use it's very 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.069
 easy and it is already has no other 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.069
 Complication in short-range maps 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.450
 It is very advisable and I take it bone and 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.890
 I prefer it very much before a 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.870
 shotgun or always whenever I can 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.370
 I'm lame this is a trainer because that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.290
 it is short-range 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.019
 dies in safe and at long range I can 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.209
 compete against a rifle and shot at 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.040
 short and controlled bursts and very 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.799
 fast is ta ta ta ta as if 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.389
 it was an automatic but without being 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 all automatic then the precision goes 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.130
 to be perfect and you will be able to compete 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.350
 even with rifles like the rifle 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.330
 battle and so because the enemies are 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.550
 often get nervous then it 's a 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.610
 pretty easy to use weapon and one of 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.500
 the best and highly recommended and nothing 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.430
 until it came the video already cortito 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.110
 I know there's not much 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.110
 so nothing until the next video
