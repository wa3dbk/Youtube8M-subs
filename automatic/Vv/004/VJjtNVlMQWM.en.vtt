the<00:00:00.390> magic<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:00.900> clears<00:00:01.410> out<00:00:01.589> filled<00:00:01.949> again

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
the magic video clears out filled again

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.550 
the magic video clears out filled again
so<00:00:03.030> we<00:00:03.179> can<00:00:03.210> actually<00:00:03.449> have<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.840> go<00:00:03.990> at<00:00:04.140> one

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so we can actually have a go at one

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.490 
so we can actually have a go at one
that's<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.920> little<00:00:05.160> bit<00:00:05.400> more<00:00:06.180> challenging<00:00:06.899> I'm

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
that's a little bit more challenging I'm

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.299 
that's a little bit more challenging I'm
gonna<00:00:07.770> put<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.189> six<00:00:08.660> I'm<00:00:09.660> gonna<00:00:09.990> put<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> four<00:00:10.860> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
gonna put a six I'm gonna put a four and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.039 
gonna put a six I'm gonna put a four and
I'm<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> put<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.170> nice<00:00:13.650> low<00:00:13.980> number<00:00:15.049> three

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I'm going to put a nice low number three

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.710 
I'm going to put a nice low number three
six<00:00:16.800> four<00:00:17.039> three

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
six four three

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.019 
six four three
so<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.869> 6<00:00:19.109> 4<00:00:19.289> 3<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.740> number<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.070> 643<00:00:23.029> 643

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so what 6 4 3 what number is 643 643

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
so what 6 4 3 what number is 643 643
very<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.769> gonna<00:00:25.830> take<00:00:26.250> away<00:00:28.279> hmm

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
very good and we're gonna take away hmm

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.170 
very good and we're gonna take away hmm
let's<00:00:29.730> make<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.939> reasonably<00:00:30.539> big<00:00:34.280> 168<00:00:38.000> 643

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
let's make it reasonably big 168 643

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
let's make it reasonably big 168 643
-<00:00:39.860> 168<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.190> look<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.850> know

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
- 168 now you look at that and you know

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
- 168 now you look at that and you know
you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.989> done<00:00:43.110> because

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you can do it it can be done because

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.270 
you can do it it can be done because
it's<00:00:43.980> obvious<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.480> 168<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> way<00:00:45.840> less<00:00:46.050> than

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's obvious that 168 is way less than

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
it's obvious that 168 is way less than
643<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.210> help<00:00:48.420> us<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> help<00:00:49.260> us

643 to help us do this and to help us
understand<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.219> works<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:50.879> going

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
understand how that it works we're going

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990 
understand how that it works we're going
to<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.649> gonna<00:00:52.770> make<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.969> so

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
to make it so I'm gonna make it right so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
to make it so I'm gonna make it right so
now<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:54.809> hundreds<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.500> need<00:00:55.680> 6<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
now I use these hundreds I need 6 of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
now I use these hundreds I need 6 of
them<00:00:56.190> 1<00:00:56.840> 2<00:00:57.840> 3<00:00:58.739> 4<00:00:59.640> 5<00:01:00.570> 6

there's<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.670> six<00:01:03.000> hundreds<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.739> move<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
there's my six hundreds I just move the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
there's my six hundreds I just move the
whole<00:01:05.129> lockdown<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
whole lockdown of it so you can see it a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.130 
whole lockdown of it so you can see it a
bit<00:01:06.630> better

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
bit better

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
bit better
there's<00:01:07.530> my<00:01:07.680> six<00:01:07.979> hundreds<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> need<00:01:09.150> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
there's my six hundreds now I need for

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.670 
there's my six hundreds now I need for
tens<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:10.409> 40<00:01:11.960> there<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.110> four<00:01:13.380> tens

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
tens to make 40 there are my four tens

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.310 
tens to make 40 there are my four tens
and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.580> three<00:01:14.909> ones<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.460> three

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
and I need my three ones to make three

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
and I need my three ones to make three
I'm<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.159> these<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.820> place

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I'm going to put these into a place

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.499 
I'm going to put these into a place
value<00:01:21.659> chart<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:23.030> I'm<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.150> line

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
value chart now I'm gonna line

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190 
value chart now I'm gonna line
everything<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.470> neatly<00:01:26.689> it's<00:01:27.689> very

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
everything up really neatly it's very

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.490 
everything up really neatly it's very
important<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.400> neat<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.030> maths<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:31.079> these

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
important to be neat in maths all these

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
important to be neat in maths all these
columns<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> line<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:32.880> otherwise<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
columns have to line up otherwise it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
columns have to line up otherwise it
becomes<00:01:33.900> very<00:01:34.409> challenging<00:01:34.530> later<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> I'm

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
becomes very challenging later on so I'm

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
becomes very challenging later on so I'm
going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> convert<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.619> place<00:01:37.890> value

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
going to convert this into a place value

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.060 
going to convert this into a place value
chart<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
chart now like this

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
chart now like this
there's<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.369> place<00:01:41.670> value<00:01:42.030> chart<00:01:42.110> here<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.200> my

them<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.430> started<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
them up now so we can get started I

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.240 
them up now so we can get started I
don't<00:02:58.230> know<00:02:58.290> how<00:02:58.410> far<00:02:58.650> we're<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.100> get

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
don't know how far we're going to get

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.660 
don't know how far we're going to get
but<00:02:59.490> let's<00:02:59.700> get<00:02:59.880> going<00:03:01.130> we<00:03:02.130> don't<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.370> three

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
but let's get going we don't have three

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.000 
but let's get going we don't have three
here<00:03:03.030> anymore<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.810> moved<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.470> ten<00:03:04.830> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
here anymore because I moved that ten in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130 
here anymore because I moved that ten in
there<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.850> three<00:03:06.150> plus<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> ten<00:03:06.900> though<00:03:07.110> I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
there so three plus the ten though I

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.630 
there so three plus the ten though I
borrowed<00:03:07.590> makes<00:03:08.250> 13<00:03:08.940> 13<00:03:09.570> take<00:03:09.840> away<00:03:10.050> eight<00:03:10.290> I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
borrowed makes 13 13 take away eight I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.480 
borrowed makes 13 13 take away eight I
can<00:03:11.640> do<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:13.230> two<00:03:13.470> three<00:03:13.770> left<00:03:13.950> over<00:03:14.280> here

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
can do that one two three left over here

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.270 
can do that one two three left over here
so<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.240> don't<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.570> four<00:03:15.810> anymore<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.500> only<00:03:17.130> got

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so I don't have four anymore I only got

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.160 
so I don't have four anymore I only got
three<00:03:17.640> I'm<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> cross<00:03:18.360> off<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.750> before

three I'm going to cross off that before

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.230 
three I'm going to cross off that before
and<00:03:19.980> I'm<00:03:20.070> gonna<00:03:20.160> put<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.580> three<00:03:21.000> there

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
and I'm gonna put this three there

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.450 
and I'm gonna put this three there
because<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.570> don't<00:03:21.630> have<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.050> anymore

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
because I don't have it anymore

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.040

now I'm going to do the 13 take away
eight<00:03:25.170> I'm<00:03:25.290> gonna<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.740> unit's<00:03:26.100> first<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
eight I'm gonna do the unit's first to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.550

it's wrong you have to follow the force
of<00:04:03.540> gravity<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:03.990> have<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.260> go<00:04:04.350> down<00:04:04.709> otherwise

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
of gravity we have to go down otherwise

of gravity we have to go down otherwise
so<00:04:05.760> Isaac<00:04:05.970> Newton<00:04:06.420> freaks<00:04:06.720> out<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:07.380> won't

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
so Isaac Newton freaks out so we won't

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.580
