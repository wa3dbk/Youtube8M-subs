work better in holding the color and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720 
work better in holding the color and
bringing<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> color<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.199> stronger<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.520> my

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
bringing the color out stronger on my

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
bringing the color out stronger on my
complexion<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:00.690> why<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> two

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
complexion so that's why I got the two

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.729 
complexion so that's why I got the two
now<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> huge<00:01:02.640> range<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> NYX<00:01:04.049> mega

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
now there's a huge range of the NYX mega

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
now there's a huge range of the NYX mega
shine<00:01:05.040> lip<00:01:05.400> glosses<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.780> hard

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
shine lip glosses and it was really hard

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
shine lip glosses and it was really hard
for<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.409> pick<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> color<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for me to pick a color because they just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.660 
for me to pick a color because they just
basically<00:01:09.330> had<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> lip<00:01:10.650> gloss<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.460> name

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
basically had the lip gloss and the name

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060 
basically had the lip gloss and the name
underneath<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.110> went<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.590> youtube

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
underneath so I actually went on youtube

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
underneath so I actually went on youtube
and<00:01:14.310> watch<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.760> couple<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> reviews<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.750> see

skinned girls and I kind of went off

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
skinned girls and I kind of went off
that<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> end<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.650> chose<00:01:22.680> tea<00:01:23.310> rose

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.630 
that but in the end I chose tea rose
which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.330> pink<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.640> Miami

babe<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> natural

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
babe which is this kind of natural

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
babe which is this kind of natural
colored<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.990> I've<00:01:31.079> tried<00:01:31.320> them

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
colored one here now I've tried them

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
colored one here now I've tried them
both<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> found<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
both on and I found that this one

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.539 
both on and I found that this one
actually<00:01:33.450> comes<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> clear<00:01:35.340> lip

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
actually comes out more as a clear lip

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
actually comes out more as a clear lip
gloss<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.090> it'll<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.540> good<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.170> over<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gloss so it'll be good to put over a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.760 
gloss so it'll be good to put over a
color<00:01:38.100> maybe<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> pink<00:01:39.659> lipstick<00:01:40.200> but

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
color maybe like a pink lipstick but

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100 
color maybe like a pink lipstick but
this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:42.030> nice<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this one was really really nice I'm it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.740 
this one was really really nice I'm it
came<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:44.220> nice<00:01:44.460> natural<00:01:45.329> mood

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
came out as a really nice natural mood
