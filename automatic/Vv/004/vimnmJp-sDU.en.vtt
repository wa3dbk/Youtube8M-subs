00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.009
 let's prepare aubergines stuffed with 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.860
 minced meat for this we will need 2 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.070
 large aubergines a chopped carrot 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.860
 a chopped onion 400 grams of meat 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.140
 chopped to taste 200 milliliters of tomato 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.519
 fried and 200 milliliters of cream for 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.369
 Cook 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:27.310
 we start cutting the tip to the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.310
 Eggplants and splitting them in half 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.930
 with a small knife we ​​will cut through 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.990
 the edges 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.990
 and we will lower the eggplant horizontally 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.500
 you have to be careful not to break the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.500
 skin 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.600
 we lower it cross 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 and sprinkle it with salt 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.180
 and we take a splash of oil 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.000
 We do the same with all 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.770
 eggplant and put them on a plate 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.770
 of oven or yanga 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.110
 we have to put 200 in the oven 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.110
 degrees around half an hour 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:34.090
 meanwhile in a frying pan we throw a 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.090
 trickle of oil and press the onion 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.130
 we also add the carrot since 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.869
 it's done more or less at the same time 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.869
 we put a little salt 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.280
 and sauté over medium heat 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.810
 we have to keep on watching 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.550
 our aubergines that when they are 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.550
 ready we will take out of the oven 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.990
 Be careful not to get burned 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.510
 all the meat to our eggplants 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.780
 you have to be careful not to split them 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.780
 skin 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.540
 we will reserve the meat of 2 half of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.540
 eggplant 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.300
 and we will accommodate them again in our 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.300
 furnace rim 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.090
 we pricked the meat that we have removed 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.990
 and we reheat our sauce 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.990
 to add the eggplant meat 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.840
 also add minced meat 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.490
 which can be beef or pork 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.490
 mixed what we like 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.560
 we season a little 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.460
 and the fry them well for the filling 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.120
 when you have lost the pink color and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 white and add the fried tomato 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.560
 we move well 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.690
 and then we will also add the cream 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.760
 to us in the preparations with cream 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.680
 we always like to take a little 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.300
 nutmeg although we have not said 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.300
 at the beginning the ingredients 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.200
 as soon as I have expressed a bit the 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.200
 we will remove from the fire 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.220
 we did not get the aubergines placed in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.610
 the tire as much as we can 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.350
 the more stuffed the richer they install 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.889
 although probably not over a little 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.220
 that we can use as stuffing of what 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.220
 we want 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.540
 or even to make buns or pizzas 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.850
 when we have them well filled 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.850
 sprinkle the generous Parmesan 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.710
 and we take them to gratin in the oven until 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.710
 cristian doraditas 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.770
 once the cheese has melted and browned 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.770
 will be ready to serve 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.480
 they look great
