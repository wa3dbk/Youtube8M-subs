 jaguar and software for architects 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.359
 the computer is divided into two software parts said jaua 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.260
 hardware corresponds to all the physical and tangible parts of a computer 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.720
 its electromechanical electronic electrical components and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.429
 mechanics 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.849
 the jaguar is divided 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.279
 three basic components 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.890
 central processing unit peru 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 ram memory 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.940
 input peripherals 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 peripheral peripheral storage peripherals 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.880
 the fete of ugt 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.030
 is the fundamental component of the computer responsible for interpreting and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 execute instructions both process data 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.420
 ram is the acronym for random access memory a type of computer memory a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.490
 which can be accessed randomly ie you can access any 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.070
 oscillating memory without accessing the present countries the ram is the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.600
 most common type of memory 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.000
 there are two basic types of ram 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 dynamic ram plan 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 Ramesh Ramon traffickers 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.590
 the two types of RAM differ in the technology that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.560
 they use to save the data the dynamic ram is the most common 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.570
 dynamic ram needs to be updated thousands of times per second 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.370
 and static RAM does not need to be updated which is faster 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.010
 although also more expensive 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.810
 both types of ram lose their content to pay for their equipment 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.800
 memory rom read-only memories normally known by its acronym 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.930
 real where memory is a class of storage media used in the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
 computers and other electronic devices 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.250
 peripherals are the units or devices through which a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.090
 computer communicates with the outside world as well as the systems that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.040
 store or archive the information serving as auxiliary memory of the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.360
 principal memory 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.480
 input peripherals are those that allow entering external data to the 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.780
 computer for further treatment by the US Fed 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.779
 the most common input peripherals are 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.029
 the keyboard mabus webcam web microphone and so on 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.129
 Outbound peripherals are those that receive information that is processed 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.879
 By the US Fed Monitor 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.089
 printer speaker and so on 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.050
 peripheral input or output 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.240
 are the components of the computer that allow us to enter and receive 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.279
 information 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.279
 memory we serve cd printers 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.189
 storage peripherals are responsible for saving the data of those who 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.459
 makes use of them once they have been removed from main memory and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 that it will be erased each time the computer is turned off 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.090
 sos strength 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.090
 is the set of computer programs procedures rules 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.450
 documentation and associated data that are part of the operations of a 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.309
 combos system 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.710
 the software is divided into two parts 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.149
 the basic software 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.339
 they are out of application 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.759
 it was only empty its goal is to properly unlink the user and 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.659
 the programmer of the details of the particular computer that you use there is 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.629
 commanded not specifically the processing referred to the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.140
 internal memory characteristics 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.609
 disk and so on 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.119
 includes among others 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:30.069
 operating systems device drivers utilities servers 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.279
 etc 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.749
 an operating system is a system software that is a set of 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.650
 computer programs aimed at many tasks, among which the 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.909
 effective resource management 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.309
 a mobile device driver is a computer program that allows 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:52.139
 the operating system interact with a peripheral doing an extraction of the 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.139
 carbon and providing an interface to use it 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.529
 only out of application 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.449
 that which allows users to carry out one or several specific tasks 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:06.090
 in any field of activity capable of being automated assisted 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.979
 with special emphasis on business 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.999
 as an example of application software you will find microsoft word microsoft 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.449
 excel microsoft paul by inc and peÃ±a 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.190
 microsoft word is a software for word processing 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.350
 It was created by the Microsoft company and is currently integrated into the suite 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.330
 office microsoft office 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 Microsoft Office Excel better known as Microsoft Excel is an application 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.199
 to handle spreadsheets this was and is still being developed and 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.940
 distributed by corn with the suns 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.260
 and is normally used in financial and accounting tasks 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.620
 microsoft powerpoint 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.870
 is a presentation program developed for operating systems 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.789
 microsoft windows and mac os 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.050
 widely used in various fields such as teaching and business 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.099
 etc 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.499
 microsoft points whose original name is intruder pa was developed in the year 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:08.199
 1982 by the newly created microsoft windows from version 1 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.979
 being a basic program 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.999
 this has been a brief summary what is your definition of your strong 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.990
 will keep the Veracruz University work designed for the subject of 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.349
 basic computation carried out by the engineer daniel filmus returned in the 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.139
