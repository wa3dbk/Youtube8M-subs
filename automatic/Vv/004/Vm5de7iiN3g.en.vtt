right over here yeah and most scooters
you<00:00:51.100> have<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.460> make<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.790> emitter<00:00:52.080> first<00:00:53.080> and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
you have to make the emitter first and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.750 
you have to make the emitter first and
then<00:00:53.500> put<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.890> which<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.310> hassle<00:00:54.700> because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
then put it in which is a hassle because

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.400 
then put it in which is a hassle because
then<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.060> can't<00:00:55.270> just<00:00:55.480> fill<00:00:55.630> up<00:00:55.750> at<00:00:55.870> ordinary

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
then you can't just fill up at ordinary

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.910 
then you can't just fill up at ordinary

yes<00:01:11.829> I<00:01:12.100> know<00:01:12.880> there's<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.390> Honda<00:01:13.900> Daioh

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
yes I know there's the Honda Daioh

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.590 
yes I know there's the Honda Daioh
which<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:15.369> can<00:01:15.520> also<00:01:15.670> do<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.000> but<00:01:16.300> they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
which you can also do that but they

Memphis but whatever there's a screw
here<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:25.900> there's<00:01:26.230> like<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> little<00:01:26.580> piece

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
here and there's like a little piece

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.520 
here and there's like a little piece
there<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:27.970> can<00:01:28.120> just<00:01:28.330> hook<00:01:28.570> your<00:01:29.200> helmet<00:01:29.470> on

in here and it's like secured got the
engine<00:01:36.010> it's<00:01:36.700> got<00:01:37.440> disc<00:01:38.440> brakes<00:01:39.180> hydraulic

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
engine it's got disc brakes hydraulic

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.870 
engine it's got disc brakes hydraulic
disc<00:01:40.360> brakes<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.810> front<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:42.400> back<00:01:42.430> it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
disc brakes on the front and the back it

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
disc brakes on the front and the back it
has<00:01:43.120> drum<00:01:43.510> brakes<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:50.560> got<00:01:50.799> big<00:01:51.340> fat<00:01:51.640> tires

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.399 
has drum brakes it's got big fat tires
um<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:54.820> like<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.630> was<00:01:55.960> comparing<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.380> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
um so it's like I was comparing it to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.039 
um so it's like I was comparing it to
the<00:01:56.590> diode<00:01:57.100> before<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.210> diode<00:01:58.510> has<00:01:58.690> really

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
the diode before the diode has really

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.789 
the diode before the diode has really
skinny<00:01:59.350> tires<00:01:59.560> like<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.909> big<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:02.170> thing<00:02:02.229> I

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
skinny tires like this big this thing I

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.830 
skinny tires like this big this thing I
mean<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.670> do<00:02:03.729> off-roading<00:02:04.270> with<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.630> I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
mean I do off-roading with it I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.210 
mean I do off-roading with it I
shouldn't<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:06.510> it's<00:02:07.510> got<00:02:07.659> big<00:02:07.840> thick<00:02:08.049> tires

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
shouldn't but it's got big thick tires

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760 
shouldn't but it's got big thick tires
it's<00:02:09.670> got<00:02:09.850> two<00:02:10.360> lights<00:02:10.900> people<00:02:11.380> always<00:02:11.500> say

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's got two lights people always say

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.080 
it's got two lights people always say
one<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.160> them's<00:02:12.310> burnt<00:02:12.550> out<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:12.940> it's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
one of them's burnt out but it's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.500 
one of them's burnt out but it's
actually<00:02:13.420> high<00:02:14.110> beam<00:02:14.350> low<00:02:14.680> beam<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
actually high beam low beam so here you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.120 
actually high beam low beam so here you
got<00:02:16.690> your<00:02:17.220> low<00:02:18.220> beam<00:02:18.490> right<00:02:19.330> there<00:02:19.360> high<00:02:19.870> beam

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
got your low beam right there high beam

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.280 
got your low beam right there high beam
turn<00:02:21.130> signals<00:02:21.660> press<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.080> would<00:02:23.170> be

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
click silver right pretty cool so that's

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.410 
click silver right pretty cool so that's
a<00:03:41.490> turn<00:03:41.700> signals<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.630> both<00:03:42.750> sides
