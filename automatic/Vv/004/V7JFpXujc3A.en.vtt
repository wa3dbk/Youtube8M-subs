00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 my review of the g 600 mmo gaming mouse 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 from the house logitech the name says 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 already what program is this mouse 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.189
 a mmo gaming mouse which is what you get from it 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 realize that the total of 20 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 Programmable keys at save twelve 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.019
 there are thumbs here and are here 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 beautifully lit on the side of the thumb 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.250
 usually also when gaming 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.070
 is for processing is to say 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 top processing so there speaks synonymous 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 for the longevity of the logitech 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.789
 gaming mice the mouse has really top 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.289
 gap measures the council has nothing there 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.989
 it does not squeak when you see the mouse 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.120
 you do not hear anything against one 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:58.140
 so great workmanship would speak 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.500
 the quality is really bomb then the dpi 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.570
 The mouse has a night 1200 dpi 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 sensor down here 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 that does not mean much at first though 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 Of course you can do the software a lot 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.189
 So you can do it in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.659
 to adjust to many different levels 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.090
 which is of course an advantage 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.650
 in my view, the key is the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.820
 Mouse is really very pleasant 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.400
 I just have to watch where I am 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.950
 so clique here so it really is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.799
 You can not fault it optimally 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.060
 the tracking is also acceptable so 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.689
 no particular abnormalities when 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.880
 fracking 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.299
 the equipment is of course if we are 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.950
 Watching new items, what all this was 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.920
 I mean mainly with equipment 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.689
 but the software because the software is 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.470
 of course, one of the one 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.509
 Hitchhikes of architect great 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.820
 accessories are not there so much 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.079
 but of course you get many 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.719
 features included here of course the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.770
 Lighting the individual lighting 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.869
 that the third mouse button is all possible 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 the software is still in the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.750
 foreground because that's pretty easy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.200
 good then we have as more 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.420
 of course, the orientation on 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.519
 the buttons on the side to the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.709
 thumb buttons that are in two 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.110
 divided sixpacks I do not know if 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.910
 you can recognize that now 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.190
 but here we have the right keys six 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.420
 and alarms left number six buttons in 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.340
 the middle of it is a kind of furrow 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.269
 You can be quite good at it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.010
 orient without looking at it naturally 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.930
 then as said, this mouse is durable 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.730
 he thinks it ran the cable to so 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.819
 braided the cable with fabric outside 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.380
 which, of course, this gyro factor 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.120
 minimized first and secondly 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.150
 of course, the resistance 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 of the cable as I said gap measurements and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.799
 Squeak is also top individual 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.989
 Illuminator I have this here now 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.970
 this vibrant selected in red 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.630
 but you can of course also many 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.819
 more different types of lighting 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.349
 then select the three mouse buttons 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.900
 I work amazingly well too 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.610
 had thought at the beginning since you get used to 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.910
 never turn it on 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.290
 but that comes with the time I find there 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.910
 you just get used to it and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.569
 then use the third mouse button 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.269
 as if she had always been there 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.790
 So, to say about ergonomics first 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.530
 have time to slip resistance up here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.790
 we have a non-slip surface and here 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.720
 At the side we have one more 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.660
 gummed surface of course to grip 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.700
 So contribute so much from the 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.440
 hand slip or filing will ye 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.600
 Do not you that 's already lying 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.590
 very good in the hand 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.069
 but since I'm now the same again 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.780
 to talk about it in terms of weight 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.340
 commercial contra arguments is the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.200
 Do not get that far ahead of you 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.109
 she is not really that hard 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.599
 but she's not really 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.030
 easy off so that can be as a plus point 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.530
 you do not value the weight 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.609
 I find it a bit harder than 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.920
 When I liked it then the keys are 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.690
 partly not so good to reach 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.819
 I have relatively big hands that plays 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.620
 back in the cards but someone who 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.269
 smaller one has towards reaching here this 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.789
 g keys, for example, very difficult 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.590
 those in the middle are good for 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.530
 the gaming use not thought 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.090
 but rather to the dpi number too 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.660
 prevent but they are too 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.820
 during the game if you like that hand 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:35.550
 has bad reach then of course 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.770
 dpi of 8,200 offers that honestly 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.220
 no value people so you will 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.360
 never come into the situation that you 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.250
 few of you will be in the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.530
 situation come that you 8200 bp 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.330
 needs then we are already at 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.920
 a bit longer time for the review for 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.810
 ego shooter, the mouse is hardly suitable 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.980
 because the ergonomics are easy to wish 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.920
 which is not left now 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.380
 especially bad but for example us 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.690
 just take the g700 to hand here 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.240
 which is just a lot better in 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.070
 the hand so that's already complete 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.570
 World comes with ego shooters 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.100
 really, the mouse on you 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.200
 good in hand, it is a certain 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.540
 comfort you have that you the 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.220
 control has very good and mmo 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.510
 mice is mainly a matter 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.010
 that you have many programmable buttons 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.060
 have around the different functions 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.200
 to be able to put on it 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.580
 So that already fulfills its purpose 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.290
 Of course she is not on it now 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.720
 designed to be as economical as possible 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.190
 but the main factor why you look 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.130
 those mouse buys are of course the ones 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.500
 many keys 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.880
 buy cost 75 euros cost the house 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.620
 is not very expensive but also 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.450
 not very cheap there are 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.350
 example still the razer mamba which has vp 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.830
 from 130 or 129 euro I believe that 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.690
 are just then again a few euros more 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.860
 but the mouse is really cheap now 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.990
 not no bargain 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.700
 but I know that if you do 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.770
 still want to buy mouse clicks 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.360
 the link in the description that would 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.860
 help me very much otherwise see us at 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.820
 next video people i hope i have 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.730
 I liked it 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.320
 if so please leave a like below or 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.590
 Write a comment if you have something 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.940
 We have to criticize ourselves 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.940
 next video people until then
