today<00:00:04.380> we<00:00:04.529> will<00:00:04.680> take<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.920> look<00:00:05.069> at<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.609> drug<00:00:05.910> test

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
today we will take a look at a drug test

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.400 
today we will take a look at a drug test
study<00:00:10.400> the<00:00:11.400> first<00:00:11.700> thing<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.750> create

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
study the first thing to do is to create

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.630 
study the first thing to do is to create
a<00:00:13.440> new<00:00:13.889> assimilation<00:00:14.730> study<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> drug<00:00:16.020> test

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
a new assimilation study as a drug test

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220 
a new assimilation study as a drug test
after<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.060> will<00:00:18.210> take<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> look<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.990> each

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
after this we will take a look on each

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.099 
after this we will take a look on each
part<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.279> sure<00:00:20.630> every<00:00:21.630> part<00:00:21.840> after

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
part to make sure every part after

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
part to make sure every part after
proper<00:00:23.039> material<00:00:24.050> 3d<00:00:25.050> mesh<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:27.029> will

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
proper material 3d mesh so we will

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.400 
proper material 3d mesh so we will
select<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.750> mesh<00:00:28.230> control<00:00:28.560> selector<00:00:29.340> proper

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
select a mesh control selector proper

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
select a mesh control selector proper
the<00:00:31.410> proper<00:00:31.830> part<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> apply<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.540> mesh<00:00:33.840> for

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the proper part and apply a mesh for

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.540 
the proper part and apply a mesh for
this<00:00:34.440> bar<00:00:34.710> after<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> would<00:00:36.030> create<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.719> new

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
this bar after this would create a new

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.590 
this bar after this would create a new
curvature<00:00:38.550> base<00:00:38.910> mesh<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:41.600> assembly

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
curvature base mesh for the all assembly

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.310 
curvature base mesh for the all assembly
and<00:00:42.809> select<00:00:43.680> giraffe<00:00:44.670> quality<00:00:45.360> mesh<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and select giraffe quality mesh just to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.240 
and select giraffe quality mesh just to
make<00:00:46.469> everything<00:00:46.649> faster<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
make everything faster we will go to the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.049 
make everything faster we will go to the
set<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.410> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> set<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.760> type
