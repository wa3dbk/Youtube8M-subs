00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.940
 then the ground bar brings to 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.660
 dancers a lot of things that allows 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.190
 to work 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.540
 obviously the technique and then 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.470
 stretching muscles stretching 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.869
 muscles 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.810
 we start relief with a relaxation 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.790
 and a gentle awakening of the body we 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.880
 let's go through a series of exercises 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.489
 who work on easing 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 stretching elongation placement 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.230
 and the fluidity of the body in motion 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 we will finish the court with a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.110
 internship 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 it is even if we are on the ground we have this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.090
 feeling is doing something 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.309
 beautiful while working his body 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 of course we will work on the in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 outside the lower legs and opening 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 placement of the basin withdraw parallel 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.790
 open outside close and reclining 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.790
 the same thing 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.040
 1 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.170
 thing with the two players over having 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.310
 worked I completely relaxed 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.210
 as we also work a lot with 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.670
 breathing 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 it allows a lot of relaxation 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.570
 body but also his mind 6 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.720
 we will work in the fourth 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.610
 sitting right leg in front of us 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 will work on the fluidity and the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.900
 upper body placement 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 with the lengthening and stretching of 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 hamstring hamstring unrolled from the column 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.650
 vertebral 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:41.830
 push the pelvis forward and there 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.600
 rest the pelvis on the sound 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.880
 with luce 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.780
 tomorrow 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 profile tour to lengthen the legs 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.950
 stretches hamstring hamstrings released 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.160
 round the column to the legs 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.750
 the music is already catchy and we have 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.190
 want to go a little too 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.040
 interpretation in modes in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.270
 emotion and dance it's not it's 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.470
 no bar on the ground is dance 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 for me 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.450
 we resume there 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.450

 well both shoulder blades on the front floor 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.470
 to raise arms to pass on the 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.810
 belly which necessarily while lying 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.570
 on the ground we can no longer work on 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.680
 the opening of the back and the fluidity 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.960
 movements we end help I 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
