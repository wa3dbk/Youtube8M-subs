00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.029

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.910
 I direct hospitals is not for both 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.180
 beds per room without exceptions 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.130
 once a thousand survey was done 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.199
 people were asked if they would like 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.570
 know the exact day they were going to 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.190
 die who with that spirit who with 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.650
 93 96 percent said no eye 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.200
 where I am in the morgue and that was the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.970
 first time I saw eduard coll I want to 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.220
 a room for directed hospitals 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.020
 not those two beds per room without 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.670
 exceptions that kill me seven passed 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.880
 the next three weeks next to the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.070
 found pour my philosophy professor of 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.500
 first he told us to make a 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.780
 list of all the things that we 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.859
 You like to do in life before 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.699
 kick the bucket 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:59.269
 it does not make sense we could do it 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.269
 We should do it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.640
 is pulled from the mind to lead it to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.620
 marry them we are knowing 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
 and I get it in mind how can you 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.240
 get away with someone you do not know 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.790
 vo 45 years gutting cars I deserve 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.010
 releasing the handbrake have children ? 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.550
 I know nothing about it because it is high time that 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.550
 supposed 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.120
 what scares you so much the fact that you 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 have told my life does not mean that 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.500
 part of her 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.680
 dear eduardo I will never be able to pay you everything 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 what you have done for me 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.180
 so instead of trying, I'm going to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 tell you to do me another favor 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.439
 you find joy in your day 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.439
 You hate me 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 we live we die and the wheel keeps turning 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 and turning 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.320
 I'm proud of you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.320
 I really do not give a fuck
