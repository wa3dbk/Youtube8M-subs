00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.150
 ah 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.900
 today we are going to look at how the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.670
 magic squares in this case squares 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.880
 magical with unit units per side 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.100
 odd 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.190
 for example a square of three by three 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.019
 of a square of five by five 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.460
 for this is going to create the following 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.219
 formula the sum of all the parades and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.070
 the columns of the square are with 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.829
 this formula number of units per side 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.219
 to the 3 most number of video units 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.640
 between 2 we go in the first example in a 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.600
 square 3 x 3 let's see how much should 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.890
 add each of their ranks and their 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.630
 columns just like it's diagonal 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 then we have in the a 3 in this case 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 Stress 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.270
 more efe 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.579
 which is 3 divided by 2 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 then the sum in this square must 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:35.440
 be person 327 plus 330 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.260
 30 between 2 equal to whoever 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.020
 very well now how are the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.250
 numbers we should always start with the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.880
 top drawer in the center 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.880
 that is, we place the number 1 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.180
 then at the opposite end a camera to 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.180
 the right the two 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.240
 all numbers want to follow this 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.320
 diagonal but as here there is not a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 box then we go to the opposite side 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.709
 I would follow 3 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.630
 wants to follow this diagonal but as 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:25.990
 it's busy we went below then 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:29.110
 4 we continue with diagonal 5 diagonal 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.460
 in this case it would continue out but 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.240
 as there is no then under 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.890
 7 we continue with the diagonal 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.280
 as there is no box then they pass to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.680
 front 8 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 We continue with the diagonal but as not 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.460
 there is box then to the opposite side 9 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.370
 we are going to realize that always the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.220
 first number is at the center in the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.890
 top and the last number is 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:05.520
 in the center at the bottom if 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:11.380
 we checked 4 913 plus 2 15 6 7 13 + 2 15 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:14.170
 38 15 15 here 15 here 15 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.160
 everywhere now we go with this 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.920
 magic square of 5 x 5 we use the 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.960
 formula for the sum to establish 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.480
 what should be the sum of their rows and 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:31.680
 columns n in this case is 5 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.519
 raised to the cube plus n 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.640
 divided between two we have then that 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.750
 the sum is equal to 5 cube which is 125 5 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.810
 130 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.959
 divided by 2 we get 65 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.200
 that is the amount that should add the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 magic square on all sides 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.150
 now we proceed to locate the numbers 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.760
 remember that number one always goes 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.760
 in the top row in the center 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.830
 all numbers try to follow the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.380
 diagonal is to say the 1 wants to continue 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.180
 in the upper right but as 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.430
 we do not have a box and for 2 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.430
 then we go to the opposite side 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.569
 the 2 wants to continue with the diagonal 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.810
 3 we continue the diagonal upwards 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.920
 but since there is no box then 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.920
 we go to the opposite side 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.390
 4 diagonal 5 how is stern to the 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.920
 diagonal that follows the 5 we pass below 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.340
 of 5 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.230
 6 and we continue with diagonal 78 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.150
 we continue here but as there is no 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.270
 space for 9 we pass next 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.270
 opposite 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.389
 we will continue here but as there is no place 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.389
 for 10 we went to the opposite side 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.330
 the 11 would not take place then we passed 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.330
 under 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.510
 11 and we continue with diagonal 12 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.900
 13 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.860
 14 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.420
 fifteen 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.289
 we will continue on this side but as not 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.110
 there is below 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.400
 16 bonus there is no space then at 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.490
 other side 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.530
 17 as we have no box next 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.250
 opposite 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.520
 18 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.629
 19 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.569
 20 as it is busy for 21 we passed 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:54.000
 under 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.780
 21 diagonal 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.930
 22 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.640
 as there is no space we pass in front 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.790
 23 diagonal 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.560
 24 as there is no space we pass next 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.930
 opposite 25 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.510
 a way to verify if we did well 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.300
 the procedures is to look at the one 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.940
 is in the middle of the top and 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.280
 the last number is in the middle of the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.980
 bottom part let's check randomly 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:32.370
 any of the lines we are going to look to see 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:42.060
 if it is rows if we get 65 4 10 23 43 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:45.889
 65 and let's leave this time 8 22 42 63 65 the 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:52.490
 I invite you to try other squares 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:52.490
 7 x 7 9 x 9 to where they are capable
