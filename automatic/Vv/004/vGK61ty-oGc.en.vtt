00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so again and again with the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.680
 probably next year to me now 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910
 quite a few things can happen with the case 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.280
 estate again the map could in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 Lately a bit too often though 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.920
 so better maps as the rail of I 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.340
 I accept that 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.340
 I've heard one right 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:37.200
 I hate that when it's so ugly 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 Magath was good at running away 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.620
 behind me 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.520
 it was so clear that he was running too 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.730
 as clear as she is under command 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.730
 Well 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.910
 right, however, is not why he 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.710
 why does he get out of the aim that is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 such a that is there I am only too 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.699
 actually the only one that happens 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.040
 since we can not ten when he at 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.600
 Ground is on the ground and sometimes even 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.750
 just out there so to speak that 's how it is 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.260
 funny 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.460
 so he goes in fire rain and so to speak 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.460
 learning is already great 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.340
 i play the shit 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.040
 top is definitely an old case 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.190
 needs two shots two hardliners 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.940
 it always takes two shots and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.570
 he will definitely have eaten three 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.570
 this is required 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.290
 also god 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.050
 for lanxess you one 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.230
 it's so exciting 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:34.710
 na good god would now therefore 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:37.710
 probably not funny 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.710
 shower 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.400
 I was on it 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.470
 Thank God 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.880
 if he's smart as she would have the harrier 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 Well 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.370
 which actually needs two digits that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.520
 is really pretty but I am right now too 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.030
 not high, I think so 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.030
 cope with 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.790
 Here is always one 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.290
 pretty much so good we used that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 you have relatively many nico place 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.780
 okay but I do not even do it 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.270
 god is just missing me then too 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.270
 somehow 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.690
 tja 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.100
 hmm 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.370
 it is such a mischief that is 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.989
 really just a really great one 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.990
 That's why you lobby so you play 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:48.960
 happy with german frivole this is 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:51.500
 born that the pulled kinders i was 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.500
 it 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.129
 So you know you moved it out you 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.110
 little fun de always has this 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.509
 Ugly bongos in the tenth game 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.509
 bum around the world 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.569
 bad 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.980
 Now comes the knife master again 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980
 here 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.330
 actually I would have to listen but yes 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.710
 then his ugly we dazzle and 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.130
 thereby also nothing've got because that 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.970
 not so horny I'm really disappointed 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:47.920
 from this house system that is behind me 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.920
 and your last 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.889
 oh so right good 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.950
 yes good 30 8 rather modest but okay 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.170
 the weapon is now mine too 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:19.360
 I do not have to say that in a church 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:20.880
 - such a great lobby here yes I have 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.020
 the gameplay failed 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.660
 if you like it last one 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.870
 easier if not then let yours 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.500
 dislike the spectator now comes up 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.500
 soon
