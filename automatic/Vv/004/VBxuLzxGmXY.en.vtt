honestly think you play this hole so
the<00:00:05.850> second<00:00:06.359> generation<00:00:06.649> snapdragon

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the second generation snapdragon

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.420 
the second generation snapdragon
processor<00:00:10.099> matched<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.340> us<00:00:11.459> we<00:00:11.549> got<00:00:11.730> three

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.970

p hdmi-out actually three nights you I

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.589 
p hdmi-out actually three nights you I
can<00:00:23.619> show<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.830> that<00:00:23.949> again<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:27.449> can't<00:00:28.449> believe

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
can show you that again I can't believe

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.200 
can show you that again I can't believe
this<00:00:28.810> is<00:00:28.869> running<00:00:29.200> on<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.380> phone<00:00:29.759> well<00:00:30.759> that

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
this is running on the phone well that

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.830 
this is running on the phone well that
will<00:00:31.449> actually<00:00:31.630> power<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:33.000> monitor<00:00:34.000> outputs

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
will actually power the monitor outputs

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.630 
will actually power the monitor outputs
any<00:00:35.079> progressive<00:00:35.410> loss<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:36.220> know<00:00:36.340> what<00:00:36.489> kind

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
any progressive loss you know what kind

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.850 
any progressive loss you know what kind
of<00:00:36.670> like<00:00:36.910> frost<00:00:37.269> like<00:00:37.839> graphics<00:00:38.230> processor<00:00:38.710> is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
of like frost like graphics processor is

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.009 
of like frost like graphics processor is
using<00:00:39.280> charts<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:40.059> like<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> graphics<00:00:40.839> processor

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
using charts I like a graphics processor

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.330 
using charts I like a graphics processor
or<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.739> there's<00:00:41.949> none<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.640> does<00:00:43.120> have

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920 

so<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:49.149> isn't<00:00:49.420> part<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.579> ascetic<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:52.719> quite

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
so it isn't part of ascetic not quite

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.380 
so it isn't part of ascetic not quite
knowing<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:54.250> kind<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.460> video<00:00:54.699> file<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.149> it's

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
knowing what kind of video file is it's

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.350 
knowing what kind of video file is it's
just<00:00:55.480> like<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.809> MPEG<00:00:56.500> before

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
just like a MPEG before

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.430 
just like a MPEG before
the<00:00:58.870> Bravia<00:00:59.530> Engine<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.010> same<00:01:00.220> kind<00:01:00.460> of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the Bravia Engine is the same kind of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
the Bravia Engine is the same kind of
video<00:01:01.620> processing<00:01:01.980> engine<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> our

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
video processing engine we have in our

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
video processing engine we have in our
lobby<00:01:03.510> TV<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.830> scale<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
lobby TV this is a scale down for a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
lobby TV this is a scale down for a
mobile<00:01:05.670> device<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.690> that's<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
mobile device so that's how you get that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
mobile device so that's how you get that
depth<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:09.270> skin<00:01:09.840> tone<00:01:10.610> yeah<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
depth of you that skin tone yeah if you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
depth of you that skin tone yeah if you
have<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> higher<00:01:12.509> contrast<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> brush<00:01:14.460> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
have a higher contrast this brush this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.010 
have a higher contrast this brush this
is<00:01:15.509> amazing<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:17.149> might<00:01:18.149> end<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:18.420> switching<00:01:18.720> back

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is amazing I might end up switching back

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
is amazing I might end up switching back
yeah<00:01:19.850> we've<00:01:20.850> heard<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> than<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
I've always been a big fan of like Sony

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.890 
I've always been a big fan of like Sony
Ericsson's<00:01:43.300> hardware<00:01:43.890> design<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.630> their

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
Ericsson's hardware design that their

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.710 
Ericsson's hardware design that their
software<00:01:47.290> was<00:01:47.500> shitty<00:01:48.220> pull<00:01:48.670> especially<00:01:49.570> with

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
software was shitty pull especially with

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.649 
software was shitty pull especially with
the<00:01:49.950> first<00:01:50.950> kind<00:01:51.130> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the first kind of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.429 
the first kind of
first<00:01:52.649> kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> sick<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.119> into<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> the

first kind of sick go into the the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.389 
first kind of sick go into the the
android<00:01:55.859> market<00:01:56.249> with<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> x10<00:01:56.999> and<00:01:57.990> we

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
android market with the x10 and we

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.490 
android market with the x10 and we
honestly<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.729> didn't<00:01:59.939> assume<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
honestly we didn't assume that a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.360 
honestly we didn't assume that a
anticipate<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.650> we'd<00:02:03.800> be<00:02:03.920> changing

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
anticipate that we'd be changing

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.480 
anticipate that we'd be changing
operating<00:02:05.330> system<00:02:05.630> soft<00:02:05.960> as<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:06.320> are<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.280> so

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
operating system soft as we are and so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.859 
operating system soft as we are and so
we<00:02:07.640> built<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.210> lot<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.479> our<00:02:08.570> own<00:02:08.660> proprietary

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
we built a lot of our own proprietary

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.440 
we built a lot of our own proprietary
