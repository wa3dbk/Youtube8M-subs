00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
as possible because as we get older we

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.240 
as possible because as we get older we
tend<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.420> lose<00:02:47.870> hairs<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.590> they<00:02:48.650> tend<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> thin

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
tend to lose hairs and they tend to thin

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.140 
tend to lose hairs and they tend to thin
out<00:02:49.430> anyway

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
out anyway

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.420 
out anyway
so<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.900> want<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.230> hold<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.799> as<00:02:51.920> much<00:02:52.160> hair

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so you want to hold on to as much hair

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:02.800 
so you want to hold on to as much hair
as<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.640> can<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.610> I'm<00:03:01.700> just<00:03:02.000> taking<00:03:02.450> off<00:03:02.569> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.020 
as you can so I'm just taking off the
extras<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.829> then<00:03:03.950> I'm<00:03:04.069> gonna<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.640> with

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
extras and then I'm gonna go back with

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:16.640 
extras and then I'm gonna go back with
the<00:03:05.180> tweezer<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.959> shape<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.620> be<00:03:06.769> more<00:03:06.950> precise

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.530 

I'm<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:18.069> back<00:03:18.370> with<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.819> tweezer<00:03:19.090> I'm

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
I'm going back with the tweezer I'm

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.660 
I'm going back with the tweezer I'm
going<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.019> start<00:03:20.379> from<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.709> center<00:03:21.099> again<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
going to start from the center again and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.789 
going to start from the center again and
then<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.390> top<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.840> both<00:03:23.049> sides<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:23.620> then<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
then the top of both sides and then the

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.380 
then the top of both sides and then the
bottom<00:03:24.129> of<00:03:24.250> both<00:03:24.400> sides<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.939> like<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.209> did

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
bottom of both sides just like I did

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.490 
bottom of both sides just like I did
with<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.629> wax<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:28.180> I'm<00:03:28.269> just<00:03:28.480> cleaning<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.079> any

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
with the wax so I'm just cleaning up any

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.770 
with the wax so I'm just cleaning up any
extra<00:03:30.159> hairs<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> wax<00:03:30.939> didn't<00:03:31.360> take<00:03:31.540> out

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
extra hairs that the wax didn't take out

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.039 
extra hairs that the wax didn't take out
and<00:03:32.260> making<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.400> shape<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:34.000> clean<00:03:34.629> and

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
and making the shape as clean and

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:46.840 
and making the shape as clean and
precise<00:03:35.500> as<00:03:35.739> possible

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.100 

so<00:03:47.850> I'm<00:03:47.940> doing<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.360> little<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.840> each<00:03:49.200> side

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
so I'm doing a little bit of each side

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.870 
so I'm doing a little bit of each side
instead<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.530> finishing<00:03:53.130> one<00:03:53.490> whole

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
instead of just finishing one whole

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.910 
instead of just finishing one whole
eyebrow<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.840> then<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.890> other

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
eyebrow and then going on to the other

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
eyebrow and then going on to the other
one<00:03:56.280> because<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.780> back<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.260> forth

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
one because I like to go back and forth

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
one because I like to go back and forth
so<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.709> can<00:03:58.830> get<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.340> nice<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.610> even<00:04:00.000> because

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
so you can get it nice and even because

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.600 
so you can get it nice and even because
the<00:04:00.660> hairs<00:04:00.870> are<00:04:01.080> not<00:04:01.110> placed<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> same

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
the hairs are not placed in the same

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.650 
the hairs are not placed in the same
spot<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.420> both<00:04:03.630> brows<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.270> want<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.540> just

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:16.780 
spot on both brows so you want to just
work<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.989> little<00:04:07.140> bit<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> time
