perching<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.159> group<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> thugs<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
perching over a group of thugs about to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529 
perching over a group of thugs about to
attack<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> civilian<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.190> might<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
attack a civilian this might be one of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.979 
attack a civilian this might be one of
the<00:02:10.220> many<00:02:11.220> riots<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.239> encounter<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the many riots that you encounter in the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
the many riots that you encounter in the
game

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
game

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.589 
game
so<00:02:13.829> that'll<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.219> cool<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.609> see<00:02:14.640> every<00:02:15.060> way<00:02:15.359> like

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
so that'll be cool to see every way like

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.809 
so that'll be cool to see every way like
everything<00:02:15.989> plays<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.680> said<00:02:17.310> these<00:02:17.519> riots

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
everything plays out it said these riots

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.780 
everything plays out it said these riots
can<00:02:18.209> hold<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.629> 50<00:02:19.319> characters<00:02:19.799> at<00:02:20.219> once<00:02:20.519> on

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
can hold up to 50 characters at once on

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.420 
can hold up to 50 characters at once on
screen<00:02:21.719> so<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.650> obviously<00:02:22.829> looks<00:02:23.249> like<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
screen so this obviously looks like a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.119 
screen so this obviously looks like a
much<00:02:23.730> more<00:02:23.909> smaller<00:02:24.450> scale<00:02:25.019> type<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.530> riot<00:02:25.799> if

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
much more smaller scale type of riot if

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.890 
much more smaller scale type of riot if
it<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.730> riot<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.689> is<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:30.090> either<00:02:30.209> way<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
it is a riot that is but either way this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.690 
it is a riot that is but either way this
is<00:02:31.079> another<00:02:31.379> awesome<00:02:31.680> shot<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.159> Batman<00:02:32.280> he's

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
is another awesome shot of Batman he's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.819 
is another awesome shot of Batman he's
ready<00:02:32.969> to<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.209> down<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.659> beat<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.439> crap<00:02:34.560> out

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
ready to go down and beat the crap out

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.309 
ready to go down and beat the crap out
of<00:02:34.859> some<00:02:35.099> thugs<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.420> last<00:02:36.450> shot

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
of some thugs and then the last shot

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.530 
of some thugs and then the last shot
here<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.889> have<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> new<00:02:38.819> picture<00:02:39.359> of

the<00:02:40.409> Arkham<00:02:40.950> Knight<00:02:41.310> now<00:02:42.030> there<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.840> something

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the Arkham Knight now there is something

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.599 
the Arkham Knight now there is something
very<00:02:43.230> interesting<00:02:43.889> about<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.400> picture

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
very interesting about this picture

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.309 
very interesting about this picture
because<00:02:44.939> a<00:02:44.969> lot<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.209> people<00:02:45.299> speculated<00:02:46.079> this

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
because a lot of people speculated this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.470 
because a lot of people speculated this
about<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> Arkham<00:02:46.919> Knight<00:02:47.099> back<00:02:47.730> when<00:02:48.090> he<00:02:48.389> was

about the Arkham Knight back when he was
originally<00:02:48.870> revealed<00:02:49.349> when<00:02:50.219> you<00:02:50.400> zoom<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.060> on

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.619 
his face here you can see that there's
some<00:02:54.750> sort<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.669> information<00:02:56.669> being<00:02:57.060> fed<00:02:57.599> to

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
some sort of information being fed to

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.170 
some sort of information being fed to
him<00:02:58.049> on<00:02:58.349> his<00:02:58.590> helmet<00:02:59.040> there<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.549> this<00:03:00.030> was

him on his helmet there and this was

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.149 
him on his helmet there and this was
something<00:03:00.389> that<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.750> originally<00:03:01.379> saw<00:03:01.709> with

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
something that we originally saw with

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
people are saying that this could mean

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.240 
people are saying that this could mean
he's<00:03:07.500> robot<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.689> absolutely<00:03:09.689> positively<00:03:10.250> don't

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
he's robot I absolutely positively don't

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.539 
he's robot I absolutely positively don't
believe<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.329> true<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:13.500> um<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:14.099> any<00:03:14.430> case

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
believe that's true but um in any case

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.089 
believe that's true but um in any case
some<00:03:15.209> sort<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.569> information<00:03:16.199> is<00:03:16.379> being<00:03:16.680> fed<00:03:17.069> to

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
some sort of information is being fed to

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.610 
some sort of information is being fed to
him<00:03:17.340> through<00:03:17.849> his<00:03:17.879> helmet<00:03:18.479> and<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:19.409> is<00:03:19.560> very

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
him through his helmet and that is very

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.670 
him through his helmet and that is very
interesting<00:03:21.109> this<00:03:22.109> could<00:03:22.470> lead<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.859> UM<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:24.269> how

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
interesting this could lead to UM to how

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.839 
interesting this could lead to UM to how
originally<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.799> heard<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.519> Arkham

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
originally we heard that the Arkham

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.099 
originally we heard that the Arkham
Knight<00:03:27.030> pretty<00:03:27.419> much<00:03:27.569> knows<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> lot<00:03:28.049> about

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
Knight pretty much knows a lot about

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.949 
Knight pretty much knows a lot about
Batman<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.979> maybe<00:03:29.609> it's<00:03:30.389> because<00:03:30.599> of<00:03:30.810> this

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
Batman and maybe it's because of this

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.539 
Batman and maybe it's because of this
information<00:03:31.229> is<00:03:31.590> being<00:03:31.739> fed<00:03:31.979> to<00:03:32.009> him<00:03:32.250> through

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
information is being fed to him through

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.699 
information is being fed to him through
his<00:03:32.609> helmet<00:03:32.939> like<00:03:33.150> he'd<00:03:33.900> told<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.470> thugs

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
his helmet like he'd told the thugs

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.499 
his helmet like he'd told the thugs
where<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.189> shoot<00:03:35.400> Batman<00:03:35.639> where<00:03:36.120> his<00:03:36.329> most

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:36.509 
where to shoot Batman where his most

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.159 
where to shoot Batman where his most
armored<00:03:37.049> part<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.979> his<00:03:38.220> suit<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.019> like

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
armored part of his suit is so it's like

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.719 
armored part of his suit is so it's like
he<00:03:40.379> knew<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:40.859> information<00:03:41.129> about<00:03:41.519> him

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
he knew all this information about him

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.969 
he knew all this information about him
maybe<00:03:42.239> that's<00:03:42.509> because<00:03:42.689> of<00:03:42.989> this<00:03:43.079> stuff<00:03:43.349> that

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
maybe that's because of this stuff that

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.409 
maybe that's because of this stuff that
he's<00:03:44.220> being<00:03:44.400> fed<00:03:44.729> through<00:03:44.759> his<00:03:45.030> helmet<00:03:45.329> I

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
he's being fed through his helmet I

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.479 
he's being fed through his helmet I
