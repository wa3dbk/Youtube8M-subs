00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.489
 two 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 good alberto very good morning tell us 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.509
 some where have you brought us to 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.179
 present us a new block work if 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.010
 get fernando look at this mod in san 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 gracious 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.520
 the new project is about two 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 cabins the development of two floors 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 that with logical systems is the concept 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.270
 that has been used to make this kind of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 that good we remember a little what are 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.170
 the materials that the system uses 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 blocks and at what stage of work are we 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:43.030
 well we are the first stage of work 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.210
 the materials are the typical blocks 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.750
 of the system with the anchor with the system 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 lock with wedges 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.740
 this is the inter system that has 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.230
 this weight also belongs to the system 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.200
 local good we see the rods that are 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.150
 they see that they come from the bed if this one 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.640
 is living is living these 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.850
 cabins have been developed two floors 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 and they have an interesting density of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.520
 anchors that clarify the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 foundation towards this ceiling good enough 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.070
 neat the work that has to do with the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.400
 skilled labor the work is very 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.229
 Neat and labor 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.869
 is qualified because it is a car 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.300
 construction or is it a family that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.369
 is building his cabins good 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.930
 let's talk then a little bit with 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.030
 Mauricio Good morning 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 good day hello how are you doing fernando 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 Mauricio Gasparini we are here to put 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 our our project of these two 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.830
 cabins that we are doing with the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 block system 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.189
 let 's say it 's a big change in terms of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.990
 method because before we have 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.119
 our first house that looks a bit 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.159
 to the bottom and we did it with the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.049
 traditional wet-way system 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.520
 let's say and what good it entailed and entails 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.649
 many difficulties in terms of 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.720
 availability of materials being 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.720
 making permanently mix and 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.700
 fundamentally the workforce 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.739
 us with a little guidance and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.709
 advice on everything the material 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.360
 of block and making a good 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.519
 planning with my wife friends and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.519
 good and jobs too but one goes 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.580
 resolving the issue and with enough 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.360
 quickly I see the lace hairs of 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.400
 columns 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.980
 I know that the block system takes us 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.310
 column because the equipment in first 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.709
 place because when we started the work 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.380
 we did not know this system of this 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.050
 then we had planned for the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.130
 traditional and good system in each 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.560
 corner a column 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.260
 and so and then we started 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.620
 afterwards since we had them armed 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.680
 we continue up but simply 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.020
 that's why we kept the hairs of the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.060
 columns told me off camera the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.870
 time that you have delayed in building 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.799
 to tell us a bit what was 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.920
 look summarizing let's say in the 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.140
 opportunities that we have come in two 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.319
 end of full weeks of four 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.860
 full days four days five 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 at most 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.360
 We have arrived between three people 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.380
 practically at the intel level of all 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.310
 an area of 8 meters 50 by 6 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.920
 and with the intermediate division and everything is 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.160
 Pretty fast, it's easy for you 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.370
 work with this system 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.790
 it's very fast it's easy to say because it's 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.010
 One is when you find the way 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.760
 let's say to the method of going to go putting 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.760
 wedges 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.010
 it's pretty simple, good aurich yo 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.680
 thank you very much let's talk about 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.740
 so now a little bit with patricia 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.470
 responsible for which block is here in 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.440
 san clemente in some way because it was 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.650
 the first one that I experienced the program this 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.870
 and well I bought it from the beginning not only 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.090
 I had to submit in some way to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.010
 trial of mauricio and good what 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.870
 we talk when he concedes and that he 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.150
 He hooked him to see to give me 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.270
 roll I had already contacted me with 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.190
 sand lady and well well we're not going 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.650
 to meet a person who does not 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 are we say ready to help 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.940
 because it is a new and good system of 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 somehow I compared it too 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.550
 with what was the execution of the other 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.580
 work that like us is good in 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.080
 Actually we do very lung 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.930
 the family not true this is a 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.640
 good family entrepreneurship we stumble 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.060
 with everything that involved let's say 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.830
 really needs manpower to 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.230
 to make mixes for this because 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.900
 neither of us is neither an architect 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.810
 no mason let's say 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.110
 then we needed more strength 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.410
 of work to incorporate and it's not a 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.180
 place where you can come or not have 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.580
 access is to say good we use the the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.229
 indigo comes because it is not the place 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.050
 We are 100 kilometers from CÃ³rdoba 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.590
 full saw and well I think the system 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.970
 for me this I even saw it as something 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.389
 playful is a web or return say to 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.180
 armed with blocks nothing with blocks 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.930
 when one played with blocks of 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.850
 tennis if I did not want to tell the brand not 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.340
 be and well I know that mauricio is not 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.970
 very plastic and flexible in all that and 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.470
 good help Mr. Sandy has been 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.470
 wonderful we are doing we are in 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.840
 construction as they sought only not 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.449
 barbarians fast and I'm anxious as 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.560
 every woman and want to have dad 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.410
 good 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.030
 we all work and you can, I've 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.550
 put in the paint of the teeth he 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.130
 is that it also implies protection 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.490
 let's say for the work and not wonderful 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.590
 we are very happy I am good 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.660
 happy with what I saw and would return it to 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.910
 buy I think so far at least 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.320
 this is not good experience 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.540
 thank you very much for sad for 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.750
 to have allowed us in good cardigan for 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.980
 are welcome here mauricio 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.419
 thank you very much thank you very much for the 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.889
 visit 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.040
 alberto good we have complied with what 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.729
 we said the last note that we were going to 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.680
 show someone who does 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.680
 self-construction and it seems that it has happened 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.370
 the test I thank fernando very much if 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.370
 the following pressures
