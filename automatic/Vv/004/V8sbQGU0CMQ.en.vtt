in<00:02:26.960> mind<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.440> tethered<00:02:27.890> jailbreak<00:02:28.420> you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
in mind this is a tethered jailbreak you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.470 
in mind this is a tethered jailbreak you
will<00:02:29.660> have<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.520> plug<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.670> back<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:31.970> itunes

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
will have to plug it back into itunes

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.180 
will have to plug it back into itunes
and<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.140> boot<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.470> tethered<00:02:33.680> which<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and just boot it tethered which is the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.550 
and just boot it tethered which is the
next<00:02:34.460> step<00:02:34.580> we're<00:02:34.730> going<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.110> every<00:02:36.110> single

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
next step we're going to do every single

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.460 
next step we're going to do every single
time<00:02:36.770> your<00:02:36.920> device<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.310> dies<00:02:37.490> or<00:02:38.200> reboots<00:02:39.200> or

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
time your device it dies or reboots or

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.580 
time your device it dies or reboots or
powers<00:02:39.920> off<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:40.400> anything<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.590> you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
powers off or anything like that you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.790 
powers off or anything like that you
will<00:02:42.800> have<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.600> plug<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.140> run<00:02:45.560> redsnow

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
will have to plug it in and run redsnow

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.480 
will have to plug it in and run redsnow
again<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:49.220> moving

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
again and now it's just moving

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.910 
again and now it's just moving
applications<00:02:50.300> which<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.410> usually<00:02:51.800> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
applications which is usually the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.520 
applications which is usually the
longest<00:02:52.400> part<00:02:52.840> takes<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.020> whole<00:02:54.290> minute

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
longest part takes like a whole minute

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.520 
longest part takes like a whole minute
maybe<00:02:54.800> two<00:02:54.890> minutes<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.430> do<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.320> if<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.410> guys

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
maybe two minutes to do so if you guys

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.730 
maybe two minutes to do so if you guys
want<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.860> skip<00:02:58.070> ahead<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:03:00.620> just

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
want to skip ahead you can I'm just

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.380 
want to skip ahead you can I'm just
going<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.950> let<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.190> run<00:03:01.400> until<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:02.060> does<00:03:02.209> what

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
going to let it run until it does what

00:03:02.390 --> 00:04:09.040 
going to let it run until it does what
you<00:03:02.420> used<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.660> do

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.800 

okay<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:09.800> now<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.070> device<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.520> going<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.910> boot

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
okay so now the device is going to boot

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
okay so now the device is going to boot
back<00:04:12.020> up<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:14.830> then<00:04:15.830> we<00:04:16.130> still<00:04:16.430> can't<00:04:16.640> even

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
back up and then we still can't even

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.229 
back up and then we still can't even
really<00:04:16.910> use<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:18.160> city<00:04:19.160> will<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.519> just<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.880> plain

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
really use it city will be just a plain

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:39.940 
really use it city will be just a plain
white<00:04:20.480> icon

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.070 

okay<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.210> now<00:04:41.330> we<00:04:41.390> can<00:04:41.540> just<00:04:41.600> slide<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.900> unlock

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
okay so now we can just slide to unlock

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.190 
okay so now we can just slide to unlock
there<00:04:43.040> is<00:04:43.220> city<00:04:43.490> right<00:04:43.790> there<00:04:44.060> but<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.900> course

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
there is city right there but of course

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.940 
there is city right there but of course
it<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.760> just<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.850> white<00:04:47.060> icon<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:47.690> we<00:04:48.470> can't<00:04:48.710> use

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
it is just a white icon and we can't use

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.800 
it is just a white icon and we can't use
it<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.370> now<00:04:49.550> you're<00:04:49.880> going<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.240> run<00:04:50.510> redsnow

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
it so now you're going to run redsnow

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.260 
it so now you're going to run redsnow
again<00:04:52.210> browse<00:04:53.210> for<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.540> same<00:04:53.810> firmware<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
again browse for the same firmware and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.210 
again browse for the same firmware and
whenever<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.510> done<00:04:59.600> hit<00:04:59.870> next<00:05:00.110> it'll<00:05:01.010> patch

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
whenever it's done hit next it'll patch

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.370 
whenever it's done hit next it'll patch
and<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.490> what<00:05:01.580> he<00:05:01.640> needs<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.880> do<00:05:07.600> ok<00:05:08.600> so<00:05:08.660> now<00:05:09.050> on

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
and do what he needs to do ok so now on

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.010 
and do what he needs to do ok so now on
this<00:05:09.560> step<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:10.520> are<00:05:10.550> going<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:11.090> just<00:05:11.480> boot

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
this step we are going to just boot

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.990 
this step we are going to just boot
tethered<00:05:12.530> right<00:05:12.710> now<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.160> just<00:05:13.190> check<00:05:13.820> that

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
tethered right now so just check that

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.550 
tethered right now so just check that
this<00:05:14.240> is<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.480> step<00:05:14.750> you're<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.050> do<00:05:15.170> every

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
this is a step you're going to do every

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.410 
this is a step you're going to do every
single<00:05:15.740> time<00:05:16.040> we<00:05:16.190> device<00:05:16.430> dives<00:05:16.730> reboots<00:05:17.300> or

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
single time we device dives reboots or

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.630 
single time we device dives reboots or
powers<00:05:17.720> off<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.590> do<00:05:18.740> have<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:19.010> connect<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.520> to

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
powers off you do have to connect it to

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.190 
powers off you do have to connect it to
a<00:05:19.670> computer<00:05:19.760> because<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.330> is<00:05:20.540> tethered<00:05:20.930> feels

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
a computer because it is tethered feels

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.200 
a computer because it is tethered feels
untethered<00:05:21.980> you<00:05:22.610> wouldn't<00:05:22.850> have<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.060> worry

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
untethered you wouldn't have to worry

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.250 
untethered you wouldn't have to worry
about<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.480> but<00:05:23.720> there's<00:05:23.870> not<00:05:24.020> going<00:05:24.140> to<00:05:24.200> be

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
about this but there's not going to be

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.170 
about this but there's not going to be
an<00:05:24.350> untethered<00:05:24.620> for<00:05:24.890> this<00:05:25.040> because<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.730> mean

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
an untethered for this because I mean

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.400 
an untethered for this because I mean
Iowa's<00:05:26.540> five<00:05:26.750> is<00:05:26.930> right<00:05:27.110> around<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.350> corner

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
Iowa's five is right around the corner

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.070 
Iowa's five is right around the corner
and<00:05:27.980> I<00:05:28.400> don't<00:05:29.210> see<00:05:29.390> these<00:05:29.540> jailbreakers

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
and I don't see these jailbreakers

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.500 
and I don't see these jailbreakers
wasting<00:05:30.500> their<00:05:30.650> time<00:05:30.830> doing<00:05:31.240> some<00:05:32.240> simple

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
wasting their time doing some simple

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.850 
wasting their time doing some simple
little<00:05:32.780> joburg<00:05:33.170> like<00:05:33.320> this<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.650> be<00:05:33.740> on

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
little joburg like this to be on

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.310 
little joburg like this to be on
tethered<00:05:34.220> so<00:05:34.850> go<00:05:35.180> ahead<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.540> power<00:05:36.020> off<00:05:36.290> your

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
tethered so go ahead and power off your

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:44.719 
tethered so go ahead and power off your
device<00:05:36.500> again<00:05:37.990> slide<00:05:38.990> power<00:05:39.410> off

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.239 

and<00:05:44.939> there<00:05:45.779> we<00:05:45.900> go<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.620> now<00:05:46.650> we're<00:05:46.949> going<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.129> do

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:47.249 
and there we go so now we're going to do

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.170 
and there we go so now we're going to do
that<00:05:47.370> same<00:05:47.430> trick<00:05:47.879> again<00:05:47.939> hold<00:05:48.509> both<00:05:48.779> one<00:05:49.289> two

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
that same trick again hold both one two
