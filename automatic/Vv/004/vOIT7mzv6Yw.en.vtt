 r 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.089
 the perpetrators had on 19 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.129
 Bulgaria will 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.669
 They are easy to fold and are great for children's birthdays 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.989
 Origami looks fresher the really spring 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.319
 for tinkering we only need if legs and rectangular paper 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.279
 preferably green 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.750
 who folds the paper once with himself and after Dortmund again to 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 mitwippen 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.820
 on the back, fold the two tips to the middle 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.340
 at the moment we are only dealing with one half of the paper the other 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 Half arrives later 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 still click on the back if now the edge inside 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.770
 so that a triangle is created 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.120
 whose right-hand tip we now fold to the middle and then back to the grave 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 had known pages 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 with the left-tip method we do the same 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.890
 All the steps that have been taken so far repeat with the other one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 half 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.299
 Known as the lure tip tip buckle tip cantor tip 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 if we are sure we'll just watch the last 60 seconds of this movie 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.790
 once again 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.930
 we create a cancer-inhibiting by standing the upper square meter 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.960
 at this line folds like the left and the right edge of the square 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 now we already recognize the head and the rump 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 in the latter wrinkles like the tip so upwards that while the little ones 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.399
 Do not enter your legs 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 the resulting pockets want to stick the tips of the two 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 bridge parts 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.689
 on the bottom folds like the entire rump to middle and 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 delete if done 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.400
 After that we keep half of it back again 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 Foldable when smoothing a little firmer press it because many 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 lay paper that make up the ankle 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.069
 after the common tinkering can now on the children's birthday the 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.980
 Championships in long jump
