00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.590 
bring out the depth of the trail that's
what<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:01:00.010> liking<00:01:00.430> about<00:01:00.550> this<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:00.969> much<00:01:01.120> and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
what I'm liking about this so much and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.090 
what I'm liking about this so much and
we've<00:01:01.960> all<00:01:02.140> been<00:01:02.350> out<00:01:02.440> there<00:01:02.620> running<00:01:03.010> if

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
we've all been out there running if

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.399 
we've all been out there running if
we've<00:01:03.250> had<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.399> headlamp<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:04.119> where<00:01:04.659> our<00:01:05.080> beam

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
we've had a headlamp on where our beam

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.620 
we've had a headlamp on where our beam
seems<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.009> be<00:01:06.130> zigzagging<00:01:06.430> back<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.119> forth

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
seems to be zigzagging back and forth

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.240 
seems to be zigzagging back and forth
wherever<00:01:08.020> we're<00:01:08.259> looking<00:01:08.560> which<00:01:08.950> really

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
wherever we're looking which really

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.370 
wherever we're looking which really
gives<00:01:09.460> us<00:01:09.670> kind<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.119> motion<00:01:10.420> sickness<00:01:10.960> feel

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
gives us kind of a motion sickness feel

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.920 
gives us kind of a motion sickness feel
to<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.979> I'm<00:01:12.640> convinced<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.180> go<00:01:13.450> motion

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
to it and I'm convinced that go motion

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.690 
to it and I'm convinced that go motion
is<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.380> allow<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.860> run<00:01:15.130> without

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
is going to allow you to run without

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.730 
is going to allow you to run without
kind<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.300> seasickness<00:01:16.930> feeling<00:01:17.530> once

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
kind of that seasickness feeling once

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.530 
kind of that seasickness feeling once
you<00:01:17.860> go<00:01:17.950> out<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.340> trail<00:01:18.580> so<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.119> get<00:01:19.330> more

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
you go out on the trail so you get more

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.539 
you go out on the trail so you get more
depth<00:01:19.899> less<00:01:20.440> likely<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:20.950> trip<00:01:21.130> over<00:01:21.250> things

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
depth less likely to trip over things

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.550 
depth less likely to trip over things
better<00:01:22.090> clarity<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.840> what<00:01:22.990> you're<00:01:23.140> looking

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
better clarity and what you're looking

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.320

both<00:01:41.890> going<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.159> trying<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.819> one

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
both going to be trying out this one

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.350 
both going to be trying out this one
right<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.659> for<00:01:44.289> my<00:01:44.520> backpack<00:01:45.520> we're

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
right here and for my backpack we're

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.300 
right here and for my backpack we're
going<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.539> be<00:01:46.630> trying<00:01:46.840> out<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.500> clip<00:01:48.009> system

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
going to be trying out a clip system

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to be trying out a clip system
that<00:01:48.909> goes<00:01:49.090> right<00:01:49.450> onto<00:01:49.720> my<00:01:50.020> hydration<00:01:50.500> pack

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
that goes right onto my hydration pack

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.710 
that goes right onto my hydration pack
so<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.310> think<00:01:51.429> that's<00:01:51.789> going<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.210> lot<00:01:52.690> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
so I think that's going to be a lot of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.309 
so I think that's going to be a lot of
fun<00:01:52.960> as<00:01:53.530> well<00:01:54.300> called<00:01:55.300> our<00:01:55.420> sternum<00:01:55.840> light<00:01:56.020> kit

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
built-in features real quickly that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.260 
built-in features real quickly that
depth<00:02:04.070> perception<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.670> you're<00:02:04.880> talking<00:02:05.000> about

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
depth perception is you're talking about

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.120 
depth perception is you're talking about
with<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.630> headlamp<00:02:06.050> yep<00:02:06.350> what's<00:02:06.740> happening

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
with the headlamp yep what's happening

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
the same angle you actually don't

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.040 
the same angle you actually don't
physically<00:02:10.430> see<00:02:10.670> much<00:02:10.850> for<00:02:11.060> shattuck<00:02:11.510> yep<00:02:11.750> if

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
physically see much for shattuck yep if

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.510 
physically see much for shattuck yep if
