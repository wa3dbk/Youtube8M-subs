00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
to put it on the tilt like this and
that's<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> top<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.210> our<00:01:42.329> poké

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that's going to be the top of our poké

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's going to be the top of our poké
ball<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> we're<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:45.290> bright

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
ball and we're going to make it a bright

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.410 
ball and we're going to make it a bright
red<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.920> that's<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.060> third<00:01:48.689> red<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> red

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
red so that's the third red on the red

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 
red so that's the third red on the red
column<00:01:52.130> next<00:01:53.130> we're<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> copy<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
column next we're going to copy and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
column next we're going to copy and
paste<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.750> make<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
paste it and we're going to make it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.440 
paste it and we're going to make it
white<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> we're<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.360> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
white and we're just going to put it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.090 
white and we're just going to put it
right<00:01:57.750> below<00:01:58.020> it

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.199 

like<00:02:01.760> so<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:04.630> now<00:02:05.630> we're<00:02:05.990> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.290> grab<00:02:07.209> this

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
like so and now we're going to grab this

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.600 
like so and now we're going to grab this
curved<00:02:08.630> line<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.709> we're<00:02:10.369> going<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.520> make

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
curved line here and we're going to make

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.570 
curved line here and we're going to make
it<00:02:10.759> black<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.580> make

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
it black and we're going to have to make

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.580 
it black and we're going to have to make
it<00:02:13.760> thinner<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:16.630> curved<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.350> looks

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
it thinner and curved so that looks

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.030 
it thinner and curved so that looks
pretty<00:02:18.890> good<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.750> think<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.860> want

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
pretty good just like so I think I want

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.280 
pretty good just like so I think I want
a<00:02:22.069> little<00:02:22.280> bit<00:02:22.370> more<00:02:22.520> curve<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.239> my<00:02:23.360> line<00:02:23.690> so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
a little bit more curve to my line so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.820 
a little bit more curve to my line so
I'm<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.800> something<00:02:25.130> like<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.640> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
I'm going to do something like that and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.080 
I'm going to do something like that and
large<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.190> don't<00:02:28.370> want<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.640> line<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.850> be

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
large it you don't want the line to be

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.640 
large it you don't want the line to be
too<00:02:29.330> thick<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.930> don't<00:02:30.080> want<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.260> too<00:02:30.380> thin

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
too thick but you don't want it too thin

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.400 
too thick but you don't want it too thin
either<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.450> looks<00:02:32.569> ok<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.170> now<00:02:33.290> we've

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
either so so that looks ok and now we've

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.880 
either so so that looks ok and now we've
got<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.620> adjust<00:02:33.739> again<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.650> got<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:36.860> that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
got to adjust again so got to do that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.850 
got to adjust again so got to do that
and<00:02:37.489> there<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.420> go<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.810> that's<00:02:38.989> pretty<00:02:39.769> much

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and there you go so that's pretty much

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740 
and there you go so that's pretty much
how<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.160> want<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.819> think<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.360> want<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.569> put

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
how I want it but I think I want to put

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.740 
how I want it but I think I want to put
in<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:42.260> bit<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.800> tilt<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.750> just

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
in a little bit more of a tilt here just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.800 
in a little bit more of a tilt here just
like<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:47.739> there<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:48.920> go<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.819> just<00:02:50.269> fix<00:02:50.600> up

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
like that there we go and just fix up

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.050 
like that there we go and just fix up
everything<00:02:51.290> else<00:02:51.410> that's<00:02:52.040> not<00:02:52.600> aligned<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
everything else that's not aligned and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.170 
everything else that's not aligned and
yeah<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.450> looks<00:02:56.660> good<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.319> now

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
yeah so that looks good all right now

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.150 
yeah so that looks good all right now
what<00:02:59.180> we're<00:02:59.299> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.480> do<00:02:59.569> here<00:02:59.600> is<00:03:00.080> we<00:03:00.980> need

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
what we're going to do here is we need

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.630 
what we're going to do here is we need
to<00:03:01.370> grab<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:05.140> circle<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.380> believe<00:03:06.829> right<00:03:07.130> it's

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
to grab the circle I believe right it's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.900 
to grab the circle I believe right it's
the<00:03:07.850> circle<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:09.230> we're<00:03:09.380> going<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> go<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:12.910> grab

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
the circle so we're going to go and grab

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.190 
the circle so we're going to go and grab
that<00:03:14.049> circle<00:03:15.049> make<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> smaller<00:03:16.549> make<00:03:17.200> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
that circle make it smaller make it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.220 
that circle make it smaller make it
black<00:03:19.299> well<00:03:20.299> let's<00:03:20.480> quickly<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.989> know<00:03:21.079> what

tilted so i'll say okay you know what
yeah<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.239> tilt<00:03:32.570> looks<00:03:32.870> fun<00:03:33.109> so<00:03:33.470> we're<00:03:33.590> just

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
yeah this tilt looks fun so we're just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.370 
yeah this tilt looks fun so we're just
going<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.859> readjust<00:03:34.190> everything<00:03:35.380> according

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
going to readjust everything according

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.160 
going to readjust everything according
to<00:03:38.739> space

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
to space

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.120 
to space
the<00:03:41.770> space<00:03:42.130> required<00:03:42.550> here<00:03:43.620> put<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.800> little

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
the space required here put this little

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.790 
the space required here put this little
bigger<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.870> red<00:03:47.050> still<00:03:47.349> good<00:03:47.530> okay<00:03:47.739> so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
bigger and the red still good okay so

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.589 
bigger and the red still good okay so
now<00:03:48.069> we've<00:03:48.220> got<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.520> circle<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.360> because

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
now we've got the circle but because

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.930 
now we've got the circle but because
we're<00:03:49.720> putting<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.020> tilt<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.500> needed<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.940> be

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
we're putting on a tilt we needed to be

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.229 
we're putting on a tilt we needed to be
a<00:03:51.970> little<00:03:52.239> bit<00:03:52.390> more<00:03:53.610> like<00:03:54.610> because<00:03:54.910> it's<00:03:55.090> on

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
a little bit more like because it's on

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.059 
a little bit more like because it's on
an<00:03:55.390> angle<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:56.080> need<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.440> make<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.739> circle

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
an angle you need to make the circle

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.270 
an angle you need to make the circle
more<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.340> an<00:03:57.430> oval<00:03:57.580> shape<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:59.280> so

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
more of an oval shape like so and so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.070 
more of an oval shape like so and so
that's<00:04:01.030> going<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.239> be<00:04:01.300> good<00:04:01.540> i'm<00:04:01.780> going<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.959> put

that's going to be good i'm going to put
it<00:04:02.170> right<00:04:02.650> here<00:04:04.410> maybe<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.190> bit

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it right here maybe just a little bit

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.430 
it right here maybe just a little bit
fatter<00:04:06.850> there<00:04:07.269> we<00:04:07.360> go<00:04:07.510> i'm<00:04:08.050> going<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.230> take<00:04:08.410> a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
fatter there we go i'm going to take a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.350 
fatter there we go i'm going to take a
copy<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.980> paste<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.700> you're<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.300> to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
copy and paste it and you're going to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.990 
copy and paste it and you're going to
make<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.540> white<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.489> go<00:04:12.640> right

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
make it white and it's going to go right

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.509 
make it white and it's going to go right
in<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.330> like<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.530> take<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> again<00:04:15.040> copy

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
in there like so you take it again copy

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.819 
in there like so you take it again copy
and<00:04:15.730> paste<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.150> make<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.510> black<00:04:16.750> but<00:04:17.650> instead

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
and paste it make it black but instead

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.780 
and paste it make it black but instead
of<00:04:17.950> making<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.430> center<00:04:18.639> you're

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
of making it right in the center you're

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.159 
of making it right in the center you're
going<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:18.970> push<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.359> little<00:04:19.389> bit<00:04:19.870> just<00:04:20.019> to

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
going to push it a little bit just to

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.590 
going to push it a little bit just to
the<00:04:20.320> side<00:04:20.500> there<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.910> we're<00:04:22.240> going<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.389> copy

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
the side there and we're going to copy

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.090 
the side there and we're going to copy
and<00:04:22.720> paste<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.990> one<00:04:23.200> more<00:04:23.350> time<00:04:23.530> but<00:04:24.010> instead

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
and paste it one more time but instead

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.350 
and paste it one more time but instead
of<00:04:24.340> making<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.669> white<00:04:24.880> we're<00:04:25.060> going<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.240> make

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
of making it white we're going to make

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.770 
of making it white we're going to make
it<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.540> little<00:04:25.720> bit<00:04:25.930> grey<00:04:27.419> just<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.510> give<00:04:28.660> it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
it a little bit grey just to give it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.000 
it a little bit grey just to give it
more<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.490> better<00:04:30.490> feel<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.950> just

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
more of a better feel to it and just

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.260 
more of a better feel to it and just
going<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.000> fix<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.360> one<00:04:34.750> right<00:04:34.900> here<00:04:34.990> and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
going to fix this one right here and

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.670 
going to fix this one right here and
there<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.389> go<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:37.840> that's<00:04:38.020> pretty<00:04:38.229> much<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
there you go so that's pretty much the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.070 
there you go so that's pretty much the
whole<00:04:38.889> dragon<00:04:39.520> ball<00:04:39.790> or<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> trackable<00:04:40.600> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
whole dragon ball or a trackable the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.200 
whole dragon ball or a trackable the
pokeball<00:04:41.650> there<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.160> we're<00:04:42.910> pretty<00:04:43.030> much

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
pokeball there and we're pretty much

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.400 
pokeball there and we're pretty much
done<00:04:43.270> here<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:44.650> what<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.950> can<00:04:45.130> do<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:46.410> fix

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
done here but what you can do to fix

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.460 
done here but what you can do to fix
this<00:04:47.560> up<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.950> guess<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.220> could<00:04:48.250> say<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.470> add

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
this up I guess you could say is to add

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.830 
this up I guess you could say is to add
some<00:04:50.860> shades<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.450> easiest<00:04:52.750> way

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
some shades on to it and the easiest way

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840 
some shades on to it and the easiest way
to<00:04:52.900> do<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.229> we<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.800> grab<00:04:54.039> some<00:04:54.400> circles

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
to do this is we can grab some circles

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.140 
to do this is we can grab some circles
and<00:04:56.010> we're<00:04:57.010> going<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.160> make<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.789> a<00:04:57.820> black

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
and we're going to make it have a black

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.300 
and we're going to make it have a black
color<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.660> we're<00:04:58.750> going<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> put<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.350> behind

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
color and we're going to put this behind

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.990 
color and we're going to put this behind
the<00:05:00.970> lines<00:05:02.039> but<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.190> front<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.580> these<00:05:03.700> two

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
the lines but in front of these two

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.690 
the lines but in front of these two
shapes<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.919> we're<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.280> bring<00:05:06.550> the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
shapes here and we're going to bring the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.600 
shapes here and we're going to bring the
opacity<00:05:07.000> down<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:08.440> about<00:05:09.930> 30<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.430> gives

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
opacity down to about 30 so that gives

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.650 
opacity down to about 30 so that gives
it<00:05:12.760> some<00:05:12.910> more<00:05:12.940> depth<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:14.669> color<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.270> so

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
it some more depth and color to it so

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.219 
it some more depth and color to it so
okay<00:05:17.289> let's<00:05:18.479> copy<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:19.660> paste<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.960> one<00:05:20.080> more

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
okay let's copy and paste it one more

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.040 
okay let's copy and paste it one more
time<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.910> put<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.090> front<00:05:22.419> and<00:05:22.600> then<00:05:22.870> make

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
time and put it in front and then make

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.390 
time and put it in front and then make
that<00:05:23.229> one<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.410> little<00:05:23.530> smaller<00:05:23.890> nuts<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.310> can

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
that one a little smaller nuts you can

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.580 
that one a little smaller nuts you can
see<00:05:24.610> makes<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.060> darker<00:05:25.450> shade<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.990> you<00:05:26.440> don't

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
see makes a darker shade and you don't

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.110 
see makes a darker shade and you don't
have<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.800> mess<00:05:26.950> with<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.190> opacity<00:05:27.490> on<00:05:27.850> that

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
have to mess with the opacity on that

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.400 
have to mess with the opacity on that
either<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:29.850> that's<00:05:30.850> pretty<00:05:31.330> much<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.570> so

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
either and that's pretty much it so

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.680 
either and that's pretty much it so
that's<00:05:32.590> what<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:34.080> nice<00:05:35.080> little<00:05:35.530> way<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.860> make<00:05:36.370> a

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
that's what a nice little way to make a

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.820 
that's what a nice little way to make a
pokeball<00:05:37.690> would<00:05:37.840> be<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.229> you<00:05:38.560> could<00:05:38.680> always

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
pokeball would be and you could always

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.180 
pokeball would be and you could always
just<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.250> know<00:05:39.340> tweak<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.789> up<00:05:39.910> how<00:05:40.120> you<00:05:40.180> want

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
just you know tweak it up how you want

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.670 
just you know tweak it up how you want
where<00:05:42.190> you<00:05:42.220> want<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:43.020> tilt<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.200> be<00:05:44.350> in<00:05:44.560> the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
where you want the tilt to be in the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.040 
where you want the tilt to be in the
lines<00:05:44.919> and<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.789> how<00:05:46.419> big<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.870> want

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
lines and the and how big you want

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.750 
lines and the and how big you want
everything<00:05:47.380> like<00:05:47.860> right<00:05:48.039> now<00:05:48.190> I'm<00:05:48.370> just<00:05:48.580> you

everything like right now I'm just you
know<00:05:48.810> fixing<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.930> up<00:05:50.050> but<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.620> don't<00:05:50.770> have<00:05:50.860> to

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
know fixing it up but you don't have to
