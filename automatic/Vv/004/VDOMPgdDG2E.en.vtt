product back in 2006 our process was

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.579 
product back in 2006 our process was
entirely<00:00:44.610> manual<00:00:45.540> this<00:00:45.960> messy<00:00:46.230> process

entirely manual this messy process
time-consuming<00:00:47.580> process<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:49.220> there's<00:00:50.220> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
time-consuming process and there's just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
time-consuming process and there's just
a<00:00:50.430> lot<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.449> took<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.900> we<00:00:52.260> took<00:00:52.410> our

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
a lot of work we took our we took our

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.820 
a lot of work we took our we took our
manual<00:00:52.920> process<00:00:53.400> and<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.790> put<00:00:54.299> it<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.830> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
manual process and we put it into the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.100 
manual process and we put it into the
computer<00:00:56.040> basically<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.239> software<00:00:57.839> now<00:00:58.049> we

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
computer basically with software now we

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.259 
computer basically with software now we
move<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> teeth<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.699> models<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
move all the teeth on the models in the

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.320 
move all the teeth on the models in the
software<00:01:00.720> we<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:01.409> went<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> milling<00:01:02.549> that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
software we then went to milling that

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.990 
software we then went to milling that
was<00:01:03.900> our<00:01:04.019> next<00:01:04.350> phase<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.880> our

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
was our next phase that's that was our

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.890 
was our next phase that's that was our
first<00:01:06.299> step<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:08.030> mechanized<00:01:09.030> manufacturing

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
first step into mechanized manufacturing

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
first step into mechanized manufacturing
a<00:01:10.080> digital<00:01:10.650> process<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.670> were<00:01:11.820> growing<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
a digital process we were growing so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.450 
a digital process we were growing so
fast<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:13.860> demand<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.430> our

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fast there was so much demand for our

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
fast there was so much demand for our
product<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.510> couldn't<00:01:15.750> keep<00:01:15.900> up

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
product that we really couldn't keep up

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.539 
product that we really couldn't keep up
at<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.530> point<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:18.330> 2009<00:01:18.990> later<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:20.040> we're

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
at one point in 2009 later also we're

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.370 
at one point in 2009 later also we're
having<00:01:20.880> 150<00:01:21.720> doctors<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.350> week<00:01:22.650> joining<00:01:23.189> us<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
having 150 doctors a week joining us and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.349 
having 150 doctors a week joining us and
we're<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.920> other<00:01:26.070> middles<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.090> was

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
we're using the other middles and it was

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.490 
we're using the other middles and it was
not<00:01:27.539> going<00:01:27.750> fast<00:01:28.049> enough

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
not going fast enough

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
not going fast enough
we<00:01:28.679> got<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.159> had<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> eight<00:01:29.579> mills<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
we got we had the eight mills it was the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
we got we had the eight mills it was the
first<00:01:30.810> purchase<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.859> buy<00:01:32.009> something

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
first purchase we need to buy something

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.639 
first purchase we need to buy something
else<00:01:32.609> I<00:01:32.759> mean<00:01:32.909> buy<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.359> mills<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
else I mean buy more mills or make a

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.740 
else I mean buy more mills or make a

object<00:01:37.650> came<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.700> discussion<00:01:43.490> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
object came up in that discussion this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.000 
object came up in that discussion this
is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> machine<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.510> go<00:01:45.660> with<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.080> everything

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
is the machine to go with and everything

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.570 
is the machine to go with and everything
else<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.750> needs<00:01:49.260> needs<00:01:49.860> ago<00:01:50.130> we

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
else this you know needs needs ago we

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.150 
else this you know needs needs ago we
started<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.540> printer<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.160> we

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
started with the one printer and we

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.000 
started with the one printer and we
quickly<00:01:53.670> transition<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:55.250> an<00:01:56.540> RD<00:01:57.540> project<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
quickly transition from an RD project to

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250 
quickly transition from an RD project to
full-blown<00:01:59.460> production<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.840> where<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> hundred

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
full-blown production to where a hundred

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.500 
full-blown production to where a hundred
percent<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.800> our<00:02:01.890> production<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:03.060> done<00:02:03.390> on

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
percent of our production now is done on

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.400 
percent of our production now is done on
printers<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.420> adding<00:02:06.420> 3d<00:02:06.690> printers<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.290> our

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
printers so adding 3d printers to our

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.249 
printers so adding 3d printers to our
production<00:02:07.860> process<00:02:08.509> means<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.110> can

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
production process means that we can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.760 
production process means that we can
easily<00:02:10.470> scale<00:02:11.070> up<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.790> easily<00:02:12.530> scale<00:02:13.530> with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
easily scale up we can easily scale with

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.180 
easily scale up we can easily scale with
the<00:02:13.920> demand<00:02:14.280> reach<00:02:14.820> more<00:02:15.120> doctors<00:02:16.190> deliver

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the demand reach more doctors deliver

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.860 
the demand reach more doctors deliver
them<00:02:17.400> faster<00:02:19.370> without<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.970> problems<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.660> had

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
them faster without the problems we had

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.800 
them faster without the problems we had
with<00:02:22.860> our<00:02:22.920> previous<00:02:23.489> processes<00:02:24.180> we're

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
with our previous processes we're

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.080 
with our previous processes we're
anticipating<00:02:25.220> getting<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.370> home<00:02:26.550> an<00:02:26.700> advantage

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
anticipating getting a home an advantage
