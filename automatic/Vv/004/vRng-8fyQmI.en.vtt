00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.009

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.139
 normal 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.339
 White bread! 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.970
 Japanese white bread 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.119
 Super delicious! 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.640
 No need to match anything 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.970
 I am so eating. 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.600
 Canadian white bread 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.380
 Also relatively hard 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.610
 taste very bad 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.510
 No smell 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900
 Also have no taste 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.350
 Overall, it is not good 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 Japanese white bread 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.480
 Very soft and tastes good 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.110
 Eat directly without any sauce 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 It’s delicious 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.030
 People who have been to Canada 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 Please tell me your thoughts 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850
 What do you think of Canadian white bread? 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 But the words of Canada 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.600
 Not only white bread, but also a lot of great bread 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.540
 This is great 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.910
 But if it is more than white bread 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.870
 Japan is a big win! 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.120
 White bread I am eating now 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.120
 It is produced by Yamazaki bread. 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 "soft white bread" 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.670
 Super ~ delicious! 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 It tastes like a cake 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 Scared when I first eat 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.680
 too delicious! 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.890
