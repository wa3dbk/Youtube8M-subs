faiths refer to and for them it's a very
very<00:01:35.250> important<00:01:35.700> sign<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> side<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
very important sign of the side of the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.359 
very important sign of the side of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
faith and so if you start talking about
making<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> illegal<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:40.140> are

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
making it illegal you then actually are

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.100 
making it illegal you then actually are
possibly<00:01:41.280> using<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.150> excuse<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> say

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
possibly using it as an excuse to say

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
possibly using it as an excuse to say
unpleasant<00:01:43.799> things<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> religious

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
minority which you I think much to be

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.740 
minority which you I think much to be
very<00:01:46.560> careful<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.549> answer<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.820> no<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
very careful of so my answer is no it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.420 
very careful of so my answer is no it
would<00:01:48.899> provide<00:01:49.259> huge<00:01:49.890> difficulties

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
would provide huge difficulties

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
would provide huge difficulties
conscient<00:01:50.880> conscientious<00:01:51.450> difficulties<00:01:51.960> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
conscient conscientious difficulties for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.990 
conscient conscientious difficulties for
Jews<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.530> Muslims<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.700> almost

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
Jews and Muslims it would almost

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
Jews and Muslims it would almost
certainly<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.540> unenforceable<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> would

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
certainly be unenforceable and it would

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
certainly be unenforceable and it would
take<00:01:55.680> away<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.640> very<00:01:56.790> important<00:01:57.390> the

it possible in a free society to make a

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.430 
it possible in a free society to make a

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
law of the kind which you require I

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.080 
law of the kind which you require I
think<00:07:34.500> there's<00:07:34.920> too<00:07:35.160> much<00:07:35.280> disagreement<00:07:35.850> and

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
think there's too much disagreement and

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.940 
think there's too much disagreement and
also<00:07:36.300> too<00:07:36.750> much<00:07:36.900> danger<00:07:37.200> of<00:07:37.470> what<00:07:37.650> might<00:07:37.920> turn

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
also too much danger of what might turn

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.860 
also too much danger of what might turn
out<00:07:38.220> to<00:07:38.400> be<00:07:38.550> covered<00:07:38.880> religious<00:07:39.270> persecution

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
out to be covered religious persecution

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.380 
out to be covered religious persecution
for<00:07:40.320> that<00:07:40.470> to<00:07:40.680> happen<00:07:40.860> you<00:07:41.460> may<00:07:41.700> well<00:07:42.000> say<00:07:42.360> that

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390 
for that to happen you may well say that

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.210 
for that to happen you may well say that
if<00:07:42.690> we<00:07:42.810> argue<00:07:42.960> about<00:07:43.110> this<00:07:43.440> long<00:07:43.680> enough<00:07:43.890> that

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
if we argue about this long enough that

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.310 
if we argue about this long enough that
it<00:07:44.340> the<00:07:44.730> demanders<00:07:45.300> and<00:07:45.419> Muslims<00:07:45.900> living<00:07:46.140> in

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.320 
it the demanders and Muslims living in

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.260 
it the demanders and Muslims living in
this<00:07:46.440> society<00:07:46.620> there<00:07:47.490> will<00:07:47.700> come<00:07:47.970> about<00:07:48.120> a

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270 
this society there will come about a

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.120 
this society there will come about a
movement<00:07:48.630> against<00:07:49.140> it<00:07:49.290> and<00:07:49.410> that<00:07:49.470> been<00:07:49.860> my

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130 
movement against it and that been my

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.560 
movement against it and that been my
view<00:07:50.190> might<00:07:50.460> not<00:07:50.610> be<00:07:50.760> a<00:07:50.790> terribly<00:07:51.090> bad<00:07:51.270> thing

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
view might not be a terribly bad thing

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.720 
view might not be a terribly bad thing
but<00:07:51.900> I<00:07:51.960> do<00:07:52.050> not<00:07:52.500> think<00:07:52.830> that<00:07:52.950> banning<00:07:53.460> it<00:07:53.550> by

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:53.730 
but I do not think that banning it by

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.580 
but I do not think that banning it by
law<00:07:54.030> would<00:07:54.570> achieve<00:07:54.930> that<00:07:55.169> or<00:07:55.200> bring<00:07:55.440> it

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:55.590 
law would achieve that or bring it

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.830 
law would achieve that or bring it
forward
