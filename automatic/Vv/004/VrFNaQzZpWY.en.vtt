mounting<00:00:10.740> some<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.450> SPS<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:14.030> now<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
mounting some of the SPS that I now to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.960 
mounting some of the SPS that I now to
extend<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> SPS<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> had<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.529> and

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970

I've had on these guys probably from the
s<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> LEDs<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.740> still<00:01:14.280> placing<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
s from the LEDs I'm still placing the

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.600 
s from the LEDs I'm still placing the
Idaho<00:01:16.439> no<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.560> flower<00:01:19.560> petal<00:01:20.040> Monty's

orange<00:01:25.080> Monte<00:01:25.439> cap<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:28.110> this

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
orange Monte cap right there and on this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.219 
orange Monte cap right there and on this
glass<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> Kenneth<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.479> small<00:01:33.840> frag

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
glass is Kenneth but on this small frag

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.340 
glass is Kenneth but on this small frag
or<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.890> small<00:01:35.250> piece<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.939> bird's<00:01:36.390> nest<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
or a small piece of the bird's nest you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
or a small piece of the bird's nest you
could<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.670> great

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
could see that there is also some great

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
could see that there is also some great
growth

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.760 

okay<00:01:44.510> even<00:01:45.510> far<00:01:45.840> away<00:01:46.110> from<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.650> could

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
okay even far away from here you could

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
okay even far away from here you could
see<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.700> lots<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.660> small<00:01:49.080> new

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
see if there's some lots of small new

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.040 
see if there's some lots of small new
growth<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.950> branches<00:01:50.400> she's<00:01:51.360> pretty<00:01:51.570> good

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.690 

yeah<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.080> guess<00:01:55.410> I'm<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.800> clean<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.130> glass<00:01:56.370> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
yeah I guess I'm so clean the glass so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600 
yeah I guess I'm so clean the glass so
it's<00:01:56.940> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.300> dirty<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.610> yeah

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it's kind of dirty a little but yeah

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
it's kind of dirty a little but yeah
just<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> quick<00:02:00.840> video<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.410> growth

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
just one quick video of these growth

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.320 
just one quick video of these growth
patterns<00:02:03.290> great<00:02:04.290> new<00:02:04.440> growth<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.160> mean<00:02:05.910> after

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
patterns great new growth I mean after

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.249 
patterns great new growth I mean after
just<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.920> weeks<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.700> three<00:02:08.970> weeks<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.300> think<00:02:09.540> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
just two weeks to three weeks I think of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
just two weeks to three weeks I think of
having<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:10.740> LEDs<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> still<00:02:11.700> acclimating

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
having these LEDs and still acclimating

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
having these LEDs and still acclimating
to<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.960> they're<00:02:13.200> already<00:02:13.380> starting<00:02:13.770> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to them and they're already starting to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
to them and they're already starting to
grow<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.430> ever<00:02:15.270> since<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.630> had<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> halides

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
grow and ever since I had the halides

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
grow and ever since I had the halides
they<00:02:16.470> never<00:02:16.800> showed<00:02:17.160> any<00:02:17.340> growth<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.880> much

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
they never showed any growth this much

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.000

that<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.090> he<00:02:42.270> has<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> branch<00:02:42.750> sticking<00:02:43.200> out

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
that but he has a branch sticking out

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.600 
that but he has a branch sticking out
now<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:43.860> good<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.920> over<00:02:46.920> here<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.580> have

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
now so that's good so over here we have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
now so that's good so over here we have
the<00:02:50.180> Red<00:02:51.180> Planet<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.019> we're<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:52.290> sticking<00:02:52.680> it

the Red Planet and we're not sticking it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650 
the Red Planet and we're not sticking it
right<00:02:52.980> here<00:02:53.190> doing<00:02:54.120> great

Rose Miller pora slightly encrusting
probably<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.709> can<00:03:04.800> see<00:03:05.130> over

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
probably on the back as you can see over

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.009 
probably on the back as you can see over
there<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.000> Red<00:03:06.269> Planet's<00:03:06.660> already

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
there on the Red Planet's already

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.820 
there on the Red Planet's already
starting<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.700> critten<00:03:09.320> crawling<00:03:10.320> down<00:03:10.470> the

starting to critten crawling down the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.670 
starting to critten crawling down the
skin<00:03:11.510> yeah

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
skin yeah

the<00:03:14.540> tricolor<00:03:15.560> slowly<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.250> said<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:18.060> you

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the tricolor slowly like I said as you

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
the tricolor slowly like I said as you
can<00:03:18.360> see<00:03:18.570> there's<00:03:18.750> already<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.260> little

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
can see there's already like this little

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.720 
can see there's already like this little
slant<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> skins<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.470> SPS<00:03:23.040> I'm<00:03:23.580> just

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
slant on the skins of the SPS I'm just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.380 
slant on the skins of the SPS I'm just
trying<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.030> crust<00:03:25.280> green<00:03:26.280> Slimer<00:03:26.580> still

trying to in crust green Slimer still
doing<00:03:28.260> good<00:03:28.440> encrusting<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.209> back<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
doing good encrusting on the back and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.729 
doing good encrusting on the back and
green<00:03:32.850> mili<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.660> see<00:03:33.900> there's<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.230> huge

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
green mili as you can see there's a huge

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.259 
green mili as you can see there's a huge
piece<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.070> skin<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.670> interesting<00:03:36.090> over

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
piece of skin that's interesting over

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.830 
piece of skin that's interesting over
there<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.370> also<00:03:38.820> have<00:03:39.120> another<00:03:39.480> piece<00:03:39.780> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
there and I also have another piece of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.140 
there and I also have another piece of
the<00:03:40.080> green<00:03:40.260> slammer<00:03:40.530> that's<00:03:40.769> over<00:03:40.980> here<00:03:41.280> I'm

the green slammer that's over here I'm

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
the green slammer that's over here I'm
temporarily<00:03:42.690> placing<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.799> if<00:03:43.860> they

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
temporarily placing it to see if they

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.920 
temporarily placing it to see if they
would<00:03:44.310> own

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
would own

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.890 
would own
grow<00:03:45.230> well<00:03:45.370> down<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.819> lower<00:03:47.030> areas<00:03:47.480> like<00:03:47.900> that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
grow well down in lower areas like that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.440 
grow well down in lower areas like that
but<00:03:50.900> yeah<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.079> just<00:03:51.140> want<00:03:51.439> to<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.829> made<00:03:52.819> a<00:03:53.090> quick

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
but yeah I just want to we made a quick

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.660 
but yeah I just want to we made a quick
video<00:03:53.959> showing<00:03:54.349> you<00:03:54.890> guys<00:03:55.099> these<00:03:55.459> new<00:03:56.120> growth

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
video showing you guys these new growth

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.240 
video showing you guys these new growth
changes<00:03:58.959> happening<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.140> SPS<00:04:00.620> from<00:04:01.099> the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
changes happening to the SPS from the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.750 
changes happening to the SPS from the
LEDs<00:04:01.609> probably<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.459> if<00:04:04.459> you're<00:04:04.609> thinking

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
LEDs probably so if you're thinking

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.429 
LEDs probably so if you're thinking
about<00:04:05.090> upgrading<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.629> LEDs<00:04:05.930> from<00:04:06.109> metal

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
about upgrading to LEDs from metal

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.559 
about upgrading to LEDs from metal
highlights<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:07.040> would<00:04:07.250> absolutely<00:04:07.790> recommend

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
highlights I would absolutely recommend

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.220 
highlights I would absolutely recommend
rapid<00:04:09.230> LED<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:10.819> 70<00:04:11.239> gallon<00:04:11.599> that's<00:04:11.870> this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
rapid LED for a 70 gallon that's this

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.539 
rapid LED for a 70 gallon that's this
deep<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.849> have<00:04:14.439> 39<00:04:15.439> LEDs<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:19.280> able<00:04:19.459> to

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
deep and have 39 LEDs and be able to

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.320 
deep and have 39 LEDs and be able to
grow<00:04:19.699> SPS<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:22.030> lot

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
grow SPS is a lot

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.900 
grow SPS is a lot
so<00:04:23.570> if<00:04:24.460> camera<00:04:25.460> has<00:04:25.580> colors<00:04:26.570> now<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:28.250> yeah<00:04:28.729> if

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
so if camera has colors now so yeah if

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.560 
so if camera has colors now so yeah if
you<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:30.280> yeah<00:04:31.310> LEDs<00:04:32.000> could<00:04:32.240> be<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.360> little

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
you have yeah LEDs could be a little

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.999 
you have yeah LEDs could be a little
pricey<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:33.080> in<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.320> end<00:04:33.440> they're<00:04:33.590> totally

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
pricey but in the end they're totally

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:34.600 
pricey but in the end they're totally
worth<00:04:34.190> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
worth it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.730 
worth it
so<00:04:35.389> I'm<00:04:35.509> just<00:04:35.660> waiting<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:36.410> wanted<00:04:36.680> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
make a quick video showing you the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
make a quick video showing you the
growth<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.530> whatnot<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.660> yeah<00:04:41.660> stay<00:04:42.590> tuned
