00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:16.810
 hello hello guys here we are one more day 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.960
 good kids in a boxing we put 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.110
 in the title the truth but good here 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.820
 I have a 3ds boxing if not of the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.519
 game is only worth what happens that good 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.320
 put the 3ds so that good people would 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.900
 the flash goes to see it looks good there 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.690
 you have the key friend is worth it 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.070
 someone wants to add me 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.290
 there are three of each friend as I put in the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.670
 title but all you add me 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.020
 please you have to warn me ok 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.210
 because if you do not already know that if I do not 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.910
 I put the code we also do nothing 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 good kids once 13 there is the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.039
 code that I'm showing it a 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.989
 so it's good to go with the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.820
 unboxing of this little gem that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.940
 just I took time for him to go 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.739
 for bread let him have a little 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.870
 she left a little bit of the eyelash here 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.330
 You see how you can see here a little 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 to not have to be there but good 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.260
 Let's go there 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.270
 We are going to open it, it's worth, I wanted to 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.870
 to have it the truth is that it takes a lot 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.910
 time waiting for what is the first what 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.980
 which is the first pokemon so in 3d we go 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.920
 to remove this plastic because 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.990
 you know that with one hand you already know a 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.250
 handyman is a bit complicated we are going to 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.810
 watch 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:36.350
 to see it that way and that's how it's good 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.600
 now here you have it great game 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.540
 my mother chose the x so if 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 someone has hiccups it's good they would have 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 a little bit of the same as without the code 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.930
 because the code as you can see is 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.979
 without scratching so it gives the same good for 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.680
 those who say that still not with 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.360
 instructions and put anything look mother 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.340
 mine of beautiful love good here you have 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.189
 the cartridge 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.679
 look what's coming moving notebooks and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.929
 everything and good guys can be pokemon and 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.069
 good the pokemon x sorry this is more 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.079
 that nothing for the people who have it 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.750
 that he knows that I have it in case he wants me 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.830
 add to the 3ds ok it's not that it's going to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.030
 be able to upload to the channel because 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.480
 originates all capturing of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.890
 not all capturing the 3ds so 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.380
 nothing good then guys this video 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.670
 I was just short to let you know what I'm going 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.440
 to say if I want to add here that I 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.900
 they put the comments or by private 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.780
 that they tell me or is not added the tome 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.910
 my pum code and I put it good and good 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.630
 We are going to go to 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.430
 behind 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.320
 I think they have little I think they have a 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.380
 cartridge placed and the console I think that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.060
 is the animal crossing over without looking at it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.470
 you see 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.209
 I had an animal crossing position now 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.630
 he actually takes it to me to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.260
 buying the little one has brought me good 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.910
 he takes it to me so that he takes it to me 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.150
 out there immediately the points that I have 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.580

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.500
