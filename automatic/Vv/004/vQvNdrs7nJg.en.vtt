raises this up a bit but this one was up
quite<00:00:14.280> high<00:00:14.309> because<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.299> lid<00:00:15.830> lid<00:00:16.830> piece

that's more than over a brass ring and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170 
that's more than over a brass ring and
then<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.740> brass<00:00:23.039> ring<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.369> fastened<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.019 
then the brass ring is fastened to the
floor<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.500> had<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.949> change<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> bolt<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
floor but I had to change the bolt so

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
floor but I had to change the bolt so
how<00:00:27.269> you've<00:00:27.449> changed<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> bolts<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.710> find

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
how you've changed the bolts as you find

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.769 
how you've changed the bolts as you find
that<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> wide<00:00:29.939> spot<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.390> here

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that there's a wide spot in here

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.279 
that there's a wide spot in here
somewhere

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
somewhere

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.790 
somewhere
and<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:32.730> gotta<00:00:32.969> find<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and you gotta find that and then the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
and you gotta find that and then the
boat<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.040> come<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.780> it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
boat will come out of there see it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.010 
boat will come out of there see it's
wider<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.680> than<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
wider there than it is in here so you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350 
wider there than it is in here so you
can<00:00:40.260> slip<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.829> there<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:42.030> turn<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
can slip it in there and then turn it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.310 
can slip it in there and then turn it
around<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.079> anything<00:00:43.620> spin<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.460> bold<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
around and anything spin that bold so it

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.160 
around and anything spin that bold so it
doesn't<00:00:46.770> doesn't<00:00:47.399> work<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.600> doesn't<00:00:48.840> turn

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
doesn't doesn't work that doesn't turn

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.639 
doesn't doesn't work that doesn't turn
when<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.850> passing<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.270> toilet<00:00:51.660> note<00:00:51.840> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
when you're passing the toilet note this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.130 
when you're passing the toilet note this
is<00:00:52.860> called<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> cab<00:00:53.520> week<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.989> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is called a cab week one because it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
is called a cab week one because it's
got<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.670> plastic<00:00:56.670> seal<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.570> there

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
got that little plastic seal in there

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.459 
got that little plastic seal in there
which<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.399> lower<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.469> then

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
which actually is lower than the then

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
which actually is lower than the then
they're<00:01:01.649> asked<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.340> we've<00:01:02.520> got<00:01:02.699> new

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
they're asked so now we've got new

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.539 
they're asked so now we've got new
toilet<00:01:03.420> bowls<00:01:03.660> old<00:01:04.379> ones<00:01:04.650> were<00:01:04.830> too<00:01:05.010> short<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
toilet bowls old ones were too short to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.740 
toilet bowls old ones were too short to
the<00:01:05.700> Abbot<00:01:06.439> 3/8<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.740> floor<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:11.750> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the Abbot 3/8 of floor on here and the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.300 
the Abbot 3/8 of floor on here and the
bolts<00:01:13.080> were<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.380> short<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
bolts were too short but I think the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.420 
bolts were too short but I think the
seal<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.790> fine<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.229> now<00:01:16.530> I'll<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.799> grab<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
seal is fine and now I'll just grab the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
seal is fine and now I'll just grab the
toilet<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.090> set<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> down<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> know

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
toilet and set it down on this you know

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.010 
toilet and set it down on this you know
I've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.650> new<00:01:19.799> bolts<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I've got new bolts in there and then I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.940 
I've got new bolts in there and then I
can<00:01:22.200> drop<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.479> into<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:27.650> into<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> lap

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
can drop down into the into the lap

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
can drop down into the into the lap
steel<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.799> hard<00:01:32.630> but

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
steel so it's not that hard but

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
steel so it's not that hard but
sometimes<00:01:34.200> after<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.009> tile<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> floor<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
sometimes after you tile the floor you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
sometimes after you tile the floor you
got<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> put<00:01:36.360> longer<00:01:36.659> bolts<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:38.280> you've

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
got to put longer bolts in and if you've

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
got to put longer bolts in and if you've
really<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.790> level<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> begin<00:01:42.390> with

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
really the thing was level to begin with

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.560 
really the thing was level to begin with
if<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.890> flange<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.610> loving<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> begin<00:01:45.360> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
if this flange was loving to begin with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.530 
if this flange was loving to begin with
you<00:01:45.810> may<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> add<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> piece<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> flange

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
you may have to add a piece of flange

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.190 
you may have to add a piece of flange
which<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.490> own<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.020> buy

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
which you can do this is own you can buy

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
which you can do this is own you can buy
the<00:01:52.259> flange<00:01:52.680> pieces<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.610> plumbing<00:01:53.939> supply

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the flange pieces at any plumbing supply

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.700 
the flange pieces at any plumbing supply
or<00:01:54.750> tile<00:01:55.110> supplying<00:01:55.649> yes

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.499 

so<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.859> back<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.130> installing<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.999> toilet

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so I'm back to installing this toilet

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
so I'm back to installing this toilet
again<00:02:03.630> after<00:02:04.200> putting<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> thicker

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
again after putting all the thicker

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.750 
again after putting all the thicker
tiles<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.240> floor<00:02:07.039> we<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:10.110> longer

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
tiles on the floor we had to have longer

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.789 
tiles on the floor we had to have longer
longer<00:02:11.760> bunks<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.690> toilet<00:02:12.959> which<00:02:13.590> we

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
longer bunks for the toilet which we

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.580 
longer bunks for the toilet which we
didn't<00:02:14.099> before<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.510> also<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.410> too

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
didn't before but now also this is too

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.920 
didn't before but now also this is too
short<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.129> supply<00:02:17.519> pipe<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.030> too<00:02:18.239> short<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
short the supply pipe is too short so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.500 
short the supply pipe is too short so
the<00:02:19.680> best<00:02:19.890> thing<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.640> replace<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.299> but

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
