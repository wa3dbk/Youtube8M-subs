00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 I washed the field I think it's really cool 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.910
 so this is the appreciation that fans have with 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 the voice of the characters is a business that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.810
 Do you like Brazil ? 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.620

 Gifts is a business 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 curious but I understand well because when 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.910
 a child voice actor met mister 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.469

 the day he made the voice is my self 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 I felt a business that reminds me until today. 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 comes to me how did you discover which 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 You made it cooler and that changed that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 simply something that was created was 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.330
 making a character that you really 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 I loved the first job I did. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.090

 proof of all I love doing I 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.429
 do another job that is great that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.159
 I like that I double the ballast that is the 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.899
 that boss was half-talkative at first 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.149
 now he's going to grow it up to me 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.390
 I did not like him because I spoke in the cemit 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.519
 his is his but after seeing that it is a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.220
 his manner because he has a 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.530
 nice side so to say but it's you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.840
 assists the guy there he's kind of arrogant 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.549
 and must always have a leaning to 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.739
 an arrogant business, too. 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.230
 times because you have to get into the 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.260
 spirit of the guy to come to seem 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.840
 What sound is coming out of the face? 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.579

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.590
 You knew better I dubbed uvaia gosslin o 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.739
 Diary of a legal passion you can 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.450
 speak with 11 rebounds 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.269
 You 're different too, but one 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.090
 The Twilight itself is one thing. 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.709
 staff charges very critical very play 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.290
 much and such that you think people 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.100
 learn a little there how does the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.200
 craft and I think it's good that you 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.420

 here we have the time code that is in the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.990
