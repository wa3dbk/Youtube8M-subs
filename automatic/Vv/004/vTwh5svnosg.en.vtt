00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there I'm drawing the hilt of the sword

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.640 
there I'm drawing the hilt of the sword
and<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> handle<00:01:12.390> coming<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.530> like

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and the handle coming down just like

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.260 
and the handle coming down just like
that<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:16.220> sword<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.580> probably<00:01:18.060> come

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that and the sword would probably come

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
that and the sword would probably come
out<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:22.400> would<00:01:23.400> say<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> sword

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
out to about there I would say the sword

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
out to about there I would say the sword
is<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.210> much<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> part<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> outfit<00:01:25.860> as

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
is very much a part of the outfit as

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.770 
is very much a part of the outfit as
well<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> reason<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.210> drew<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well now the reason I drew just kind of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
well now the reason I drew just kind of
a<00:01:27.900> hooded<00:01:28.080> shape<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.130> to

going to be a whole lot of color on them

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.320 
going to be a whole lot of color on them
because<00:02:51.489> ninjas<00:02:51.850> are<00:02:51.940> supposed<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.180> be

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
because ninjas are supposed to be

because ninjas are supposed to be
relatively<00:02:53.519> silent<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.910> invisible<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
relatively silent and invisible so

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.630 
relatively silent and invisible so

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
there's not a whole lot of color or

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640 
there's not a whole lot of color or
detail<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.599> this<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.959> what<00:02:59.110> capturing<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
detail but this is what capturing the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.380 
detail but this is what capturing the
pose<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.280> really<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.640> most<00:03:00.790> important<00:03:01.269> thing

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
pose is really the most important thing

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
pose is really the most important thing
to<00:03:01.480> do<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:03.180> most<00:03:04.180> important<00:03:04.690> step<00:03:04.930> by<00:03:05.110> far

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
to do and the most important step by far

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.190 
to do and the most important step by far
when<00:03:05.769> you're<00:03:05.920> learning<00:03:06.010> how<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.340> draw<00:03:07.200> clothes

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
when you're learning how to draw clothes

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.000 
when you're learning how to draw clothes
for<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> ninja<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.480> once<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.530> basically

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
for a ninja and so once you basically

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.880 
for a ninja and so once you basically
once<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.730> have<00:03:12.849> that<00:03:13.060> down<00:03:13.680> you've<00:03:14.680> pretty

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
once you have that down you've pretty

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.430 
once you have that down you've pretty
much<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.130> it
