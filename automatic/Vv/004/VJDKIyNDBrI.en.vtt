Todd it's this is this cheeky one my but
my<00:02:36.000> thing<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.170> might<00:02:38.040> add<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
my thing I might add that I think the

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.759 
my thing I might add that I think the
grossest<00:02:40.250> might<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.260> don't<00:02:43.500> we

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
grossest might be this one we don't we

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.009 
grossest might be this one we don't we
know<00:02:44.100> what<00:02:44.280> those<00:02:44.459> things<00:02:44.940> are<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.540> there's

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
know what those things are but there's

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.570 
know what those things are but there's
bugs<00:02:46.350> eating<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.980> waffles

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.360 

it's<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.330> easy<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.960> follow<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:53.070> that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's very easy to follow I think that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.790 
it's very easy to follow I think that
children<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:54.030> three<00:02:54.450> quite<00:02:55.080> easily<00:02:55.290> pick<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
children of three quite easily pick it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.710 
children of three quite easily pick it
up<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.220> would<00:02:56.550> be<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.880> bit<00:02:57.030> concerned<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
up I would be a bit concerned that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.870 
up I would be a bit concerned that
children<00:02:57.840> who<00:02:58.440> were<00:02:58.590> maybe<00:02:58.770> ten<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.610> that's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
children who were maybe ten and that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120 
children who were maybe ten and that's
the<00:03:00.180> age<00:03:00.450> range<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> box<00:03:01.530> was<00:03:01.680> three<00:03:01.710> to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
the age range on the box was three to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.130 
the age range on the box was three to
ten<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.030> might<00:03:03.240> be<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> little<00:03:03.630> bit<00:03:03.840> boring

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
ten that it might be a little bit boring

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.740 
ten that it might be a little bit boring
for<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.610> pictures<00:03:06.120> are<00:03:06.270> really<00:03:06.390> great

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
for them the pictures are really great

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.450 
for them the pictures are really great
they're<00:03:06.960> great<00:03:07.230> fun<00:03:07.440> we've<00:03:07.680> been<00:03:07.860> trying<00:03:08.400> to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
they're great fun we've been trying to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.490 
they're great fun we've been trying to
work<00:03:08.580> out<00:03:08.820> what<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.360> these<00:03:09.480> bugs<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:10.200> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
work out what some of these bugs are and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
work out what some of these bugs are and
making<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.310> our<00:03:11.490> names<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:12.120> special<00:03:12.480> drinks

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
making up our names for special drinks

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.500 
making up our names for special drinks
like<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> froggy<00:03:13.500> drink<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:15.090> we've<00:03:15.360> enjoyed

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
like the froggy drink and we've enjoyed

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.010 
like the froggy drink and we've enjoyed
playing<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:17.330> don't<00:03:18.330> think<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.600> would<00:03:18.810> want

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
playing it I don't think you would want

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.430 
playing it I don't think you would want
to<00:03:19.140> play<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.380> too<00:03:19.680> often<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.840> 9-pound<00:03:21.840> fifty

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to play it too often and 9-pound fifty

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.250 
to play it too often and 9-pound fifty
we<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.800> think<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.370> little<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.790> expensive

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
we do think it's a little bit expensive

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.780 
we do think it's a little bit expensive
because<00:03:25.260> an<00:03:25.560> average<00:03:25.680> game<00:03:26.190> lasts<00:03:26.550> between

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
because an average game lasts between

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.510 
because an average game lasts between
three<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.540> four<00:03:27.810> minutes<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.680> that's<00:03:29.280> our

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
three to four minutes and that's our

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.310 
three to four minutes and that's our
review<00:03:29.700> for<00:03:30.150> Izzy<00:03:30.330> Lizzie<00:03:30.450> kids<00:03:30.840> thank<00:03:31.260> you
