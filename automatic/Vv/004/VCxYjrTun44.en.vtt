heartbeat sensor and I know people think

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.919 
heartbeat sensor and I know people think
that's<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.340> noobish<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.509> tues<00:00:12.750> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929

just because it might not give me a
physical<00:00:14.670> boost<00:00:15.210> why<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.660> will<00:00:15.960> give<00:00:16.170> me<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
