00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
best thing so if you don't know what

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.350 
best thing so if you don't know what
synchronize<00:01:26.159> does<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.640> another<00:01:26.880> pokemon

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
synchronize does if another pokemon

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
synchronize does if another pokemon
burns<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.900> poison<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.650> paralyzes<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
burns you poison to you or paralyzes you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
burns you poison to you or paralyzes you
the<00:01:30.119> pokemon<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:30.990> gets<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> status<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the pokemon also gets the status so it's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
the pokemon also gets the status so it's

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
gonna be a tank and the last thing you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.700 
gonna be a tank and the last thing you
want<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.950> give<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.570> 252<00:02:44.570> speed<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.440> you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
want to give it is 252 speed because you

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.230 
want to give it is 252 speed because you
really<00:02:46.010> want<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.220> help<00:02:46.280> speed<00:02:46.550> certain<00:02:47.000> things

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
really want to help speed certain things

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.480 
really want to help speed certain things
and<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.350> bad<00:02:48.530> idea<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.890> run<00:02:48.980> an<00:02:49.190> Umbreon

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
and it's a bad idea to run an Umbreon

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.490 
and it's a bad idea to run an Umbreon
with<00:02:49.700> no<00:02:49.910> speed<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.870> has<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> really

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
with no speed because it has a really

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.700 
with no speed because it has a really
bad<00:02:51.650> speed<00:02:52.010> base<00:02:52.310> 65<00:02:52.930> euro<00:02:53.930> Vette<00:02:54.170> speed<00:02:54.440> isn't

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
bad speed base 65 euro Vette speed isn't

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.040 
bad speed base 65 euro Vette speed isn't
good<00:02:55.130> now<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.490> attack<00:02:56.060> isn't<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.930> know

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
good now the attack isn't you know

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.110 
good now the attack isn't you know
Umbreon<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.770> isn't<00:02:58.010> an<00:02:58.340> attacker<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.030> it

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
Umbreon really isn't an attacker but it

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.090 
Umbreon really isn't an attacker but it
does<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.450> an<00:02:59.540> attacking<00:02:59.840> move<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.500> I'm

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
does have an attacking move and I'm

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.350 
does have an attacking move and I'm
gonna<00:03:01.190> explain<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.730> real<00:03:01.910> quick<00:03:02.150> right<00:03:02.300> now

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
let's go over the move step so Umbreon

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.940 
let's go over the move step so Umbreon
is<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> wall<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.780> tank<00:03:06.020> it's<00:03:06.230> taller<00:03:06.620> and

it's practically the perfect stall in my

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.650 
it's practically the perfect stall in my
opinion<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.940> course<00:03:11.210> you're<00:03:11.330> gonna<00:03:11.420> want

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
opinion and of course you're gonna want

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.160 
opinion and of course you're gonna want
to<00:03:11.720> run<00:03:11.810> toxic<00:03:12.410> because<00:03:13.160> because<00:03:14.080> after<00:03:15.080> you

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
to run toxic because because after you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.720
