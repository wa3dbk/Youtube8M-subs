00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 yes 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.320
 hello hello is that the Italian is like 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.820
 you are well you are prepared so that 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.890
 I taught you the new line of enamels 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.130
 special to stamp that has taken 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.750
 by predictor all colors work 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.579
 great and have a good time 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.789
 dried though I would have liked the 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.980
 white would have been a little more white 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.760
 and enough of chatter let's see what 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.620
 it's coming one by one 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.100
 let's start by stamping with the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 creamy 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.600
 I do not like it much, throw a little in 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.600
 around coral 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.140
 he had liked to be more special 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.530
 because they do the movie very well for 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.530
 to stamp 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.000
 Y 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.070
 these containers are 6 milliliters have 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.590
 a unique size because you already know that the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.630
 Enamels for printing are much more 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.850
 thicker than regular ones and if not 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 we give a lot of use it can be that when 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 go to march the hand and we need 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 and they are not as we would like 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.899
 and now it's the turn of the colors 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.899
 metallic 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.890
 the metallic colors will be much more 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.890
 fast than the creamy ones 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.960
 of the six colors the one that has most 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 liked to write the golden ones 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.850
 is beautiful 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.670
 I love this motto paints gravel 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.490
 yes 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.740
 and to finish I'll leave you an idea 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.780
 what happens if you mix the creamy colors 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.780
 with metallized we will see 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.409
 we mix very well 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.550
 Y 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 and we get the same color but with a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 metallic effect 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.940
 I do not know if you can appreciate if the reflection 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.940
 but good on the nail yes it looks 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.050
 and with these tuesdays we are ready 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.870
 to give envy tell me what it is that I 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.290
 the stylist liked it of course 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.629
 this good then do not forget ld is 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.810
 up like that and I enjoyed it very much 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.810
 all right
