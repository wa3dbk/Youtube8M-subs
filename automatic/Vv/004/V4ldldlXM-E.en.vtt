00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
my thought on now make sure one of the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.820 
my thought on now make sure one of the

something somewhere yep yep the smallest

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.250 
something somewhere yep yep the smallest
one<00:03:38.010> goes<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.030> left<00:03:39.269> hand<00:03:39.480> side<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.799> I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
one goes on the left hand side so I

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.090 
one goes on the left hand side so I
slide<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:45.500> yet<00:03:46.500> again<00:03:46.620> there's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
slide it in there and yet again there's

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.970 
slide it in there and yet again there's
another<00:03:47.340> dent<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.910> there<00:03:48.380> where<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> goes

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
another dent in there where that goes

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.890 
another dent in there where that goes
I'm<00:03:50.790> going<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.709> push<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.859> all<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.010> way<00:03:53.130> up<00:03:53.900> lock

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
I'm going to push it all the way up lock

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.789 
I'm going to push it all the way up lock
that<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.680> locks<00:03:58.799> into<00:03:59.099> place<00:03:59.310> and<00:04:00.060> then

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
that on so it locks into place and then

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.920 
that on so it locks into place and then
lock<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:02.180> then<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.329> can<00:04:03.359> fiddle<00:04:03.720> around

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
lock that then you can fiddle around

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.409 
lock that then you can fiddle around
with<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.680> make<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:07.010> go<00:04:08.010> with<00:04:08.669> what<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:08.970> want

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the angle to be 2nd Ward is your back

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.520 
the angle to be 2nd Ward is your back
Mick<00:04:13.079> me<00:04:13.290> Tom<00:04:13.910> yeah<00:04:15.709> go<00:04:16.709> again<00:04:16.979> same<00:04:17.489> applies

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
Mick me Tom yeah go again same applies

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.560 
Mick me Tom yeah go again same applies
nice<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.310> move<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.120> time<00:04:24.330> out<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
nice in like that move that time out the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:37.640 
nice in like that move that time out the
way<00:04:25.789> look<00:04:31.340> ok<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:34.010> then<00:04:35.360> my<00:04:36.360> base<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.229> bit

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
way look ok and then my base is a bit

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.460 
way look ok and then my base is a bit
over<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:38.849> you<00:04:38.910> want<00:04:39.210> room<00:04:39.599> for<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:39.990> Tom's

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
over so you want room for you to Tom's

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.860 
over so you want room for you to Tom's
so<00:04:41.280> if<00:04:41.400> my<00:04:41.550> base<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.789> over<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.479> means<00:04:42.690> my

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
so if my base is over that means my

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.610 
so if my base is over that means my
whole<00:04:43.370> drum<00:04:44.370> kit<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.760> in<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.120> wrong<00:04:45.270> place

whole drum kit is in the wrong place

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.490 
whole drum kit is in the wrong place
