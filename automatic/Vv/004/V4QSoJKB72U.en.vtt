couple hours in water and the bed you
see<00:00:43.450> behind<00:00:43.570> me<00:00:43.809> is<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.230> bed<00:00:44.499> that<00:00:44.530> constructed

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
see behind me is a bed that constructed

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.630 
see behind me is a bed that constructed
off<00:00:45.999> camera<00:00:46.690> because<00:00:47.289> my<00:00:48.070> carpentry<00:00:48.519> skills

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
off camera because my carpentry skills

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.549 
off camera because my carpentry skills
are<00:00:49.269> not<00:00:49.390> something<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.749> I<00:00:49.870> really<00:00:49.960> tend<00:00:50.499> to

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
are not something that I really tend to

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.559 
are not something that I really tend to
bring<00:00:50.739> on<00:00:50.890> camera<00:00:51.249> because<00:00:51.370> there<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:52.420> job

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
bring on camera because there the job

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.939 
bring on camera because there the job
usually<00:00:52.780> ends<00:00:53.109> up<00:00:53.170> getting<00:00:53.260> done<00:00:53.589> but<00:00:53.800> it's

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
usually ends up getting done but it's

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.709 
usually ends up getting done but it's
nothing<00:00:54.249> that<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.399> really<00:00:54.819> prefer<00:00:55.210> showing

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
nothing that I really prefer showing

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.029 
nothing that I really prefer showing
because<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:56.289> kind<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.499> embarrassing<00:00:56.649> at

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
because it's kind of embarrassing at

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.369

white<00:03:34.710> pine<00:03:35.040> I'm<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.150> worried<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:36.510> it's<00:03:36.600> going

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
white pine I'm not worried if it's going

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.150 
white pine I'm not worried if it's going
to<00:03:36.780> rot<00:03:36.960> out<00:03:36.990> or<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.680> needs<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.920> hold

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
to rot out or not it just needs to hold

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.370 
to rot out or not it just needs to hold
wood<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.090> stuff<00:03:39.300> at<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.450> old<00:03:39.630> house<00:03:39.810> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
wood and the stuff at the old house it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.160 
wood and the stuff at the old house it
stayed<00:03:40.800> pretty<00:03:41.370> good<00:03:41.610> for<00:03:41.910> four<00:03:42.420> seasons<00:03:42.960> and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
stayed pretty good for four seasons and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.290 
stayed pretty good for four seasons and
once<00:03:44.100> we<00:03:44.280> sold<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.580> house<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.910> was<00:03:45.000> still

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
once we sold the house it was still

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.410 
once we sold the house it was still
going<00:03:45.750> strong<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.590> use<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.490> same<00:03:47.760> wood<00:03:48.000> that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
going strong so I use the same wood that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.790 
going strong so I use the same wood that
I<00:03:48.480> did<00:03:48.660> at<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.780> old<00:03:48.960> house<00:03:49.110> for<00:03:49.380> these<00:03:49.530> beds

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
I did at the old house for these beds

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.010 
I did at the old house for these beds
then<00:03:50.550> my<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.060> mixture<00:03:51.360> like<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.600> said<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> just

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
then my the mixture like I said is just

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.860 
then my the mixture like I said is just
one<00:03:52.200> bag<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.830> part<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.550> Lambert<00:03:54.000> peat

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
one bag one part of the Lambert peat

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.270 
one bag one part of the Lambert peat
moss<00:03:55.020> -<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.710> part<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.720> composted<00:03:57.720> peat

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
moss - one part of the composted peat

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.840 
moss - one part of the composted peat
and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.980> dimensions<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> bed<00:04:02.370> which

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
and then the dimensions of the bed which

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.400 
and then the dimensions of the bed which
I<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.240> to<00:04:03.330> get<00:04:03.480> our<00:04:03.720> four<00:04:04.170> feet

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
I know I'm going to get our four feet

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
I know I'm going to get our four feet
basically<00:04:05.340> four<00:04:05.730> feet<00:04:05.940> wide<00:04:06.560> by<00:04:07.560> 24<00:04:08.520> feet<00:04:08.940> long

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
basically four feet wide by 24 feet long

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.740 
basically four feet wide by 24 feet long
this<00:04:11.430> Wynn<00:04:11.640> hates<00:04:11.880> me

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
this Wynn hates me

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.830 
this Wynn hates me
so<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.620> boards<00:04:13.920> we<00:04:14.040> used<00:04:14.310> were<00:04:14.910> two<00:04:15.150> by<00:04:15.330> sixes

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
so the boards we used were two by sixes

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.810 
so the boards we used were two by sixes
the<00:04:16.320> reason<00:04:16.530> why<00:04:16.590> we<00:04:16.739> used<00:04:16.890> two<00:04:17.010> by<00:04:17.160> sixes<00:04:17.609> is

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the reason why we used two by sixes is

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.849 
the reason why we used two by sixes is
because<00:04:18.239> we<00:04:18.930> already<00:04:19.080> had<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.470> really<00:04:19.739> good

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
because we already had the really good

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.490 
because we already had the really good
soil<00:04:20.100> underneath<00:04:20.400> had<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.419> had<00:04:21.690> really<00:04:22.290> hard

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
soil underneath had we had really hard

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.800 
soil underneath had we had really hard
clay<00:04:22.800> soil<00:04:23.130> or<00:04:23.490> been<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.390> raised<00:04:24.660> bed

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
clay soil or been in like a raised bed

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.200 
clay soil or been in like a raised bed
situation<00:04:25.650> right<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:25.980> grass<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.970> would<00:04:27.120> have

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
situation right on grass we would have

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.810 
situation right on grass we would have
used<00:04:27.360> two<00:04:27.540> by<00:04:27.690> twelves<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:29.070> 12<00:04:29.460> inches<00:04:29.760> deep

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
used two by twelves so 12 inches deep

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.550 
used two by twelves so 12 inches deep
these<00:04:30.180> are<00:04:30.330> only<00:04:30.510> six<00:04:30.780> inches<00:04:30.960> deep<00:04:31.200> because

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
these are only six inches deep because

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.730 
these are only six inches deep because
once<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.190> once<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.390> roots<00:04:33.840> sense<00:04:34.500> that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
once the once the the roots sense that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.870 
once the once the the roots sense that
there's<00:04:34.919> something<00:04:35.160> else<00:04:35.400> down<00:04:35.640> there

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
there's something else down there

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.400 
there's something else down there
they're<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> go<00:04:36.570> down<00:04:36.750> into<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.230> soil

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
they're going to go down into the soil

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.110 
they're going to go down into the soil
that's<00:04:37.650> already<00:04:37.890> loose<00:04:38.190> very<00:04:38.550> fertile<00:04:38.970> and

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
that's already loose very fertile and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.750 
that's already loose very fertile and
they're<00:04:39.630> going<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> go<00:04:39.900> pretty<00:04:40.110> great<00:04:40.760> also

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
they're going to go pretty great also

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.630 
they're going to go pretty great also
we've<00:04:42.150> amended<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:43.110> bed<00:04:43.470> with<00:04:43.710> some<00:04:43.919> trifecta

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
we've amended the bed with some trifecta

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.260 
we've amended the bed with some trifecta
and<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:46.290> some<00:04:46.470> extra<00:04:47.400> blood<00:04:47.610> meal<00:04:47.850> because

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
and just some extra blood meal because

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.200 
and just some extra blood meal because
they<00:04:49.200> are<00:04:49.350> really<00:04:50.100> heavy<00:04:50.280> nitrogen<00:04:50.580> feeders

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
they are really heavy nitrogen feeders

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.000 
they are really heavy nitrogen feeders
and<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.140> wanted<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.590> make<00:04:52.710> sure<00:04:52.740> there<00:04:52.919> was

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and so I wanted to make sure there was

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.710 
and so I wanted to make sure there was
enough<00:04:53.220> nitrogen<00:04:53.760> in<00:04:53.880> there<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.300> really

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
enough nitrogen in there so I really

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.770 
enough nitrogen in there so I really
packed<00:04:55.110> in<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.380> nitrogen<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:57.660> was

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
packed in the nitrogen and that was

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.420 
packed in the nitrogen and that was
about<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.960> I'm<00:04:58.530> gonna<00:04:58.680> give<00:04:58.860> them<00:04:58.950> some<00:04:59.160> water

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
about it I'm gonna give them some water

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.350 
about it I'm gonna give them some water
