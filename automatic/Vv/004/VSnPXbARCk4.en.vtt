00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.430

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 I'll start with my hair like this 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 remembering that my hair here is a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 third of a twist out or 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 be twists texturing you will 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.760
 need any elastic 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 hair and only one clip but wait 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.080
 there is something missing 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.180
 Aja I know it is but I watched orenes kitten 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.820

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.540
 in the sun you hair that is also 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 pretty 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:25.110
 but the hairstyle that I'm going to teach for 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.360
 Are you for parties or special events? 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 starting in the front I'll separate my 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 to the media 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 you can separate the size of the strip 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.380
 that you want 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.070
 after that I'm going to get all the hair that I 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:59.580
 left and I'm going to pull it up as if 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:02:01.590
 I had an athlete done for later 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.180
 do not have my las type of hair 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 to do such an act but the only one 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.030
 difference is that I'm going to pull it all over 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.030
 up 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 I tie a knot in the back and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.640
 I wake up thinking this new self 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.950
 I'm pulling the rubber band up doing 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.500
 a radius to be proposed in your field is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.900
 right on top you set him on the side that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.330
 You want me to put it on 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 side but if you want you can leave it 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.810
 in the middle 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.640
 after that, just take one more turn with 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:01.090
 elastic bandage and excess elastic 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.970
 threading under so much hair when 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:10.150
 You finish is just straightening to your liking. 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.730
 gives more uni or leave anyway this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.350
 part here is optional but to give us 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
 complements my fringe 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.750
 I'm going to separate a fuse under the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.590
 my fringe and I'm going to put the 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.590
 root of my hair 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.819

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.819
 five minutes 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:55.459
 You can use the hairstyle like this or 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.830

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.500

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.170
 big inside my hair and I'm going 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.850

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.850
