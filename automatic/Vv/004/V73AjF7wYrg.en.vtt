00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.180 

okay<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.780> cut<00:00:07.080> through<00:00:07.290> until<00:00:07.590> that<00:00:07.770> tree<00:00:08.010> was

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
okay I cut through until that tree was

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay I cut through until that tree was
just<00:00:08.460> ready<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.120> release<00:00:09.420> but<00:00:09.720> it's<00:00:10.110> not

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
just ready to release but it's not

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650 
just ready to release but it's not
releasing<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:10.980> its<00:00:11.130> own<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.940> wants<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.300> go<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
releasing on its own it wants to go that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270 
releasing on its own it wants to go that
way<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> gap<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> still

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
way but you can see the gap is still

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.510 
way but you can see the gap is still
open<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.080> that's<00:00:16.080> great<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:16.920> what<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.160> want

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
open so that's great that's what I want

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.100 
open so that's great that's what I want
I<00:00:17.670> want<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> enough<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.450> that<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.810> pull<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
I want it enough so that I can pull it

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.890 
I want it enough so that I can pull it
down<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.860> not<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.280> much<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.940> is<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
down but not so much that it is going to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
down but not so much that it is going to
fall<00:00:22.140> back<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.400> too

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
fall back in here because then it's too

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.669 
fall back in here because then it's too
loose<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> pull<00:00:24.929> it<00:00:24.960> over<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.500> going

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
loose and when I pull it over I'm going

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.609 
loose and when I pull it over I'm going
to<00:00:25.740> rip<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.640> bark<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.929> other<00:00:28.080> thing<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.410> did

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
to rip that bark the other thing I did

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
to rip that bark the other thing I did
this<00:00:28.830> case<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.339> cut<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:29.699> above<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> knot

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
this case is cut right above a knot

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640 
this case is cut right above a knot
that's<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> help<00:00:30.869> hold<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> together<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that's going to help hold it together a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.570 
that's going to help hold it together a
little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.770> I'm<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> try<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.310> land

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
little bit and I'm going to try to land

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.370 
little bit and I'm going to try to land
it<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.060> tree<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.330> might<00:00:36.600> wreck<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.080> tree

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it on this tree I might wreck this tree

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.209 
it on this tree I might wreck this tree
but<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:39.329> cushion<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> blow<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> larger

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
but I'll cushion the blow of this larger

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
but I'll cushion the blow of this larger
tree<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.640> doing<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.020> don't<00:00:43.649> cut<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.039> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
tree by doing it so I don't cut all the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
tree by doing it so I don't cut all the
way<00:00:44.280> through<00:00:44.850> until<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> tree<00:00:45.539> releases<00:00:46.230> on

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
way through until the tree releases on

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.270 
way through until the tree releases on
its<00:00:46.500> own<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.430> always<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> case<00:00:47.969> but

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
its own that's not always the case but

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.099 
its own that's not always the case but
if<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.699> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.180> preserve<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.840> tree

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
if I want to really preserve this tree

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.490 
if I want to really preserve this tree
that's<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> case<00:00:53.989> because<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that's the case because I want it to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.599 
that's the case because I want it to
slow<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.489> fall<00:00:56.699> slowly<00:01:00.800> I'm<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.100> rocking<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
slow to fall slowly I'm just rocking it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.230 
slow to fall slowly I'm just rocking it
a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:07.220> like<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> brushing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a little bit I like that it's brushing

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.230 
a little bit I like that it's brushing
through<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.660> other<00:01:10.500> tree<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:12.030> here

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
through that other tree there from here

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.390 
through that other tree there from here
on<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> come<00:01:12.930> down<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.320> hard

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.429 

this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> perfect<00:01:24.030> hinge<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> maple

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this is a perfect hinge this is a maple

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.850 
this is a perfect hinge this is a maple
tree<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> 20s<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.740> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tree it's in the 20s out here this is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.120 
tree it's in the 20s out here this is
going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> survive<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.650> brushed<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.920> down

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
going to survive I brushed it down

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.420 
going to survive I brushed it down
against<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.670> other<00:01:32.880> trees<00:01:33.240> softly<00:01:34.250> see<00:01:35.250> how

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
against those other trees softly see how

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
against those other trees softly see how
slowly<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.970> came<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.810> stopped<00:01:37.259> was

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
slowly it came down it stopped was

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
slowly it came down it stopped was
brushing<00:01:37.950> against<00:01:38.369> other<00:01:38.520> trees<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.000> cannot

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
brushing against other trees I cannot

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
brushing against other trees I cannot
tell<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.689> how<00:01:39.840> important<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
tell you how important that is if this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010 
tell you how important that is if this
thing<00:01:41.340> came<00:01:41.700> crashing<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> stopped

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
thing came crashing down and it stopped

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
thing came crashing down and it stopped
hit<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> ground<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.220> might<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.549> shattered

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
hit the ground it might have shattered

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.569 
hit the ground it might have shattered
this<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.130> didn't<00:01:47.430> split

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
this the other thing is it didn't split

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
this the other thing is it didn't split
down<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.090> way<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> kept<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> high<00:01:49.380> enough<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
down this way I kept it high enough so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.670 
down this way I kept it high enough so
deer<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.219> walk<00:01:50.369> under<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.820> by<00:01:51.659> cutting<00:01:52.530> right

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
deer can walk under it by cutting right

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
deer can walk under it by cutting right
above<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> knot<00:01:53.219> here<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
above a knot here it's not going to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
above a knot here it's not going to
split<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.719> through<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.079> knot<00:01:55.320> instead<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
split down through that knot instead it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.149 
split down through that knot instead it
split<00:01:56.759> upwards
