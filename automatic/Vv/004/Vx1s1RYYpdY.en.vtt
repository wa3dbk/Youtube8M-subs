00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 premature thomas listen gervinho is 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.210
 the coach of the nigeria team has 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.380
 not fail to Tunisia I was less 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.380
 well not the ointment or tunisia 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.560
 I do not use and they have 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.900
 young people 6,7 and things so here I have 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.230
 then we have so much to do well 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.230
 has so much 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.200
 we really want to win this match 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.540
 the bottles to this thing who who him 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.560
 I do not know so here and want to you 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.690
 did it well I think what to do 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.790
 we missed out on luck you did not 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 only one thing in mind was 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.830
 win this match 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.230
 this is it was not tonight I 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.660
 think that there are no excuses for 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.280
 give to you is that we and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.720
 was not good and so here and I 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.580
 think we've all gone by because 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.440
 we did not win but all told 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.239
 serve as the flood of oise at the bottom there 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.270
 is very strong but I still 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 trust to thwart you have 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.619
 surely with determination with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.250
 a lot of mind a lot of these pacs 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.540
 what I say but with a lot of 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 respect with the kids and evolve towards 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.640
 nancy we beat well 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.920
 god listened to me my retired nagra 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.530
 is total at the game jason terry 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.340
 that's why they have a year there the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.600
 best team won 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.920
 but OK 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.909
 our side we reverse beast in 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.069
 question because that's so since 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.240
 it's impossible to win at the same time 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.030
 his master in question what is that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.340
 that's the best thing 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 way motorcycle after doing too much hope there 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.650
 that there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.650
 we get to work 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.939
 had presented a face and that this 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.359
 year it's a game a little bit 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.359
 complicated 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.380
 and both teams and not 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.369
 only 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.369
 gave everything we had in the belly 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.680
 you're a little luck we had a purpose 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.920
 against the course of the game 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.470
 this is sport football 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.600
 a match like that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.500
 from a cell phone I already decided that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.500
 on the ones you see so 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.130
 positively the advances already do not 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.860
 well back in the match we did not 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.480
 play 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.330
 if our usual qualities ie 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.370
 play shot in the intervals gone 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.410
 to hit because that's our rating 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.970
 eyes and I think we used a lot of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.710
 long balloons and when you play against 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.110
 a team as powerful as that of 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.690
 nigeria is getting complicated day 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.820
 but well do not weigh what they have 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.930
 deserved the victory they are it's a game 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.080
 it's also the quality it paid to the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.709
 late i was the national coach know 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.530
 of bushido 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 who said that nigeria deserved its 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.870
 victory 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.470
 we entered shyly into the game 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.470
 we 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.810
 we let ourselves fall asleep a little 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.880
 game of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.090
 this nigeria team that she did 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.180
 his match he must be shot 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180
 hat 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.070
 we think just before half time 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.120
 while it was our high time 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.480
 felt like we were back 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 in the match 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.740
 after half time 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.800
 link 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.780
 one everywhere 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 on this goal on either side of the head and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.620
 we say that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.330
 the hardest is perhaps done we have 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.430
 and opportunities to score 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.290
 happily they show us that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.640
 application 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.310
 way little in the last pass 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.290
 forgiveness in last gesture and 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.960
 a little lucidity and serenity we did not 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.440
 not played 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.030
 on it was best arranged 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.300
 in front of him there was a lack of 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.640
 simplicity 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.870
 and then it's on a counter at that moment 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.670
 there of an engine that 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.270
 we take this second goal 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.820
 and who knocks us off 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.510
 to this nigeria team that has cracked 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.130
 play his match 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.960
 today alain who have entered but 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.110
 it did not really change the game of the 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.440
 Ivory Coast fida parigot agree with 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.210
 you 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.530
 no it will not change much 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.140
 not the time to analyze 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.880
 this elimination is 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.350
 essono match 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.000
 head to head may 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.180
 for now it's mostly big 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.180
 sadness 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.470
 not necessarily 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.940
 all the Ivorian people 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.440
 who should imagine how much 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.180
 it's very hard for the players I 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.760
 can just tell you that I'm assuming 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.200
 totally this this elimination is 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.480
 eq the players worked as 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.590
 I did not really want it with 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.840
 a lot of the application concentration 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.800
 of determination unfortunately this is 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.560
 it was played out to a few things and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.810
 and it was not for us to continue with 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.080
 the team but I want to show 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.409
 with her if he allowed me after 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.680
 I completely assume my 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.639
 my work 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.990
 I do them honestly 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.120
 professional 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.620
 you know defeat is part of my 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.180
 job 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.169
 we can not always win 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.780
 we learn 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.389
 also in 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.849
 in those moments 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.120
 I analyze 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.780
 at rest and then 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.780
 then we 'll see
