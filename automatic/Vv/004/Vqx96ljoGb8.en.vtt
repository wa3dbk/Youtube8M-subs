00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 many days friends subscribers of 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.150
 youtube in this video we are going to talk about 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.859
 the most current in the world of gear break 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.719
 and we will also give some details 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.410
 about the new apple update 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.730
 with ios 7.0 point 2 we go with the logo and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.730
 let's start with the direct 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.439
 ok guys first and what ya 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.759
 many of you know is that this 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.380
 paul week and see or ios 7.02 and is 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.750
 only to eliminate fragmentation 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.730
 because you all know that moments 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.879
 after several hours after 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.680
 came out the iphone 5 x 5 c appo I release a 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.649
 update only for those two 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.579
 teams that was the ios 7.0 point one 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.960
 but now throws the 7.0 points two that 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.670
 solves several errors but to me 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.760
 personally I did not see that he solved me 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.100
 a lot for example I'm waiting 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 something an update that focuses on 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.519
 repair the battery problem that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.140
 we have in year 7 but I 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.920
 personally I did not see you say and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.939
 you had that improvement in ios 7.0 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.379
 point 2 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.640
 I did not make a video because I really do not 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.320
 I saw it necessary it is not an update 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.170
 great is something that you can do 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 from the phone and that is something that 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.070
 I'm going to talk now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 does not change anything for an eventual gear 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 break in ios 7 since the xerez for 17 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 has not yet been released so without 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 problem why I did not make video what 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 I reported on facebook on twitter and also 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 mariano font dotcom something that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.660
 I want to say also guys this 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 many of the news I do not make them a 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.020
 video for them because we already talked about it 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 in the podcast or it was already spoken in Martian 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.690
 dotcom font 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.520
 so for example when I speak in 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 the podcast that we're going to record a lot 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 after I finish this video 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.910
 when it is already said in the podcast for me 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.530
 I already think that everyone has 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.430
 listened to and that's why I do not do the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.899
 video understand me so they have nothing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.610
 to follow us in the podcast I'm going to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.289
 leave in the description here so that it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.539
 subscribe to the power that we maintain there 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.160
 also informed and on our page 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.619
 that juan is also doing a 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.990
 article specifically about this and I what 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.910
 I will leave here saying everything with 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.530
 more details here I 'm just going to go 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.320
 by arribita then let's continue now 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.350
 let's talk about jerry for ios 6.1 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.819
 point four or six points 1.3 for 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.909
 devices that are all 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.790
 in that version and it's that you have a 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.129
 tethered jailbreak that is working 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
 but still first of all this ter and 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.480
 in the second place it has many errors 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.700
 are working on that that's for the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.439
 devices that are in 6.1 point 3.4 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.450
 I personally would like to know 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.599
 how many of the community are still in 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.359
 ios 6 because according to the news you 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.010
 they know that everyone has gone up and 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.780
 many of the community gave me 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.189
 marcia I did not have to go up and invent 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.859
 an excuse but I know that really 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.450
 they went up because they like ios 7 and I 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.250
 they say oh Martian unfortunately I had 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.629
 to climb I do not worry about your 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.250
 device 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.349
 if you go up like I did a video 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.969
 telling him of the consequences that there are 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.459
 in climbing and the consequences that there are in 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.629
 stay explained that place here 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.730
 below in case you did not have it 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.120
 seen if you have the jailbreak in year 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.650
 of 6.1 point 26 points 1.3 is already 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 working on that they 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.129
 the group of emails uploaded a video 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.829
 I'm going to leave here below where 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.889
 it shows to cydia working in the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.510
 iphone 5 now you will say Martians and 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.129
 we already have a jailbreak 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.750
 for the 6 points 1.3 and 6 points 1.4 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.579
 because we use ourselves as regularly 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.640
 we do because we do not use those 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.280
 vulnerabilities for ios 7 which is more 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.430
 the most current system and what happens is 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.989
 that was already tested and those vulnerabilities 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.110
 they were covered, so those 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:51.989
 vulnerabilities are not available no 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.609
 they are for use at ios 7 ok so 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.120
 those good skills can not be 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.579
 use and since they are only for me 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.319
 6 points 1.4 for that is that you are 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.359
 working remember to tell me here below 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.760
 which of you is still waiting 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.290
 in boil kim 6.1 point 4 yo 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.730
 personally on the one hand if I am 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.450
 waiting but already my device 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.840
 main is in ios 7 now let's 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.400
 talk about the boss in ios 7 is also being 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.310
 working several of the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.490
 vulnerabilities that worked yes but 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.710
 there is still much the cibers 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.780
 example pact and those who are working 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.340
 also nerd moscow that was one of the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.800
 I was working in a network 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.340
 and now it's together with the pacers have 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.760
 a lot of confidence are quite sure of 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.490
 that we are going to have a curry for ios 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.020
 seven the question is when and there is 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.270
 when I say it 's good guys 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.970
 remember for the previous herb in ios 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.070
 six that we had available in 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.620
 September and it was not until January or 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.330
 February where we had the tool 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.770
 to do the jailbreak I do not want them 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 say that it will last until January 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.680
 precisely but we will have to wait 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.360
 and wait a lot to subscribe like me 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.790
 I always say subscribe to this channel 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.550
 that since something comes out I'm going to do 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.340
 one of the first to inform you and in 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.990
 do the tutorial ok and we also have 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.060
 an extension that you already know 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.760
 many of you have it every time 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.620
 that I upload a new video and the 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.180
 extension in google chrome inform you 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.280
 I'm going to leave it down here also 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.289
 of the problems we have for 17 is 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.130
 that syria mobile its right and winter's 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.320
 word are not working in ios 7 or 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.660
 that will not work once we have 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.340
 the jailbreak will not work what 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.590
 it is expected that by the time we have 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.490
 the 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:44.190
 and for that is 7 we can already saurik beech 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.180
 fixed that problem I make myself understand 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.100
 you already know that install cydia and the 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.020
 Yerbal are two different things the 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.930
 jailbreak is the process to open the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.240
 phone to make the phone 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.940
 they can be installed cydia ya syria is 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.590
 a separate program and the one in charge 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.100
 decide already we all know that is aurich 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.040
 aurich said that both Syria and winter 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.620
 boeing or subtracting are broken in ios 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.870
 7 As I told you, it is expected that for 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.700
 when we have that tool and those 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.190
 problems are solved but that is 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.919
 one more problem that is added to the 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.160
 account problems of 'break' 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.660
 ios 7 another thing is that we all have 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.690
 to understand that there is a difference in 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.229
 the I see a 17 and the jury for the 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.850
 iphone 5 that and 5 I know what I mean 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.979
 to the new devices the fact of 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.540
 that we have helium breaking 17 does not want 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.520
 say take it will work for 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.740
 the background 5 specifically the iphone 5 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.840
 it's because the iphone 5 contains the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.290
 same components as the iphone 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.600
 but we all know that the iphone 5 s 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.430
 has a new processor has the like 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.990
 processor and it has a architecture of 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:58.560
 64 bits so I do not expect that when 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.840
 have the jailbreak ios 7 We will 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.770
 have the jerry for iphone 5 s al 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.740
 same time are two different things ok 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.960
 now if that happens to that 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.729
 let's have the pekin ior 17 someone 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.910
 start working on the iphone 5 is 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.260
 specifically that can be a 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.150
 possibility but I do not want me 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.639
 misunderstand when I say gear break 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.010
 for ios 7 I'm not necessarily 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.930
 talking about jailbreak on the iphone 5 s 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.880
 ok so guys I 'm going to leave you 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.070
 this little video I do not know how many 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.740
 minutes I've been recording but only 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.419
 I wanted to give you that little app of that 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.880
 small update to keep them 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:37.950
 informed and as always here we are going 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.789
 to keep informed with anything 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.919
 that they leave 100% recommended that they read the 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.510
 article that juan is doing now 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.430
 he has not finished it yet 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.380
 has many more 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.700
 that the ones I can mention in 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.800
 this video so I'm going to give you the 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.550
 article here below ok this has been 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.170
 all for today 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.730
 remember to subscribe for me 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.610
 I warned every time he made a new video 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.610
