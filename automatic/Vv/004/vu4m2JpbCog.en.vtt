bigger<00:00:13.019> forearms<00:00:13.830> by<00:00:14.429> working<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> muscle

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
bigger forearms by working out a muscle

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.960 
bigger forearms by working out a muscle
in<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.839> called<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> brachioradialis<00:00:16.970> which

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
in them called the brachioradialis which

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.920 
in them called the brachioradialis which
is<00:00:18.150> right<00:00:18.449> here<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.680> extends<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
is right here it extends from your the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
is right here it extends from your the
lower<00:00:22.140> part<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.710> your<00:00:22.800> upper<00:00:23.580> arm<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
lower part of your upper arm and it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.960 
lower part of your upper arm and it
attaches<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.080> your<00:00:25.140> wrist<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.400> lower<00:00:26.609> part<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
attaches to your wrist so lower part of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.259 
attaches to your wrist so lower part of
the<00:00:27.090> upper<00:00:27.330> arm<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.769> wrist<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.119> your

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the upper arm to your wrist this is your

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.260 
the upper arm to your wrist this is your
brachioradialis<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> specific

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
brachioradialis and there's a specific

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
brachioradialis and there's a specific
way<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.510> work<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.320> muscle<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.489> pretty

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
way to work this muscle out it pretty

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
way to work this muscle out it pretty
much<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.450> involved<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.079> flexing<00:00:37.559> your<00:00:37.680> elbow

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
much is involved in flexing your elbow

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
much is involved in flexing your elbow
so<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> curl<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.480> work

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so you're going to do a curl to work

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.810 
so you're going to do a curl to work
this<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.530> there's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> specific<00:00:41.219> curl

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this out but there's a specific curl

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.630 
this out but there's a specific curl
that<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.559> work<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.100> muscle

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that you can do to work out this muscle

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.450 
that you can do to work out this muscle
to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.690> maximum<00:00:46.350> effectiveness<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to the maximum effectiveness that you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.520 
to the maximum effectiveness that you
can<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.390> you're<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> curl

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
can so you're not going to do a curl

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369 
can so you're not going to do a curl
with<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.430> palms<00:00:50.700> facing<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:52.140> that's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
with your palms facing up because that's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
with your palms facing up because that's
going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> primarily<00:00:52.949> work<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.850> biceps

going to primarily work out your biceps

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
going to primarily work out your biceps
muscle<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> curl

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
muscle you're not going to do the curl

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360 
muscle you're not going to do the curl
with<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.149> palms<00:00:57.570> facing<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:59.190> going

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with your palms facing down that's going

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
with your palms facing down that's going
to<00:00:59.460> primarily<00:00:59.730> work<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.570> brachialis

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to primarily work out your brachialis

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
going to do a curl in between those two

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to do a curl in between those two
positions<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> you're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
going to do a hammer curl so you have

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
going to do a hammer curl so you have
the<00:01:18.840> weight<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you come up slow and then come down slow

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.810 
you come up slow and then come down slow
come<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.479> slow<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.950> come<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:32.220> slow

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
come up slow and then come down slow

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
come up slow and then come down slow
it's<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.570> easy

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's very easy

it's very easy
don't<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.070> jerky<00:01:35.579> motions<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.360> all

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
don't do any jerky motions like this all

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.170 
don't do any jerky motions like this all
over<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> place<00:01:37.369> just<00:01:38.369> control<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> weight

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
over the place just control the weight

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630 
over the place just control the weight
and<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> allow<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.979> work
