00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.269
 it seemed as simple as it got right 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.710
 April fool but the curious dlc stand 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.329
 halo of far cry 3 yes it is instead 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.219
 materialized in the form of a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.840
 funny concentrate of quotes 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.949
 colors and taste kitsch and genuinely 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.949
 80s 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.769
 the dragon is something totally 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.079
 unexpected forget far cry 3 e 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.010
 let yourself be ferried about the future year 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.440
 is 2007 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 how could it be imagined 30 years ago 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.609
 rex is a cyber soldier with more than 80 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.350
 percent of the synthetic body a 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.600
 charismatic protagonist with the joke 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.369
 always ready the hoarse voice the heart that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.799
 it pulsates for the homeland it will serve 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.570
 until his death if necessary in his 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.920
 cloths you will live a short adventure that is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.750
 a real love letter for 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.729
 the carefree and naive nature of 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.649
 old single action real wire movies 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.090
 conductor of a plot that proposes a 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.460
 world destroyed by the apocalypse of 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.530
 an apocalypse occurred after a tragic event 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 second war in Vietnam 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.190
 our enemies are the omega force al 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.479
 money from the general slot 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.729
 everything is told to us through 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.319
 two-dimensional animated interludes that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 they seem to come from a videogame from the era 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.459
 16 pitt the game experience there 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 is proposed through a filter that 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.360
 colors everything as if we were looking 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.459
 the vhs damaged through a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 CRT TV not in place 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.789
 it's so different to let cry 3 that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 however it is not required to be able to 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.690
 install blood dragons there is a map 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.070
 freely explorable with lots of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.750
 there are animals to hunt 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.579
 outposts to conquer that once 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 freed allow you to buy weapons 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.539
 and access these secondary missions 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.009
 if completed, they guarantee upgrades for 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.479
 own weapons and additional experience 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.340
 to level up 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.750
 improves the characteristics of rex ma le 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.939
 skills are learned automatically 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.799
 eliminating any choice inside 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.810
 of the sandbox structure can be followed 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.429
 the main campaign that unfolds 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 along seven missions even if it is 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.249
 strongly recommended to enjoy yourself thoroughly 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.799
 each quest to gain access 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.510
 to the most powerful paraphernalia the arsenal 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.220
 and it is not surprising that it is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780
 a real shame given the exaggerated tone 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.549
 of the production he would surely have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.200
 allowed some extra extravagance 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.510
 compared to ordinary guns 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.670
 if present, the arch returns 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.060
 while aiming the gal gives moments of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.060
 great satisfaction 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.410
 the gameplay does not propose particular 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 additions to the formula already seen 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.640
 in the end far cry I say the blog wagon yes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.620
 proposes as a sort of synthesis ai 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.269
 steroids and indeed always possible 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.250
 observe the situation from the distance 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.530
 parker and soldiers and strategic points e 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.510
 decide how to attack details like i 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.130
 dragons to attract with extracted hearts 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.620
 from the bodies of the enemies, however, they return a 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.550
 all new taste the playful experience 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.709
 these monsters are practically 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.840
 invincible but fortunately they have one 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.120
 poor view allowing our rex 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 to avoid them by crouching and then 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.900
 fun to use them to cause of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.930
 healthy chaos by bringing video and half of the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 melee 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.170
 far cry 3 ball dragon is a concentrate 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.819
 of kits and citations an integral part of the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.590
 game and as such we prefer not 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.239
 show you more to leave the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.700
 pleasure of discovering how much love for 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.170
 80s movies and music and video games is 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.810
 managed to push the guys from ubisoft 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
 montreal the aesthetic aspect puts into 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.109
 highlights the style more than any other 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.390
 breezy of the production starting 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.650
 from the aforementioned graphic filter passing 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.280
 for the design of environments and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.260
 characters 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.639
 unfortunately also because of these is done 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.620
 note a certain repetitiveness 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.060
 for the rest of the graphics engine is the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.709
 same as the original title then 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.450
 excellent even though we found it in the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 pc version a little less optimized 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.049
 sound compartment makes history in itself 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.030
 thanks to traces written with sound 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.409
 of other times able to pass by 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.150
 synthetic percussion in style 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.739

 rocky with a sequence in the middle 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 interminable of references the same 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.959
 extremely positive judgment but the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.489
 audio commentary in English with 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.989
 protagonist who does not regret the
