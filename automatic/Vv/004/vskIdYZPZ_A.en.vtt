different level in chance mint table
kind<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.920> stumble<00:00:14.429> there<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:14.790> basically<00:00:15.780> what

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
kind of stumble there but basically what

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.660 
kind of stumble there but basically what
it<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:18.650> depending<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.920> much<00:00:20.039> XP<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it is is depending on how much XP you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
it is is depending on how much XP you
have<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.720> example<00:00:21.810> let's<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.590> say<00:00:22.740> i<00:00:22.769> only

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
have for example let's just say i only

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.790 
have for example let's just say i only
have<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.990> at<00:00:24.990> least<00:00:25.080> 10<00:00:25.859> XP<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> walk<00:00:27.269> up

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
have like at least 10 XP so I walk up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
have like at least 10 XP so I walk up
drop<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> few<00:00:29.279> times<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> find<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
drop this a few times so I find the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.650 
drop this a few times so I find the
thing<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:31.759> like<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> level<00:00:33.420> 5

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
thing that I like like a level 5

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
thing that I like like a level 5
something<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> let's<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.570> say

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
something and I get that let's just say

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
something and I get that let's just say
I'm<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> I'm<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.190> higher<00:00:38.370> level<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I'm a I'm a little bit higher level and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
I'm a I'm a little bit higher level and
as<00:00:40.340> it<00:00:41.340> shows<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.879> medium<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.070> enchant

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
as it shows up here medium in enchant

as it shows up here medium in enchant
stand<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> pressure<00:00:45.210> plate<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.960> stand

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
stand on the pressure plate so you stand

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.160 
stand on the pressure plate so you stand
on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> pressure<00:00:47.160> plate<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.960> little

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
on the pressure plate you get a little

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
on the pressure plate you get a little
bit<00:00:49.410> higher<00:00:50.030> enchantment<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.860> least

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
bit higher enchantment so like at least

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
bit higher enchantment so like at least
a<00:00:55.190> OC<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> 23<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
a OC like it here like a 23 and you can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
a OC like it here like a 23 and you can
get<00:00:58.770> that<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
get that and if you have like let's just

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
get that and if you have like let's just
say<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> went<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> end<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> kill<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
say you went to the end and kill the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
say you went to the end and kill the
boss<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.670> drop<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> lever<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.430> stand

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
boss you can drop this lever and stand

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.929 
boss you can drop this lever and stand
on<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.729> it'll<00:01:12.600> drop<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.400> bunch<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> bookshelfs

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
on it it'll drop a bunch of bookshelfs

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.950 
on it it'll drop a bunch of bookshelfs
down<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:16.909> in<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> case<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
down and in this case you can have a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
down and in this case you can have a
give<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.560> seconds<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> high

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
give me go seconds I want to find a high

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.859 
give me go seconds I want to find a high
enchantment<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:28.070> third<00:01:29.070> level<00:01:29.670> 34<00:01:30.060> x<00:01:30.329> with

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
enchantment a third level 34 x with

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.700 
enchantment a third level 34 x with
efficiency<00:01:31.500> three<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> be

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
efficiency three so I just like to be

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.140 
efficiency three so I just like to be
straightforward<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.909> not

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
straightforward with this I this is not

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810 
straightforward with this I this is not
my<00:01:39.360> idea<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> original

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
my idea if you want to see the original

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.319 
my idea if you want to see the original
video<00:01:42.240> where<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.049> from<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.270> go<00:01:45.270> to

full full credit for this I just managed
to<00:01:57.390> figure<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.320> matter<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.310> few

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
to figure this out in a matter of a few

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.850 
to figure this out in a matter of a few
hours<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.390> let<00:02:01.229> me<00:02:02.420> oops

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.790 

turn<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.850> time<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.150> date<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:09.140> let's<00:02:09.530> get<00:02:09.650> this

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
turn the time of date and let's get this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.060 
turn the time of date and let's get this
started<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.900> right<00:02:15.140> below<00:02:15.380> where<00:02:15.740> we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
started so this is right below where we

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.490 
started so this is right below where we
are<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.740> piston<00:02:19.190> right<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:20.470> right<00:02:21.470> in

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
are and that piston right here right in

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.170 
are and that piston right here right in
front<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.430> where<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.880> pressure

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
front of that that's where the pressure

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.790 
front of that that's where the pressure
plate<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.570> where<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> stand<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.110> when<00:02:24.710> you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
plate is where you stand on when you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.050 
plate is where you stand on when you
stand<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.160> pressure<00:02:25.370> plate<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:26.000> turns<00:02:26.500> it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
stand on the pressure plate it turns it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.960 
stand on the pressure plate it turns it
makes<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.240> current<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.020> sends<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:33.970> the

makes the current on and sends the the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.930 
makes the current on and sends the the
redstone<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:36.080> state<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.860> don't<00:02:37.580> know<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.820> they

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
redstone on state I don't know what they

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.330 
redstone on state I don't know what they
call<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.330> redstone<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:38.810> state<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.680> each

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
call it the redstone on state to each

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.000 
call it the redstone on state to each
one<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.580> these<00:02:40.730> Pistons<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.330> off<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.680> way

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
one of these Pistons and off this way

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:52.920 
one of these Pistons and off this way
and<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:45.470> way<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:49.780> vertical<00:02:51.610> avert

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
and this way to a vertical avert

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.090 
and this way to a vertical avert
vertical<00:02:54.640> inverter<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.800> can<00:02:57.890> see<00:02:58.070> right

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
vertical inverter as you can see right

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.870 
vertical inverter as you can see right
there<00:02:58.490> and<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.640> case<00:03:01.910> it's<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:04.580> soon<00:03:04.790> as

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
there and in this case it's as soon as

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.410 
there and in this case it's as soon as
it<00:03:04.970> comes<00:03:05.180> up<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.750> sends<00:03:07.060> current<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.240> these

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
it comes up it sends current to these

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.510 
it comes up it sends current to these
Pistons<00:03:09.130> which<00:03:10.130> extend<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.000> does<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.630> bottom

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
Pistons which extend and does the bottom

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.640 
Pistons which extend and does the bottom
bookshelves<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.750> your<00:03:14.870> left<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.260> right<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
bookshelves to your left and right and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.510 
bookshelves to your left and right and
also<00:03:16.220> sends<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.850> current<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.270> here<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:18.680> an<00:03:19.100> and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
also sends the current up here to an and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.400 
also sends the current up here to an and
gate<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:20.030> believe<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.930> shuts<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
gate I believe this is and shuts that

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.240 
gate I believe this is and shuts that
torch<00:03:21.650> off<00:03:21.860> which<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.670> will<00:03:22.850> show<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:23.840> how

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
can see the the lower pistons right here

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.350 
can see the the lower pistons right here
and<00:03:40.640> right<00:03:40.670> here<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:43.489> Pistons<00:03:43.850> from

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
and right here and the Pistons from

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.070 
and right here and the Pistons from
below<00:03:45.370> also<00:03:46.370> come<00:03:47.239> up<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.540> run<00:03:50.750> outside

again real quick and fly up when you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.500 
again real quick and fly up when you
flip<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.300> lever<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:58.060> sends<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.090> current<00:03:59.390> up

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
flip this lever it sends the current up

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.509 
flip this lever it sends the current up
to<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.140> other<00:04:00.350> side<00:04:02.860> which<00:04:03.860> shuts<00:04:04.160> off<00:04:04.310> that

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
to the other side which shuts off that

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.410 
to the other side which shuts off that
torch<00:04:04.880> which<00:04:05.209> will<00:04:05.480> turn<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.170> torch<00:04:06.620> on<00:04:06.860> and

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
torch which will turn this torch on and

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.100 
torch which will turn this torch on and
send<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.540> current<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:10.360> these<00:04:11.360> Pistons<00:04:11.930> up

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
send the current to these Pistons up

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.330 
send the current to these Pistons up
here<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:12.739> well<00:04:13.519> as<00:04:13.790> these<00:04:14.060> Pistons<00:04:14.600> down

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
here as well as these Pistons down

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.550 
here as well as these Pistons down
underneath<00:04:16.340> which<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:16.910> can't<00:04:17.150> see

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
underneath which you can't see

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.700 
underneath which you can't see
and<00:04:19.239> if<00:04:20.239> we<00:04:20.450> go<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.959> turn<00:04:21.139> on<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.350> switch<00:04:21.650> now

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
and if we go and turn on the switch now

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.290 
and if we go and turn on the switch now
as<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.820> see<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.150> drops<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:28.520> drops<00:04:28.760> those

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
as you see it drops it drops those

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.690 
as you see it drops it drops those
bookshelves<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:30.139> give<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.380> those<00:04:30.700> really

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
bookshelves to give you those really

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.270 
bookshelves to give you those really
high<00:04:31.730> enchantments<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.680> I'll<00:04:33.830> just<00:04:34.070> show

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
high enchantments and it I'll just show

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.720 
high enchantments and it I'll just show
you<00:04:35.139> see<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.260> turns<00:04:36.440> off<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.740> torch<00:04:37.010> turns

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
you see it turns off that torch turns

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.020 
you see it turns off that torch turns
that<00:04:37.970> torch<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:39.610> basically<00:04:40.610> does<00:04:41.000> a

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
that torch on and basically does a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.100 
that torch on and basically does a
little<00:04:41.180> circle<00:04:41.570> around<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:44.330> activate

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
little circle around here to activate

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.610 
little circle around here to activate
all<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.530> Pistons<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.810> side<00:04:48.110> that's

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
all the Pistons and on this side that's

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.510 
all the Pistons and on this side that's
a<00:04:49.330> little<00:04:50.330> error<00:04:50.540> but<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.990> this<00:04:51.169> side<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.620> just

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
a little error but on this side it just

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.750 
a little error but on this side it just
goes<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.419> bottom<00:04:54.260> row<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.650> pistons<00:04:55.220> vs.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
goes to the bottom row of pistons vs.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.050 
goes to the bottom row of pistons vs.
this<00:04:55.940> side<00:04:56.210> where<00:04:56.450> it<00:04:56.750> goes<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:58.280> right

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
this side where it goes to the right

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.100 
this side where it goes to the right
side<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.870> gate<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:01.870> turns<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:03.020> on

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
side of the and gate and turns it on

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.480 
side of the and gate and turns it on
saves<00:05:03.800> me<00:05:04.240> redstone<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.600> guess<00:05:06.440> even<00:05:07.430> though

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
saves me redstone I guess even though

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.430 
saves me redstone I guess even though
this<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:07.760> kind<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.030> crazy<00:05:08.210> in<00:05:08.479> general<00:05:08.780> but

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
this is kind of crazy in general but

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.990 
this is kind of crazy in general but
yeah<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.760> is<00:05:10.970> pretty<00:05:11.240> much<00:05:11.389> it<00:05:11.510> if<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:13.000> if

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
yeah this is pretty much it if this if

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.920 
yeah this is pretty much it if this if
