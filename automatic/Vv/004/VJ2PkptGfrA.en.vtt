00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 This is a brand to feed animals. 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.260
 the employee was 110 thousand vehicles 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.909
 so they can play 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.599
 the lighting sounding several times a day every day of the week 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.299
 after christmas 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 manuel lourenço 22 times a day 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.310
 not 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 the revolt will feed 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 at the same time 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 check out the military headlines 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 this country 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.290
 now we're sure 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 for less 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 well below the solano pair 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 I can wait now went beyond the planet is a very simple way 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.270
 when google is not in the back so the pet can have 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.050
 this bump accidentally 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.660
 uruguai a eu - and the servers 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.320
 since the month of January 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.820
 on the main screen looks like freedom 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 with the guarantee and now 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.940
 city ​​residents 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.790
 discharge 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 and within that schedule any goalkeeper 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.409
 nor the programming is very simple we are going to enjoy that today live 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.350
 these networks at 47 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.359
 I'll 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.359
 shows that with this elaborate program 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.450
 1-1 for example herodes and 48 now or scheduled for at 10 and 49 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030
 are vendelino 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.230
 lcl meaning 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.340
 vote in the field 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.320
 now 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.080
 are laws 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.880
 and 48 then I'll put 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.290
 exactly 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.320
 did not speak 49 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 and record 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.380
 and wait 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.249
 the triggering of payment 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.460
 recorded and will not be diverted 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.569
 few seconds 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 she passes without working 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.269
 this role also 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.409
 has recourse 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.479
 He is a resident of the street. 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.879
 the wing is now the turn of willians 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.179
 and if the action of vandals 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.579
 the water line 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.539
 So 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.870
 the program when they arrive on time 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.169
 the idea of ​​water exchange 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.039
 so I'll schedule 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.389
 kissinger 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.589
 but 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.149
 10 hours 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.149
 it's 55 thousand 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.569
 remembering that this equipment 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.930
 if there is a power failure 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.930
 it will still keep its programming 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:21.259
 so let's wait for this air exchange
