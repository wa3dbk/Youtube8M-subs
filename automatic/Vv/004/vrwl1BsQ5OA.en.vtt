00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
fruit diet raw vegan diet and I got my

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.529 
fruit diet raw vegan diet and I got my
blood<00:00:16.650> tested<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> my<00:00:17.580> triglycerides<00:00:17.850> were

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
blood tested and my triglycerides were

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
blood tested and my triglycerides were
really<00:00:18.900> high<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:20.070> freaks<00:00:20.369> people<00:00:20.460> out

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
really high and that freaks people out

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.380 
really high and that freaks people out
so<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.150> want<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> cover<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> today

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
so I want to cover that today

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
so I want to cover that today
triglycerides<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.660> simply<00:00:25.199> fats<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
triglycerides are simply fats in the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.460 
triglycerides are simply fats in the
blood<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:26.910> different<00:00:27.630> than

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
blood and they are different than

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.759 
blood and they are different than
cholesterol<00:00:29.220> itself<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.529> ways

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
cholesterol itself and there's two ways

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
cholesterol itself and there's two ways
to<00:00:32.070> raise<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.430> triglycerides<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to raise your triglycerides one is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
to raise your triglycerides one is
eating<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.290> fatty<00:00:34.620> standard<00:00:35.309> American<00:00:35.670> diet

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
eating a fatty standard American diet

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
eating a fatty standard American diet
but<00:00:36.600> number<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> conversion<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
but number two is the conversion of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
but number two is the conversion of
carbohydrates<00:00:41.090> into<00:00:42.090> triglycerides<00:00:43.969> due<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
carbohydrates into triglycerides due to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.260 
carbohydrates into triglycerides due to
a<00:00:45.149> process<00:00:45.600> called<00:00:45.780> de<00:00:46.110> novo<00:00:46.739> lipogenesis

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
a process called de novo lipogenesis

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.740 
a process called de novo lipogenesis
which<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.480> happen<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> eat<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.149> those

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
which can happen when you eat and those

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
which can happen when you eat and those
what<00:00:52.379> those<00:00:52.500> carbs<00:00:52.860> are<00:00:52.980> doing<00:00:53.190> they're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
what those carbs are doing they're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
what those carbs are doing they're
stored<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> liver<00:00:54.059> which<00:00:54.840> creates<00:00:55.260> an

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
stored in the liver which creates an

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.420 
stored in the liver which creates an
elevated<00:00:56.010> raises<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.879> triglyceride<00:00:57.539> levels

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
elevated raises your triglyceride levels

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.779 
elevated raises your triglyceride levels
so<00:00:59.430> this<00:01:00.270> happens<00:01:00.809> often<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:02.309> people<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so this happens often with people that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
so this happens often with people that
are<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.430> forced

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
are you know really really forced

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890 
are you know really really forced

triglycerides<00:02:31.849> are<00:02:31.970> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.750> um

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.140 

that's<00:02:36.739> what<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.099> is<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.220> if<00:02:37.609> your<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:38.000> you're

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
that's what it is so if your if you're

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
that's what it is so if your if you're
eating<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.480> lifestyle<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.379> have

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
eating this lifestyle and you have

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.800 
eating this lifestyle and you have
elevated<00:02:40.220> triglycerides

elevated triglycerides
my<00:02:42.680> guess<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:42.920> number<00:02:43.340> one<00:02:44.859> you're<00:02:45.859> eating<00:02:46.010> a

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
my guess is number one you're eating a

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.860 
my guess is number one you're eating a
lot<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.430> simple<00:02:46.730> sugars<00:02:47.030> from<00:02:47.120> fruit<00:02:47.480> which<00:02:47.690> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
lot of simple sugars from fruit which I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.819 
lot of simple sugars from fruit which I
do<00:02:47.950> fine<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:50.120> number<00:02:50.420> two<00:02:50.659> or<00:02:51.079> number<00:02:51.109> two

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
do fine and number two or number two

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.680 
do fine and number two or number two
you're<00:02:52.579> really<00:02:52.940> forced<00:02:53.359> feeding<00:02:53.480> yourself

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
you're really forced feeding yourself

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.210 
you're really forced feeding yourself
which<00:02:54.139> is<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.560> common<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.790> lifestyle

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
which is can be common in this lifestyle

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.250 
which is can be common in this lifestyle
it's<00:02:58.220> really<00:02:58.700> taught<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.299> do<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.629> and<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.019> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it's really taught to do that and I and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.149 
it's really taught to do that and I and
the<00:03:00.439> reason<00:03:00.829> that's<00:03:01.069> done<00:03:03.129> initially<00:03:04.129> I

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
the reason that's done initially I

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.530 
the reason that's done initially I
believe<00:03:04.579> is<00:03:04.849> because<00:03:05.389> if<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.670> took<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
believe is because if you took the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.140 
believe is because if you took the
source<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:09.049> calories<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.730> foods<00:03:14.000> you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
source of calories the the foods you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.240 
source of calories the the foods you
came<00:03:14.389> from<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.840> fatty<00:03:15.079> foods<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.769> processed

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
came from the fatty foods the processed

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.550 
came from the fatty foods the processed
foods<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.730> meat<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.090> dairy<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.599> oils<00:03:18.079> there

foods the meat and dairy the oils there

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.530 
foods the meat and dairy the oils there
so<00:03:18.799> Chloe<00:03:19.129> dense<00:03:19.699> that<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.239> go<00:03:20.359> to<00:03:20.419> this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
so Chloe dense that if you go to this

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.400 
so Chloe dense that if you go to this
lifestyle<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:22.069> just<00:03:22.280> try<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.549> eat<00:03:23.410> plants

up<00:03:28.280> under<00:03:28.609> eating<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.180> then<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.389> either<00:03:29.870> one

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
up under eating and then you either one

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.409 
up under eating and then you either one
you<00:03:30.709> fail<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.519> this<00:03:31.609> lifestyle<00:03:32.090> because<00:03:32.329> you

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
you fail on this lifestyle because you

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.740 
you fail on this lifestyle because you
go<00:03:32.510> back<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.870> binging<00:03:33.349> on<00:03:33.470> crap<00:03:33.829> or<00:03:34.669> two<00:03:35.000> you

get tired you lose hair and you blame
the<00:03:37.819> lifestyle<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.540> often<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:39.560> taught

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
the lifestyle so often it's taught

the lifestyle so often it's taught
really<00:03:40.430> really<00:03:40.760> smashing<00:03:41.449> the<00:03:41.569> carbs<00:03:42.019> which<00:03:42.709> I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
really really smashing the carbs which I

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.649 
really really smashing the carbs which I
tend<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.459> agree<00:03:43.609> with<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.180> beginning<00:03:44.479> of

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
tend to agree with in the beginning of

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.530 
tend to agree with in the beginning of
this<00:03:44.750> lifestyle<00:03:45.370> but<00:03:46.370> once<00:03:46.579> your<00:03:46.699> body<00:03:46.819> adapts

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
this lifestyle but once your body adapts

this lifestyle but once your body adapts
that's<00:03:47.720> where<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:47.959> different<00:03:48.409> I<00:03:49.190> think<00:03:49.819> you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
that's where I'm different I think you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.309 
that's where I'm different I think you
need<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.120> eat<00:03:50.209> until<00:03:50.629> you're<00:03:50.870> completely

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
need to eat until you're completely

need to eat until you're completely
satisfied<00:03:52.150> my<00:03:53.150> triglyceride<00:03:53.840> levels<00:03:54.139> score

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
satisfied my triglyceride levels score

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.119 
satisfied my triglyceride levels score
really<00:03:54.680> well<00:03:54.829> I've<00:03:55.310> done<00:03:55.459> my<00:03:55.519> blood<00:03:55.879> test

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
really well I've done my blood test

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.089 
really well I've done my blood test
they're<00:03:58.129> about<00:03:58.370> 130<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.299> believe<00:03:59.829> they're<00:04:00.829> low

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
they're about 130 I believe they're low

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.289 
they're about 130 I believe they're low
so<00:04:02.409> if<00:04:03.409> you're<00:04:03.799> having<00:04:04.299> elevated

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
so if you're having elevated

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.009 
so if you're having elevated
triglycerides<00:04:06.489> my<00:04:07.489> guess<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:08.090> you're

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
triglycerides my guess is you're

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.979 
triglycerides my guess is you're
force-feeding<00:04:09.650> yourself<00:04:10.269> which<00:04:11.269> is<00:04:11.419> possible

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
force-feeding yourself which is possible

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.789 
force-feeding yourself which is possible
but<00:04:12.859> if<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.220> feel<00:04:13.459> really<00:04:13.699> good

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.430 

it's<00:04:17.459> not<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:18.120> much<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.599> worry<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.259> you're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
it's not so much of a worry as if you're

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.249 
it's not so much of a worry as if you're
eating<00:04:20.060> fat<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> diet<00:04:21.389> which<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.079> cause

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
eating fat in the diet which can cause

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.170 
eating fat in the diet which can cause
atherosclerosis<00:04:22.830> heart<00:04:23.580> disease<00:04:23.879> and<00:04:24.030> so

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
atherosclerosis heart disease and so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.149 
atherosclerosis heart disease and so
forth<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:24.629> I<00:04:24.840> hope<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.770> answered<00:04:26.099> your

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
liver your body's going to convert that

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.589 
liver your body's going to convert that
into<00:04:41.159> triglycerides<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:42.150> store<00:04:42.389> in<00:04:42.509> the

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
into triglycerides and store in the

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.839 
into triglycerides and store in the
liver<00:04:42.870> excess<00:04:43.500> glycogen<00:04:44.099> which<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.580> good

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849

how<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.210> feel<00:05:03.569> but<00:05:04.380> most<00:05:04.620> likely<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.310> due<00:05:05.550> to

your<00:05:05.940> body<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.599> storing<00:05:07.050> excess<00:05:07.500> glycogen

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
your body just storing excess glycogen

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.159 
your body just storing excess glycogen
in<00:05:08.370> your<00:05:08.490> liver<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.150> converting<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.900> by<00:05:10.139> a

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
in your liver and converting that by a

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.040 
in your liver and converting that by a
process<00:05:10.650> called<00:05:10.680> de<00:05:11.130> novo<00:05:11.550> lipogenesis<00:05:12.050> and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
process called de novo lipogenesis and

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.279 
process called de novo lipogenesis and
turning<00:05:13.409> that<00:05:13.500> into<00:05:13.560> fat<00:05:15.289> triglycerides

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
turning that into fat triglycerides

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.200 
turning that into fat triglycerides
blood<00:05:16.560> fat<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.069> your<00:05:17.159> liver<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:17.460> hope<00:05:18.180> that

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
blood fat and your liver so hope that

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.149 
blood fat and your liver so hope that
