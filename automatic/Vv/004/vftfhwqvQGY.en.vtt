00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.260
 it's a girl so choose I want 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.760
 in a video of which as you see I 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.050
 do not wear anything 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.920
 this fight is a video a bit 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.910
 particular as certain his I 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.020
 would like to have the hair completely 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.070
 red but I still have leftovers of 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.860
 caller assures black etc 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.529
 and suddenly I do not want the sets and 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.030
 because it never gets me too much and 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.510
 blow bah I had to find a 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 solution 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 so I talked to him and she told me 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.290
 advised to take a color color b4 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.250
 so in fact it's an English pro life 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.420
 that does not contain ammonia anything that 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.960
 contains products 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.909
 let's say a little better than fading 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.860
 so that does not damage the hair and 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.000
 does that to depigment the color of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.100
 hair so so it's written that actually 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 at the base so I took for them 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.650
 dark hair 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.299
 so basically we're like that 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.520
 and after that we actually become with the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.320
 color is sure the hair so I 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.180
 I'm going to test so I'll detach you 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.890
 hair when you see a little the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 cuzon color because the camera one 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.460
 not necessarily see correctly I come 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.930
 as I often attached that I like 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.560
 not too much the color of my chances 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.210
 moment I have a mix so I'm 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.960
 simple to do are chauvinistic room 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.710
 So the school is what is to reach 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.690
 actually see everything under the saddle well 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.440
 see 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 then on the top it's red and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 red highlights 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 so suddenly I'm pretty tired 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.980
 of my color I wanted to test that so 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.530
 I test it and come back after 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.600
 you see the result 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.290
 so that's the result of the color of 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.130
 So we can see that I still 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.500
 lost a lot of color especially 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.320
 Darche to light brown 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.810
 so here I think that with this 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.670
 color to make my red 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.880
 so I'm explaining to you actually I have 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.230
 already had ordered two in case 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.830
 so 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 I actually explain inside you 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.610
 have three products plus a leaflet but 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 she is completely in English so 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 you can put it aside it 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.390
 especially they use terms a 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:53.730
 little chimay we do not know so 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.730
 you have an activator and 1 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.380
 I have a short black hole short you mix 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.880
 these two products there together bouchiki 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.800
 for about 30 seconds and then 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.700
 you apply on all of your 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.860
 your hair then you 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.830
 surround you with your cellophane head 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.069
 it's not very aesthetic it's not very 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.250
 nice but the result is there I find 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.530
 so once you have this prod ceased 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.500
 of stuff there you let act 30 minutes 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 if you have short hair and 60 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.470
 min if you have long hair for 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.690
 to be imposed much further 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.950
 but hey I asked myself 1:10 or 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.900
 1h20 I think I'll eat between 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.299
 both of them so after at the level of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.360
 the smell it's just despicable it's a 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.400
 mix of rotten egg fruits this is 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.180
 disgusting but what does it take 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.220
 then once you've done that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.450
 rinse for about 5 minutes 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.190
 ago syed 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.239
 then you do this shampoo so 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.410
 this is the stage opened this shampoo 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.950
 you leave five minutes and you 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.290
 rinse five minutes so here I am 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.670
 do them twice because there is 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.180
 far too many products I do them 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.370
 go back twice and that's actually when 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.380
 you remove the cellophane from your head 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.250
 you see no results really 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.400
 nothing at all it's not like a 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.970
 fading convoy the hair convoy the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.470
 hair finally get bleached in 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.810
 do it's ranks once we get this 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.229
 who to all who spoke I had at the beginning 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.320
 I had red had gone after 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.840
 I had blue blue for black in 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.789
 done and after I had yellow for the 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.870
 remains that to their discoloration that me 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.550
 stay in my hair so in fact 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.590
 really really takes off everything that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.750
 you have in the game it's just 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.550
 mind blowing and what's funny is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.800
 that I find my natural color and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.630
 this is good 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.380
 five six years that I had not seen my 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.190
 natural feather so here is this product is 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.190
 really top 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.650
 for the price I bought 2 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.820
 for 25 euros 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.849
 so that's still five workouts 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.500
 including an ola I bought him on 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.539
 ebay uk because actually it's a 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.529
 English product so we do not find in 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.609
 France at all 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:10.799
 at all so here you have a site 

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:13.169
 I do not ask you in info bar or 

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:15.569
 that there is a lot of before after so 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.249
 this is frankly I recommend you 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.659
 i have really nickel hair like 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.939
 must see it and its grain shiny 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.849
 they are gone at all they are finally 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.579
 it's really a great product I 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.409
 found contrary to staining 

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:30.239
 that ruin the hair 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.599
 spikes of all there frankly it is 

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.079
 top 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.399
 so that's frankly so it's 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.969
 I'm a big kiss here I want 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:37.969
 say soon even
