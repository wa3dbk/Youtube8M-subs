this<00:05:03.910> point<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.240> Activision<00:05:04.630> hasn't

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
this point that Activision hasn't

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.150

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
pay-to-play thing I mean that would be a

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.110 
pay-to-play thing I mean that would be a
bold<00:05:07.930> move<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.680> with<00:05:08.830> how<00:05:08.890> successful<00:05:09.340> the

happen i agree with hutch and some of
the<00:06:07.840> other<00:06:07.960> people<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:08.380> think<00:06:09.479> nip<00:06:10.479> knobs

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
the other people that I think nip knobs

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.219 
the other people that I think nip knobs
are<00:06:10.930> dan<00:06:12.030> talked<00:06:13.030> about<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.450> or<00:06:13.570> infinite<00:06:14.020> sad

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
are dan talked about it or infinite sad

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.500 
are dan talked about it or infinite sad
as<00:06:15.070> well<00:06:15.400> we<00:06:15.580> kind<00:06:15.729> of<00:06:15.760> have<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:15.970> same<00:06:16.000> opinion

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
as well we kind of have the same opinion

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.650 
as well we kind of have the same opinion
I<00:06:17.020> think<00:06:17.800> s<00:06:18.040> Indies<00:06:18.310> does<00:06:18.700> we<00:06:18.880> kind<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.300> all<00:06:19.450> are

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
I think s Indies does we kind of all are

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.200 
I think s Indies does we kind of all are
on<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.810> same<00:06:19.870> line<00:06:20.140> no<00:06:20.350> Joker<00:06:20.790> alex<00:06:21.790> is<00:06:22.000> in<00:06:22.180> the

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
on the same line no Joker alex is in the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.969 
on the same line no Joker alex is in the
isn't<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:22.960> huge<00:06:23.080> fan<00:06:23.320> of<00:06:23.350> it<00:06:23.500> because<00:06:23.530> it<00:06:23.770> sets<00:06:23.890> a

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
isn't a huge fan of it because it sets a

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.469 
isn't a huge fan of it because it sets a
precedent<00:06:24.430> for<00:06:24.460> more<00:06:24.880> paid<00:06:25.120> stuff<00:06:25.330> in<00:06:25.419> the

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
precedent for more paid stuff in the

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.420 
precedent for more paid stuff in the
future<00:06:25.690> but<00:06:25.750> that's<00:06:25.930> just<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:26.710> way<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:26.950> is<00:06:26.979> and

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
future but that's just the way it is and

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.970 
future but that's just the way it is and
I<00:06:27.910> think<00:06:27.940> that's<00:06:28.240> just

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
I think that's just

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.530 
I think that's just
you<00:06:29.640> know<00:06:29.700> what<00:06:29.790> I<00:06:29.850> mean<00:06:29.940> like<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.180> agree<00:06:30.510> I

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
you know what I mean like I agree I

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.480 
you know what I mean like I agree I
think<00:06:30.630> eventually<00:06:31.070> they<00:06:32.070> might<00:06:32.310> make

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
think eventually they might make

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.220 
think eventually they might make
multiplayer<00:06:33.000> like<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.240> pan<00:06:33.450> add<00:06:33.870> on<00:06:34.020> pay

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
multiplayer like a pan add on pay

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.840 
multiplayer like a pan add on pay
function<00:06:34.650> I<00:06:34.860> don't<00:06:35.280> think<00:06:35.310> it's<00:06:35.490> coming<00:06:35.610> as

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
function I don't think it's coming as

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.730 
function I don't think it's coming as
soon<00:06:36.000> as<00:06:36.150> some<00:06:36.240> people<00:06:36.450> think<00:06:36.480> it<00:06:36.720> is<00:06:36.840> but<00:06:37.080> you

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
soon as some people think it is but you

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.170 
soon as some people think it is but you
know<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:38.040> if<00:06:38.370> multiplayer<00:06:38.790> is<00:06:38.850> going<00:06:38.970> to<00:06:39.030> stay

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
know and if multiplayer is going to stay

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.090 
know and if multiplayer is going to stay
the<00:06:39.330> same<00:06:39.480> at<00:06:39.810> least<00:06:40.020> in<00:06:40.170> modern<00:06:40.410> warfare<00:06:40.560> 3<00:06:40.710> as

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
the same at least in modern warfare 3 as

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.310 
the same at least in modern warfare 3 as
it<00:06:41.310> is<00:06:41.480> currently<00:06:42.480> just<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.080> can<00:06:43.230> get

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
it is currently just that you can get

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.630 
it is currently just that you can get
you<00:06:43.680> know<00:06:43.710> more<00:06:43.890> I'd<00:06:44.010> stuff<00:06:44.250> whether<00:06:44.460> it's

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
you know more I'd stuff whether it's

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.160 
you know more I'd stuff whether it's
like<00:06:44.760> additional<00:06:45.330> stats<00:06:45.630> and<00:06:45.960> stuff<00:06:46.050> like

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
like additional stats and stuff like

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.870 
like additional stats and stuff like
that<00:06:46.230> whatever<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:46.980> mean<00:06:47.340> if<00:06:47.430> there's<00:06:47.550> actually

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
that whatever I mean if there's actually

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.080 
that whatever I mean if there's actually
if<00:06:48.390> like<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:48.720> have<00:06:49.140> to<00:06:49.290> buy<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:50.340> premium<00:06:50.820> you

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
if like you have to buy the premium you

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.060 
if like you have to buy the premium you
know<00:06:51.180> elite<00:06:51.540> thing<00:06:51.780> to<00:06:52.320> get<00:06:52.470> new<00:06:52.650> guns<00:06:52.890> and

stuff<00:06:53.130> like<00:06:53.340> that<00:06:53.400> that<00:06:54.240> are<00:06:54.270> more<00:06:54.450> powerful

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
stuff like that that are more powerful

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.360 
stuff like that that are more powerful
yeah<00:06:55.170> obviously<00:06:55.560> ok<00:06:55.920> I<00:06:55.950> would<00:06:56.100> say<00:06:56.190> that's

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
yeah obviously ok I would say that's

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.700 
yeah obviously ok I would say that's
that's<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.670> little<00:06:56.850> annoying<00:06:57.230> but<00:06:58.230> even<00:06:58.440> then<00:06:58.560> I

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
that's a little annoying but even then I

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.710 
that's a little annoying but even then I
like<00:06:58.950> I'm<00:06:59.280> not<00:06:59.520> amount<00:06:59.820> up<00:07:00.030> in<00:07:00.150> arms<00:07:00.300> about<00:07:00.450> it

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
like I'm not amount up in arms about it

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.570 
like I'm not amount up in arms about it
like<00:07:00.810> like<00:07:01.080> some<00:07:01.290> people<00:07:01.320> are<00:07:01.650> so<00:07:01.950> maybe

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
like like some people are so maybe

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.620 
like like some people are so maybe
because<00:07:02.850> I'm<00:07:02.940> just<00:07:03.060> kind<00:07:03.210> of<00:07:03.240> detached<00:07:03.450> from

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
because I'm just kind of detached from

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.820 
because I'm just kind of detached from
the<00:07:03.750> call<00:07:03.900> of<00:07:03.960> duty<00:07:03.990> serious<00:07:04.410> right<00:07:04.530> now<00:07:04.650> but

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
the call of duty serious right now but

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.380 
the call of duty serious right now but
it's<00:07:04.920> not<00:07:05.070> to<00:07:05.490> me<00:07:05.640> it's<00:07:05.820> really<00:07:06.150> not<00:07:06.270> a<00:07:06.330> big

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
it's not to me it's really not a big

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.490 
it's not to me it's really not a big
deal<00:07:06.540> and<00:07:06.780> I<00:07:06.870> think<00:07:07.020> a<00:07:07.050> lot<00:07:07.110> of<00:07:07.200> people<00:07:07.290> are

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
deal and I think a lot of people are

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.560 
deal and I think a lot of people are
freaking<00:07:07.800> out<00:07:07.890> for<00:07:08.100> really<00:07:08.670> no<00:07:08.700> reason<00:07:08.820> and

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
freaking out for really no reason and

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.490 
freaking out for really no reason and
all<00:07:09.720> this<00:07:09.810> like<00:07:09.870> I<00:07:10.080> said<00:07:10.260> it's<00:07:10.410> still

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
all this like I said it's still

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.350 
all this like I said it's still
speculation<00:07:11.160> like<00:07:11.790> I'm<00:07:11.910> we<00:07:12.000> know<00:07:12.150> that's

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
speculation like I'm we know that's

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.640 
speculation like I'm we know that's
going<00:07:12.540> to<00:07:12.690> exist<00:07:12.990> but<00:07:13.140> how<00:07:13.320> it's<00:07:13.500> going<00:07:13.620> to

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
going to exist but how it's going to

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.990 
going to exist but how it's going to
look<00:07:13.710> and<00:07:14.040> what<00:07:14.100> exactly<00:07:14.250> it's<00:07:14.670> going<00:07:14.820> to<00:07:14.880> be

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
look and what exactly it's going to be

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.250 
look and what exactly it's going to be
and<00:07:15.270> if<00:07:15.360> it's<00:07:15.480> gonna<00:07:15.570> be<00:07:15.720> worth<00:07:15.870> and<00:07:16.050> all<00:07:16.140> that

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
and if it's gonna be worth and all that

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260 
and if it's gonna be worth and all that
stuff<00:07:16.380> you<00:07:17.370> know<00:07:17.400> what<00:07:17.460> I<00:07:17.580> mean<00:07:17.670> we<00:07:18.000> don't<00:07:18.090> know
