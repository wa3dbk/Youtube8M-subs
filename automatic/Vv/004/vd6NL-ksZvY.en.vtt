a pain in the ass this mission because

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.430 
a pain in the ass this mission because
it<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:45.269> probably<00:02:46.269> dated<00:02:46.569> about<00:02:46.690> 20<00:02:47.200> times

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it is probably dated about 20 times

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.809 
it is probably dated about 20 times
before<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.980> got<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.549> one<00:02:48.579> take

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.509 

all<00:02:54.390> right<00:02:54.569> now<00:02:55.110> wait<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> door<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.799> close

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.179 

down<00:02:59.519> we<00:02:59.790> go<00:03:00.319> when<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.409> hit<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.650> floor<00:03:01.890> you

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
down we go when you hit the floor you

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:10.150 
down we go when you hit the floor you
want<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.489> get<00:03:02.609> into<00:03:02.939> creep<00:03:03.900> mode

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.480

and over to the door you can look

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.810 
and over to the door you can look
through<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.700> keyhole<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.670> there's<00:03:16.670> no

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
through the keyhole like so there's no

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.100 
through the keyhole like so there's no
real<00:03:17.000> point<00:03:17.090> because<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.720> can't<00:03:17.930> see

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
real point because you can't see

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.220 
real point because you can't see

anything but it's we're just sort of

killing time till that card heads into

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.900 
killing time till that card heads into

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
chance you might get spotted but you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.500 
chance you might get spotted but you

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.990 
going and you'll probably see the guard
in<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.230> second<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.950> makes<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.370> little<00:04:18.640> bit<00:04:18.760> longer

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
in a second it makes a little bit longer

here<00:05:41.679> because<00:05:41.769> we're<00:05:42.039> going<00:05:42.189> to<00:05:42.249> catch<00:05:42.459> the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
here because we're going to catch the

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:57.749 
here because we're going to catch the
truck<00:05:42.939> again<00:05:49.619> here<00:05:50.619> it<00:05:50.859> comes<00:05:51.129> now<00:05:56.759> we're

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
truck again here it comes now we're

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.680 
truck again here it comes now we're
going<00:05:57.879> to<00:05:57.939> chase<00:05:58.239> it<00:05:58.419> down

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.550 

into<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.530> back<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:04.130> crouch<00:06:04.400> down<00:06:04.430> again

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
into the back and crouch down again

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.780 
into the back and crouch down again
basically<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.920> is<00:06:07.100> going<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.370> take<00:06:07.580> us<00:06:07.760> right

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
basically this is going to take us right

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.260 
basically this is going to take us right
out<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.900> tunnels<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:09.790> pretty<00:06:10.790> much<00:06:10.970> right

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
out of the tunnels and pretty much right

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.170 
out of the tunnels and pretty much right
where<00:06:11.480> we<00:06:11.840> want<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.170> be<00:06:12.290> at<00:06:13.100> our<00:06:13.130> accident<00:06:16.180> and

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
where we want to be at our accident and

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.560 
where we want to be at our accident and
the<00:06:17.900> importance<00:06:18.440> of<00:06:18.620> staying<00:06:18.950> in<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.250> truck

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
the importance of staying in the truck

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.740 
the importance of staying in the truck
will<00:06:20.570> be<00:06:20.600> evident<00:06:21.140> in<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.380> second<00:06:21.970> as<00:06:22.970> you<00:06:23.570> see

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
will be evident in a second as you see

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.310 
will be evident in a second as you see
about<00:06:24.080> six<00:06:24.470> guards<00:06:28.780> there's<00:06:29.780> another<00:06:30.080> way

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
about six guards there's another way

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.490 
about six guards there's another way
where<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.830> can<00:06:31.780> do<00:06:32.780> a<00:06:32.810> lot<00:06:33.050> of<00:06:33.080> sneaking

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
where you can do a lot of sneaking

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.680 
where you can do a lot of sneaking
around<00:06:33.890> and<00:06:34.130> going<00:06:34.550> up<00:06:34.670> and<00:06:34.820> down<00:06:35.060> tunnels<00:06:35.510> but

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
around and going up and down tunnels but

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.570 
around and going up and down tunnels but
this<00:06:36.620> I<00:06:36.980> found<00:06:37.310> seems<00:06:37.790> to<00:06:38.000> be<00:06:38.120> the<00:06:38.270> easiest

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
this I found seems to be the easiest

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.820 
this I found seems to be the easiest
provided<00:06:40.580> you<00:06:40.700> can<00:06:40.880> get<00:06:41.240> past<00:06:41.540> that

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
provided you can get past that

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:50.269 
provided you can get past that
checkpoint<00:06:43.630> which<00:06:44.630> can<00:06:45.110> be<00:06:45.290> a<00:06:45.320> pain

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:50.279 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.819 

right<00:06:50.459> up<00:06:51.359> the<00:06:51.539> hill<00:06:51.569> and<00:06:51.899> now<00:06:52.139> it's<00:06:52.409> actually

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:52.829 
right up the hill and now it's actually

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.269 
right up the hill and now it's actually
at<00:06:52.919> another<00:06:53.219> checkpoint<00:06:54.739> we<00:06:55.739> can<00:06:55.919> just<00:06:56.099> stay

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
at another checkpoint we can just stay

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:05.940 
at another checkpoint we can just stay
in<00:06:56.309> the<00:06:56.519> truck

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.050 

now<00:07:06.730> slowly<00:07:07.270> moving<00:07:07.780> up<00:07:08.010> and<00:07:09.010> you<00:07:09.550> should<00:07:09.610> see

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
now slowly moving up and you should see

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.570 
now slowly moving up and you should see
the<00:07:10.090> dart<00:07:10.480> in<00:07:10.810> a<00:07:10.930> second<00:07:11.320> or<00:07:11.440> two<00:07:12.600> or<00:07:13.600> three

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
the dart in a second or two or three

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.050 
the dart in a second or two or three
there's<00:07:15.580> one<00:07:16.980> two<00:07:17.980> three<00:07:18.010> four<00:07:20.400> all<00:07:21.400> right<00:07:21.610> now
