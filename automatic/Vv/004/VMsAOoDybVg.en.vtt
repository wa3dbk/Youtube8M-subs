everywhere and it's a very deep taproot

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.590 
everywhere and it's a very deep taproot
so<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.290> hard<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.799> rid<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.420> some<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
maybe in a place where you don't mind if

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.999 
maybe in a place where you don't mind if
itself<00:02:05.969> seeds<00:02:06.299> mine<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.500> said<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.799> it's
