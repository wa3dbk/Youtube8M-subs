00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.139
 ah 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.990
 Hello and welcome to this new 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.420
 video in which I have been bringing you a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.660
 mode not described I think it's for the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.220
 peanut cup and in which is the model 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 screen pasta so good let's start the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.740
 island of the description of the video in the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.410
 which will contain two files 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.230
 two files the texture package that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.900
 will require and the script mode that would be 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.880
 this script up the dog 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.610
 this would be the texture pack that 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.720
 I will change the name credit cap 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.820
 so they do not get confused and well 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.240
 all those downloaded we go to the blog 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.710
 launcher pro obviously first those 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.320
 files they have to have in the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.090
 internal storage so that what 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.670
 can move to the lounge pad so 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.390
 well let's go to the black launcher and first 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.010
 that nothing is the dog this one 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.770
 let's go to options the launcher 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.550
 textures package and let's choose the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.740
 that the one that comes out here I believe and pasta yes that 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.130
 would be the texture package that requires 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.800
 and the other would be to go up here that we 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.040
 my key comes out that now I am going to 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.630
 show I'm to visit hide and now 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:45.100
 yes now I do know if it looks let's go 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.820
 here we are going to go to the key and have 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 bloated admin more mote script and 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.900
 we are going here is going to matter 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.900
 internal storage and we search 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.710
 that would be crepes is about 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.750
 jc js 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.240
 I'm wrong 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.000
 and good and we proceed this is and must 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.170
 be activated this say activated or 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 deactivated and good now we go to the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.510
 mime and let's take out 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.920
 first thing we're going to have to have and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.400
 we're going to have to have this a quad a 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 gold cube 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.290
 that the gold cube we're going to have to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.659
 create a gold cube and a sheet we're going 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.829
 to make a cube of hours that comes out this 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.200
 this block as with a wing ghost 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.950
 take more and now we should have 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.970
 this we are going to have to have sheets for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.609
 here we are going to have leaves and that would be already 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.069
 would be to activate it and they have to have 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.629
 just like this in normal difficulty is not 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.489
 peaceful why will it be that they are 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.489
 sleeping and good 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.720
 of gold and this 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.790
 and we will place them anywhere in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.230
 the cube of the gold block 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.519
 and to activate them we only press on 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.519
 him and he is already 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.549

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.530

 You have to run, they are not going to hit me 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.849
 to have to kill all this there is something 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.020
 rare that when one invokes all 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:49.539
 this the the changes the whole subject is done 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.060
 come back at night and the star star 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.490
 they start to go round and round if it is 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.629
 that this one does it in the city ​​outside and 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.849
 obviously this has to be 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.729

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:08.050
 gold that changed the texture and gave us 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.729
 as a power that causes it to burn 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.090
 there they could see that they were burning 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.330
 I do not know who I'm going to burn 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.680

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.559
 only that in between will kill 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.040
 that is in decline and that the invisible 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:41.450
