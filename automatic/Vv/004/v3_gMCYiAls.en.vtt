00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:13.099
 it's all fx77 as it is good 7.7 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.200
 as usual the team enters so 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.090
 so what do I mean yes 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.990
 here we are again for a new video on 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.000
 the trophies and so this trophy there it's 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.730
 on rails 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.800
 so to realize it is simple 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 it's really simple 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.000
 simply to have had six or seven stages 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.640
 offered life of stone wood especially 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.770
 way and stone - distinguishes 64 1 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 finally we have fun a referent 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.990
 authors can for the 500 m makes me 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.840
 gain speed 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.540
 it saves us from putting rails 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.239
 accelerator so we see flat glass 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.560
 yeah that suits you this com you feel 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.960
 if you have a lot of orders is stone 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.070
 can he do plagiarism not know that so 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.690
 So here we have created our little 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.780
 500 m I think we are not very far 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.610
 500 m in several months so 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.159
 servette is pile hair what we did not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.310
 nothing to do especially so there we 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.049
 still has two maps and so clement 7 7 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 beat you will do me the honor of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.700
 the immigrant did not arrive downstairs you me 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:27.630
 will say this tenor of a game pushes you the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:30.540
 morals just like a crib so what 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.009
 I propose that I too want 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.140
 do this trophy so I'm going to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.780
 launch 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.100
 and that's when I lost because 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
 that I almost see which supporter without 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 wrong because yes I can, but it is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.550
 so the dish becomes a landscape 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 so beautiful between heaven and earth to 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.220
 flat a little proof the chp flat on 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 is not dead we are all want to celebrate 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.770
 sees the hand is what is left because 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420
 that there you can not climb length 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.350
 endless 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.799
 so here is the map following the map 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.140
 and here is the terminus and the trophy 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.920
 should arrive the trophy will not delay 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.260
 I think 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.829
 and here is the top right you have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.959
 montreux is frankly negligent 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.470
 not the stone and do it is great 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.049
 important 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.420
 yeah and wood a lot of water 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.950
 the noises me it's still going the wood 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's okay but they make it one to do 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.019
 its rails but good neglect especially not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.489
 the stone and do it's a council and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.709
 after the party, as you feel 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.390
 knowing that the 500 but must be 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.390
 made from point a to point b 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.360
 how to say if there is purpose or right you 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.990
 can not do anything turn around the masters 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.670
 cancel each other shop I tell you for 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.980
 avoid taking me for a crazy having 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 created that so it must be good 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.270
 so I hope to have helped you but has 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.569
 plus the all over again at the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.569
 next
