00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
lesson before I was basically just

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.100 
lesson before I was basically just
driving<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.519> thought<00:03:47.819> why<00:03:48.450> am<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.720> being<00:03:48.750> so

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.080 
driving and I thought why am I being so
cautious<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.709> I'd<00:03:49.860> be<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.220> double<00:03:50.700> check<00:03:50.970> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
cautious like I'd be a double check to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.369 
cautious like I'd be a double check to
make<00:03:51.150> sure<00:03:51.239> I've<00:03:51.420> got<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.629> in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.870> right<00:03:51.900> gear

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
make sure I've got it in the right gear

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.589 
make sure I've got it in the right gear
I've<00:03:52.620> double<00:03:53.310> check<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.700> make<00:03:53.730> sure<00:03:53.909> I'm<00:03:54.209> going

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
I've double check to make sure I'm going

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.710 
I've double check to make sure I'm going
the<00:03:54.810> exact<00:03:55.170> speed<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.330> suddenly<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.480> just

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the exact speed and suddenly I just

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.929 
the exact speed and suddenly I just
thought<00:03:57.840> why<00:03:58.080> am<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.319> doing<00:03:58.379> this<00:03:58.590> click<00:03:59.370> I'm

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
thought why am I doing this click I'm

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.640 
thought why am I doing this click I'm
all<00:04:00.209> sudden<00:04:00.480> I'm<00:04:00.629> driving<00:04:01.080> like<00:04:01.260> it's<00:04:01.470> need

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
all sudden I'm driving like it's need

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.320 
all sudden I'm driving like it's need
for<00:04:01.860> speed<00:04:02.069> I'm<00:04:02.250> friggin<00:04:02.549> shifting<00:04:02.939> gougeres

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
for speed I'm friggin shifting gougeres

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.789 
for speed I'm friggin shifting gougeres
like<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.689> fast<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.019> furious<00:04:04.409> or<00:04:04.560> something

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
like it's fast and furious or something

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.490 
like it's fast and furious or something
like<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:04.950> except<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.730> follow<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.959> speed<00:04:07.230> laws

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
like that except I follow the speed laws

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.990 
like that except I follow the speed laws
and<00:04:07.769> every<00:04:07.920> other<00:04:07.950> law<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.760> speed

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and every other law not just the speed

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.089 
and every other law not just the speed
block<00:04:09.239> but<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> don't<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.170> don't<00:04:10.290> run<00:04:10.830> anybody

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
block but I don't I don't run anybody

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.220 
block but I don't I don't run anybody
over<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.239> all<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.390> think<00:04:12.569> it's<00:04:12.900> more<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.170> a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
over all in all I think it's more of a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.229 
over all in all I think it's more of a
thing<00:04:13.439> in<00:04:13.560> where<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:14.069> they<00:04:14.519> took<00:04:14.849> a<00:04:14.970> long<00:04:15.209> time

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
thing in where if they took a long time

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.349 
thing in where if they took a long time
to<00:04:15.659> learn<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.440> drive<00:04:16.739> then<00:04:17.609> maybe<00:04:18.090> that

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
to learn to drive then maybe that

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.689 
to learn to drive then maybe that
affects<00:04:18.690> on<00:04:18.900> like<00:04:19.229> how<00:04:19.410> they<00:04:19.590> look<00:04:20.100> at<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.549> if

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
affects on like how they look at you if

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.340 
affects on like how they look at you if
that<00:04:20.880> makes<00:04:21.090> sense<00:04:21.299> like<00:04:21.750> say<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.109> talking

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
that makes sense like say I'm talking

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.710 
that makes sense like say I'm talking
about<00:04:22.410> 20<00:04:23.160> years<00:04:23.400> so

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
about 20 years so

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.700 
about 20 years so
