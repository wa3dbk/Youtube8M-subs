00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.100
 downloaded from behind the appstore 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.960
 like any other just drive in 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.059

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 Download the application it is absolutely 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.809
 is free 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.239
 when you first start the application will ask 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.680

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.909

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.909
 you replace 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.960
 that 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.090
 steering on here is a 4-digit pincode which 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 you can invent yourself for 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.979
 each time not to enter 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.150

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.000
 password to it 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.570
 Well, I took advantage of this option 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.610
 so I am immediately worth the pin code you 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.670
 initially when you start the application 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.170
 the first time you will enter the number night 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.159
 account and password 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.740
 I'll go around with a four-digit code after 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.869
 correct data entry 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.380

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.890
 there is investment only in pamm accounts 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.409
 so we will look at this tab before 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.470
 of all but she is naturally the most 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.470
 popular 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.590
 so as soon as you open here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.370
 a list of all yours appears 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.640

 the amount of your investment in them is current 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.120
 this moment 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.330
 if you click on any of 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.819
 inflation bills then appear here 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.370
 such a window where there is 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.519
 data about your funds volume 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.519
 investment 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.450
 present value poyan income that would 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 the amount received on this account 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.820

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.760
 purchased and your creation date 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.560
 investment account is also active 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.190
 applications if they are available and 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 can see which of the levels 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.850
 offer and you are currently 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.250
 few and that feet governing 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.630
 provide more favorable conditions for 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.170
 offer to increase the amount of investment and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.290
 yield chart at the top is not a schedule 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 exactly your profitability is a graph of total 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.920
 yields pamm accounts for all time 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.860
 of existence here you can see 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.110
 that since '10 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.170
 aunt figs although I have an investment in this 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.650
 PAMM account only a couple of months 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 even a little less 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.120
 also below there are options to replenish and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.730
 withdraw funds 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.260
 but when withdrawing funds as you know they 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.520
 transferred to the personal account 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.190
 and replenish 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.760
 the account you can, too, only from the face 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.580
 accounts 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.690
 since it 's still mobile 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.330
 device and 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.360
 some ways to replenish through 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.500
 webmoney or some other payment 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.140
 systems either via bank transfer to 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.190
 sorry here to implement technically 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.740
 difficult therefore replenishment only 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.240
 perhaps directly from the personal account 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.850

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.010

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.010
 I can not demonstrate but there 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.810
 principle of possibility the same judging by 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.460
 program description 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.650
 There is also a tab personal accounts where 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.580
 You can see how much money you have on 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.970

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.039
 this is our profile tab the rest 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.960

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.849

 I don't have 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.210
 Search by parameters is natural 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.440
 minus but still don't forget that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.320

 this application is said 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.240
 quite useful but unfortunately 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.729
 very limited and worth noting 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.650
 currently at the time of this recording 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:53.740

 Unfortunately not for android platforms 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.509
 also hear nothing about developing 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:07.569
 applications so while this application 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.569
