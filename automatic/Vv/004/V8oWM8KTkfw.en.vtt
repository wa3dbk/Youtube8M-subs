00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.899
 how friends came that wonderful day 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 when we go on this phone I am long 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.040
 I thought the power of life to smoke here first 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.010
 I wanted to smoke enough but then I thought 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.050
 that we don’t know their boat they don’t want 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.390
 and decided to snuff speaker covered number one 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.680
 Here are the mixes try the black lady 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.680
 through the Cossack tube 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 enough where to sit down on I think 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.660
 here the question is just a prosecutor to smoke and and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.110
 all this when rubbing pass 1 matrix at 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110
 tit 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 we fill well I understand the case of clay on 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 smoke and do not need her 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 probably not afraid about the fat point so 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.330
 he is a topchi become small but we in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.090
 principle may be even good because 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.659
 what 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.280
 snuff out so this cum zucchini and with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.230
 poor tubes are perceived more 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.670
 Spicy than from bars and therefore 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.250
 try see this friends i 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 finally understood 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.850
 then my office rocking chair 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.850
 and run 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.540
 if I make this enemies I hope will 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.540
 I hear well 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.770
 anyway i would really like this 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:19.880
 I wanted because I did not want to like them 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:21.620
 listen to the black bad sound so i'm already 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.340
 told so dwell on it 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.989
 although frankly perceived 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.989
 gunner to a friend will and others 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 around the tube almost no 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.370
 It is heated because apparently the clay is thick 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.370
 and therefore to 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.840
 cooler so the attacks here are very 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:06.060
