looks<00:03:54.630> suspicious<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.410> would<00:03:55.530> have<00:03:55.739> a

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
looks suspicious that we would have a

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.740 
looks suspicious that we would have a
plant<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.370> but<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:56.790> any<00:03:56.940> case<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.420> you

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
plant like this but in any case as you

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.270 
plant like this but in any case as you
can<00:03:57.780> see<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.170> very<00:03:58.230> easy<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.830> hide<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.070> little

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
can see it's very easy to hide a little

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.600 
can see it's very easy to hide a little
vitamin<00:03:59.700> container<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.800> inside<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.400> keep

things that you can hide them in but at

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.670 
things that you can hide them in but at
the<00:04:23.510> same<00:04:23.690> time<00:04:23.900> they<00:04:24.170> don't<00:04:24.320> know<00:04:24.380> what

the same time they don't know what
they're<00:04:24.890> in<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.660> can<00:04:27.140> always<00:04:27.410> hide

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650

even in a plastic bag if you prefer and
that's<00:04:41.600> an<00:04:42.470> example<00:04:42.830> of<00:04:43.070> one<00:04:43.340> more<00:04:43.520> wave<00:04:43.790> and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that's an example of one more wave and

that's an example of one more wave and
hide<00:04:44.240> some<00:04:44.450> cash<00:04:44.690> if<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.740> hide<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.220> enough

different places it's never going to all
be<00:04:48.530> found<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:50.800> let's<00:04:51.800> wrap<00:04:51.980> up<00:04:52.190> with<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.430> few

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
be found so let's wrap up with a few

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.080 
be found so let's wrap up with a few
more<00:04:52.670> tips<00:04:54.160> ok<00:04:55.160> let's<00:04:55.340> do<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.490> quick<00:04:55.730> review<00:04:56.030> of

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
more tips ok let's do a quick review of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.790 
more tips ok let's do a quick review of
how<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.360> hide<00:04:56.600> money<00:04:56.630> around<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.260> house<00:04:57.500> in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
how to hide money around the house in

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.460 
how to hide money around the house in
addition<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.730> locations<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.930> we<00:05:00.110> looked<00:05:00.350> at

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
addition to locations that we looked at

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.980 
addition to locations that we looked at
already<00:05:00.670> there<00:05:01.670> are<00:05:01.850> two<00:05:02.180> important

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
already there are two important

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.290 
already there are two important
principles<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.620> should<00:05:03.800> know<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.850> first<00:05:05.120> is

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
principles you should know the first is

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.060 
principles you should know the first is
to<00:05:05.450> put<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.750> money<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:06.050> multiple<00:05:06.470> locations

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
to put the money in multiple locations

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.950 
to put the money in multiple locations
so<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:07.520> less<00:05:07.760> likely<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.240> criminals<00:05:08.900> can

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
so it's less likely that criminals can

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.440 
so it's less likely that criminals can
find<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.440> all<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.700> second<00:05:11.060> is<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.270> put

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
find it all and the second is to put

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.120 
find it all and the second is to put
more<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:12.020> money<00:05:12.200> in<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.620> better<00:05:12.830> hiding

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
more of the money in the better hiding

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.210 
more of the money in the better hiding
places<00:05:14.170> some<00:05:15.170> of<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.410> best<00:05:15.590> hiding<00:05:15.860> places

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
places some of the best hiding places

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.760 
places some of the best hiding places
are<00:05:16.670> places<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.390> require<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:18.230> thief<00:05:18.470> to

are places that require the thief to
