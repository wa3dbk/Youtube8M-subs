00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.130
 we're going to have back to what another program should be the world 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the field and we are in puerto berrío antioquia department 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.619
 they do not know that all the friends of the hacienda san juan de dios 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 let's talk today about nutrition 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.220
 a very important issue now that we have milk crisis and crisis 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.650
 in livestock production 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 and in turn also 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 problems with the tri because of the costs 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.790
 let's talk about supplementation let's talk about care in the cattle 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.710
 pure and also in the commercial treaties we are going to give you last 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.730
 reproductive technologies and in turn from the last leak is that there are 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.090
 improve the competitiveness of the livestock sector in our country 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.100
 very good morning we are today is again on the second finger path 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.640
 so on a field day 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.980
 dedicated to what is the production i percent 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.290
 use of 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 mouth mouse plaice and sorghum 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.040
 It is a special day because we also have the presence of 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.960
 argentinian nutritionist doctor horacio prevention 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 will help us 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 explaining what it is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120
 percent the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.350
 the use or inclusion of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.260
 e silage in diets in advance beef and dairy cattle 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.740
 the hacienda san juan de luz and especially if you love it and san juan de dios 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.170
 is dedicated to what is the production of preserved forages 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.070
 directed especially to bovines 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
 of specialized both meat and milk 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.400
 we had an experience of three years 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.670
 e in which we have tried to know 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.280
 different types of maize development in the area in the environment that we 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.460
 surrounds 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450
 We have a rainfall 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.589
 It must be around 2 thousand 900 millimeters 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:09.400
 which it's 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.829
 it augurs 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.409
 some very good first results in the production of corn 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.999
 more however in some are the times of the year we are going to have some 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.680
 with some drawbacks 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.119
 for access 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.649
 rain precipitation 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:31.359
 during those two years a beggar we have done percent down it deviates 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.439
 investigation 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.879
 we have done the work in the soil improvement part 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.509
 always guided by staff 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.809
 very qualified very technical 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.179
 that collaborates us so much in the part 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.180
 ed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 the band technical part as the feeding part 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.369
 corn silo aguán finger 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.760
 percent is a company that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.649
 at this time rousseff before 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.199
 the best sign that occurs in Colombia with some specifications 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.919
 as I say we have tried to keep them during the thymus year 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.540
 since we have reached the achievement of the right corn for the area 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.079
 with quality of nutrients 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.429
 essentials 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.219
 and optimal for nothing for the management and limitation of commercial cattle 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.659
 both meat and milk 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.629
 and cigars 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.169
 of card and the fact 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.409
 within the parameters that we handle, we try to get some 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.859
 materials with 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.119
 main ap 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.599
 characterize that they have is a life 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.359
 some silos in fact the quality entity with digestibility greater than 64% 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.719
 with one more matters the case of around 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.469
 65 to 70% 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:49.529
 i 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.719
 Let's also have p 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.029
 jobs 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.420
 in the materials 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.979
 how are the mouse map 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.309
 in the zone 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.309
 per hundred natural with proteins up to 25% 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.829
 All this 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.439
 due 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.540
 to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.309
 a good work team 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.089
 still nobody 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.819
 total delivery 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.289
 investigation 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.499
 for the armchair 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.660
 for the procurement of raw materials 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.400
 and especially to supply 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.340
 to all farmers 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.650
 customers and especially also the farm 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.650
 a material of excellent quality 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.570
 we know that it is not easy to produce we know who is not easy to reach 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.960
 where we are at this moment 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.029
 but we have made all the efforts 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.639
 n that are within our reach and we have used all the techniques 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.759
 and all the parameters that established the premundial 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.889
 for the production of a good food 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.490
 a good food 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 edited 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.069
 to all the animals 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.520
 e consume 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.229
 this type of

 g so much n 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.529
 in the Canary Islands as they had already done 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.430
 Although its cellulite production of meat and milk use this law 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.749
 but smart rotoplas the tall ones are Spanish the mint and protected 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:23.110
 It is easy to transport and install the winner front easily to use it 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.629
 rotoplas the plastic industry at the service of the Colombian capo 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.210
 send the word field as a text message to the number 89 40 answer the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.919
 questions 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.879
 and participated in the knowledge contest in the agricultural sector 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.310
 the person who has more knowledge will be filled with don poncho 5 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.550

 1,200 years of genetic development in France 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.869
