00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 Accepting pets is one of them 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.590
 Even now 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.919
 Red orange 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.329
 I'm making Port eight but 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.139
 I'm thinking I'm Nadal now and this time 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.820
 Management fishing spot type this 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.419
 I said it was bad 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:23.189
 The unexpected part does not take action but marvinbanez advances 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310
 This compilation 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.079
 It looks like this 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.869
 I'll get lost in the real area 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.130
 Saying that it is being used 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.450
 That jockey is happening 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.900
 Here is attacking 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.270
 Another first work 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660
 Over the provisions 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 The capacity of the pendulum is the plant 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 Inorganic Shinobu Nomura 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.830
 Where to extend the half pitch 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.720
 Push in the mechanism or put in disagreement 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 Half first baseman 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.670
 The more you pull by friction stir, the more you are the moon 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 But this is the lead above 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.230
 At that time 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.300
 I'm leaving Komireva and I've got a waste here too and I know 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 What 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.860
 a. 2 rounds if you have the effect of putting together 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 Even if Madonna is up, it is all right 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.630
 I'm going to be there because it's like 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.750
 p2 already has 40 points in the same city for 30 minutes 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.640
 The above plus 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.220
 6 items pulled 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 f1 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.590
 as its name suggests 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410
 There is a river breeze 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 Put a color that you think is edged 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.090
 Hard to throw 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 Do not fly 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.710
 I will say 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.500
 I have a beer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.690
 Heavy rain po say many times as long as stable employment 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.870
 Though 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.880
 Water that changes how you lower your head by using a thin body 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.119
 Action too 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.850
 You will be sharp for convenience 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.030
 So it's good to have a drink pitch 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.669
 I can not accept the book of Lee Hayasaka and I have it now 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.709
 5 Because you use the general history
