00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.990
 well that's all if I kraft table 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.279
 for a new video and today 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 I am in the company of two 2 ipod jeans 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.130
 Claude Wolff increased her time 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.860
 to get going 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.720
 we are here for the map of the month 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.520
 it's the 8th combines the seventh I believe 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.230
 no is the seventh heaven of the month 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.390
 October 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.230
 ok good nah okay so this time it's 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.960
 me making the map 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.550
 and it's not just importing the pc 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.850
 at the end of the match and here as he goes 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.710
 be an objective map exactly 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.879
 so we are not at all on the same 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.949
 map years as usual 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.210
 here we are maps ourselves but not on 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.149
 put it the same part we are not on 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.489
 non solo server each from our side so 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.109
 you mean the panels then laid them 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.210
 reactors of a reserve under the pillars 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.479
 This is a reactor NIESR so it is 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.559
 the block that's there and the rectors get 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.620
 cache in the map 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.879
 there is one in the sphere and therefore six 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.909
 on the outside the sphere what makes 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.409
 it's a whole so yes this fracture of 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.990
 nose to find so seven white blocks 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.420
 here so I hid one in this 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.030
 sphere that you see here so it's from 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 this fact it is filled with minerals it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.760
 there is iron and coal 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.490
 no diamonds or gold or anything 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.170
 else there are trees etc we there are 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 everything you need to survive well 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.730
 will say so when you will have found the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.900
 first actor of the desert what I you 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.600
 advise to do it 20 sites you 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.230
 to bar the sphere in a few ways 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.090
 so be it here I propose you ipod 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.040
 taste of going out of the closed class 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.600
 here I am out so the sphere is 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 big enough as we can see then 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 that if I tell you to see from afar then 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.060
 I go out by the Koran it's just 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 because now I do not want to 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.390
 to denature the room by making a big 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.270
 hole by hand then we will go back ok 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.260
 so what does it look like far away yeah 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 it's nice it's true that I had not 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.280
 look too much but it's true it's 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.260
 nice but knowingly well so I you 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 explains the rest of the map this is the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.650
 port thing of a pc map so simple 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.989
 with caves and so it's beautiful gdr 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.170
 time and so on caves to know that 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.630
 the pumpkins have been replaced by d 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.950
 here is the next update the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.110
 pumpkins will be added for those who 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.280
 do not know yes it's true that in the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.180
 area for the three ears so not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.190
 bad news so the rectors 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.610
 of an error are my pills in any 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.890
 the map 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.720
 so I'm just going to show you one 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.370
 only to show you as in 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.110
 what conditions they can be 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.300
 hidden so I'll try to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.709
 show also so then reach you 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.080
 back under the sphere and you 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.310
 see a very small body of water is normal 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.870
 online in the thief is so there you 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.700
 in planes and of course you can the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.519
 twink who with a pickaxe make 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 normally that's it if I'm not wrong 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.610
 picking up doing that works after i 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.280
 never told her that jean-pierre but 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.440
 adapt to market too for that so 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.080
 now you have at least one reactor 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.700
 of an error and bombay the wood we have more 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.340
 only 5 to find on the map 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.620
 and there is one left in the sphere so 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.420
 that's it for the map actually I made the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.489
 sphere with ibm was obviously said 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.480
 because otherwise it's just impossible 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.220
 to make a good picture here exactly 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.530
 and so the interior has been filled to the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.970
 hand by month so that's it it's not 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.720
 extraordinary but it took me a long time 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.510
 what I'm not proud of normal but there is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.250
 walls in some places the walls 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.650
 big die right bada on the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.670
 east coast of the map 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.600
 that's it I'm not going to be the four 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.970
 sides but this one there is a wall 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.350
 I will always be mountains ah 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.170
 yeah shit indeed yes I have I got 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.560
 deceived one beats good discovery of ta 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 good door is not very very serious 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.840
 it's just a little disgusting 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.250
 that's what it says girl what she's going 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.340
 to support it we know allowed to find 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.829
 mining and riad and there are coal 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.690
 it's cheating we'll see the good 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.190
 side of things a good I hold when 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.650
 even to say that when we are not a 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.030
 mappers team we just do that because 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.709
 that he is like bored and I bac 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.450
 and the map did you say it mali y 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.500
 stick as you stuck in the embankment 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.860
 maybe not pick the right one 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.169
 mom yeah 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.690
 in short I try to fix it later 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.210
 we will say that this is the version one 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.620
 maybe cheat me another version 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.630
 then why not after the heroine remakes 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.120
 morning little malek several spheres 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.330
 I just spoiler a delay of a 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.289
 hour it m idem on the mountain water 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.940
 you yeah bah ditto 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.280
 Okay, we will not go too far 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.849
 in here we flew very high like that 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.970
 will not see my case there are melons west 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.849
 his stylist in that they think they 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.560
 consider regarding the lantern 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.330
 de kingdom we had planned as long as we 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.840
 is together end with him as much 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.060
 speak it's true so if you want to talk 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.669
 from him and so we had planned to do 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.440
 a 3v 3 so with all the team smarties 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.720
 against the opinion popcorn his skill helix 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.099
 unfortunately but it turns out that 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.690
 during these holidays will take a 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.009
 week the cost is not there and the other 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.690
 week is millennium that is not there 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.500
 so suddenly we can not do the fallen 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.699
 kingdom during the holidays in 3d 3 at 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.169
 king when it's almost impossible 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.380
 for everyone so we decided to 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.300
 do it in 2 against 2 so crunch line 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.240
 is she playing against me 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.030
 fear table and me here and we brake 3v 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.370
 3 soon in a few months I 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.099
 so think of course regain what we 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.500
 is too strong of course there we will win 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.630
 we will break it exactly the opposite by 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.159
 and I hope you like it 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.590
 here I hope also that the mac you 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.550
 will please despite the energy problem of the wall 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.560
 but it's not very serious 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.139
 wen have I will fix that you 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.190
 do not worry about subscribers so you 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.490
 can also visit the 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.930
 caves 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.539
 there are a lot of resources from childhood 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.070
 you prefer a series I mean 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.469
 your adventure cost as usual 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.479
 what short to change that can be a 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.099
 map survival but with a few small 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.030
 more wrinkles it can change usually 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.169
 for those who are fed up with maps 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.419
 classic survival sees the bomba on this one 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.669
 everything said the video is going to be relatively 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.719
 short but good and not so much 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.919
 things to say on this map 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.659
 and then here is especially not necessary no 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.460
 more to visit to discover the 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:28.050
 reactors so here are the links 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.979
 according to the description finally the link 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.039
 since it is not a water table 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.690
 it's the sigma only survival yes that 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.860
 it's really successful so if you 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.039
 want to download the map it's in the 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.039
 description 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.870
 I hope you like it and that the 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.520
 video you liked it too 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.780
 so to know that all the 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.890
 thumbnails of the maps were made 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.540
 the same skin of the word crémant 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.240
 I want to clarify all that 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.100
 was never specified it's all 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.330
 time him who did the thumbnails and 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.610
 we will have the same two anyway 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.240
 since yes as usual dogs 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.240
 big fenice the flame to do it here 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.410
 that's saying good on what we say 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.180
 more and then we will end up for a 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.830
 next video surely on the fallen 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.670
 king com here and the must kingdom 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.190
 for those who want to know 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.970
 it will normally start on Saturday the 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.230
 week of the autumn 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.820
 so if we go back on the 4th it's Saturday 9th 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.950
 if I say no nonsense so Saturday 9 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.830
 November 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.120
 that's what we wanted 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.920
 I hope you will be many appointments 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.000
 we will film you both so it 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.130
 can be nice to see both 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.170
 points of view also so will not be 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.170
 necessarily the same thing all the time 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.640
 so that's all we're going to 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.410
 leave then I hope this video 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.970
 you will have enjoyed it exactly here 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.650
 do not hesitate to tell us your feedback
