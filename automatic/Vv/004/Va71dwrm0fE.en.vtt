snowmaking capacity power and staff it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950 
snowmaking capacity power and staff it's
a<00:00:25.650> thorough<00:00:25.830> process<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> more<00:00:27.720> water

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a thorough process so the more water

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
a thorough process so the more water
that<00:00:28.109> gets<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> resort<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.910> more

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that gets up around the resort the more

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
that gets up around the resort the more
snow<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:30.960> capacity<00:00:31.740> let's<00:00:32.130> increase

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
snow we can make capacity let's increase

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
snow we can make capacity let's increase
they<00:00:32.850> did<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> 25<00:00:34.079> percent<00:00:34.260> how<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:34.980> do

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
they did up to 25 percent how do they do

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.910 
they did up to 25 percent how do they do
that<00:00:35.360> well<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.960> took<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.739> pipe

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that well they took out the little pipe

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
that well they took out the little pipe
and<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> big<00:00:39.540> pipe<00:00:42.140> it's<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and they put in a big pipe it's about it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
and they put in a big pipe it's about it
now<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> waters<00:00:44.550> flowing<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now that the waters flowing they had to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
now that the waters flowing they had to
get<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:45.899> shiny<00:00:46.410> new<00:00:46.800> snow<00:00:47.070> guns<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
get some of these shiny new snow guns I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
get some of these shiny new snow guns I
met<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.360> Penn<00:00:48.899> Gator<00:00:49.230> slope<00:00:49.860> director

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
met up with Penn Gator slope director

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
met up with Penn Gator slope director
here<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.610> snowshoe<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.960> front<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.320> shaver

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
here at snowshoe in front of the shaver

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
here at snowshoe in front of the shaver
center<00:00:52.949> he<00:00:53.520> gave<00:00:53.699> me<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.000> rundown<00:00:54.180> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
center he gave me a little rundown on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.549 
center he gave me a little rundown on
this<00:00:55.379> beast<00:00:55.620> behind<00:00:55.890> me<00:00:56.250> tell<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:57.000> about

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
this beast behind me tell me about

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.880 
this beast behind me tell me about
that's<00:00:58.559> no<00:00:58.920> good<00:00:59.329> that's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.510> brand<00:01:00.750> new<00:01:00.989> demo

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that's no good that's a brand new demo

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
that's no good that's a brand new demo
machine<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.489> we've<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.149> techno

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
machine that we've got from techno

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
machine that we've got from techno
elephant<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> huge<00:01:04.860> throw<00:01:05.369> which<00:01:05.610> means

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
elephant we got a huge throw which means

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
elephant we got a huge throw which means
it<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.150> pitch<00:01:06.450> snow<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> long<00:01:07.380> long<00:01:07.680> way

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it could pitch snow for a long long way

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030 
it could pitch snow for a long long way
and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:08.970> been<00:01:09.630> invented<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.860> see

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and it has been invented as you can see

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
and it has been invented as you can see
in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> ring<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.869> able<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.260> push

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
in the ring there so it's able to push

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950 
in the ring there so it's able to push
out<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.070> would<00:01:14.340> say<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.299> 200

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
out I would say probably about 200

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
out I would say probably about 200
gallons<00:01:16.320> per<00:01:16.500> minute<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.400> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
gallons per minute of water it was just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
gallons per minute of water it was just
huge<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:18.360> bigger<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.630> anything<00:01:18.990> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
huge probably bigger than anything we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350 
huge probably bigger than anything we
have<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.500> place<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> cuz<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.970> shiny

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have in place I like it cuz it's shiny

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.870 
have in place I like it cuz it's shiny
so<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.900> capacity<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> snow<00:01:23.369> making<00:01:23.580> power

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
so that's capacity and snow making power

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
so that's capacity and snow making power
but<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.479> happens<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> temperatures

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
but what happens if the temperatures

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 
but what happens if the temperatures
aren't<00:01:25.530> cooperating<00:01:26.540> they<00:01:27.540> thought<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
aren't cooperating they thought of that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.390 
aren't cooperating they thought of that
to<00:01:28.350> enter<00:01:29.070> snow<00:01:29.640> max<00:01:30.049> go<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> mass<00:01:31.470> snow

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to enter snow max go to the mass snow

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.420 
to enter snow max go to the mass snow
man<00:01:32.750> there's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.020> intricate<00:01:34.500> scientific

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
man there's a very intricate scientific

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
man there's a very intricate scientific
explanation<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.119> snow<00:01:36.270> max<00:01:36.479> who<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:37.049> not

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
explanation for snow max who we're not

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.789 
explanation for snow max who we're not
gonna<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
gonna do that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.530 
gonna do that
let's<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.340> say<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.700> protein<00:01:39.150> powder<00:01:39.420> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
let's just say it's protein powder for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
let's just say it's protein powder for
snow<00:01:39.810> guys<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.189> all<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
snow guys so all in all they up the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.749 
snow guys so all in all they up the
water<00:01:41.970> capacity<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> power<00:01:43.799> both<00:01:44.340> on

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
water capacity they up the power both on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
water capacity they up the power both on
the<00:01:44.970> slopes<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> gym

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the slopes and in the gym

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
the slopes and in the gym
and<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.570> insurance<00:01:48.720> policy

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and they have a little insurance policy

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
and they have a little insurance policy
with<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.800> snow<00:01:50.040> max<00:01:50.280> protein<00:01:50.760> shake<00:01:51.330> where's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
with that snow max protein shake where's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
with that snow max protein shake where's
it's<00:01:51.840> no<00:01:51.960> good<00:01:52.130> sounds<00:01:53.130> delicious<00:01:53.430> we're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's no good sounds delicious we're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's no good sounds delicious we're
gonna<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.510> more<00:01:54.900> snow<00:01:55.320> earlier<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
gonna make more snow earlier in the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
gonna make more snow earlier in the
season<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.479> potential<00:01:58.229> marginal

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
season and in potential marginal

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
season and in potential marginal
temperatures<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.280> here's<00:01:59.490> hoping<00:01:59.670> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
temperatures but here's hoping that
