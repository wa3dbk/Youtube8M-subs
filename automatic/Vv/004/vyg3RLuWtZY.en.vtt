very smoothly it is nice so maybe it's
not<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.739> bad<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.780> put<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> apple<00:00:43.140> sticker<00:00:43.559> on

not that bad I put the apple sticker on

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
not that bad I put the apple sticker on
it<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.670> had<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.149> hundred<00:00:45.559> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it just because I had all hundred so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.889 
it just because I had all hundred so
let's<00:00:46.710> open<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.399> what's<00:00:48.090> inside

all<00:00:51.899> right<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.289> guess<00:00:53.219> when<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.180> bad

all right I guess when we go the bad

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
all right I guess when we go the bad
news<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.050> runs<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.860> windows<00:00:56.160> ce<00:00:56.340> e<00:00:56.370> which
