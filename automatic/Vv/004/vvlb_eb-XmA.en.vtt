the magic bullets going to need some
water<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.400> happen<00:01:35.670> Melissa<00:01:36.799> I'm

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
water to make this happen Melissa I'm

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.120 
water to make this happen Melissa I'm
pretty<00:01:38.130> sure<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.150> we'll<00:01:39.390> give<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.750> go

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.340 

yeah<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.369> sure<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:49.510> all<00:01:50.510> right<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.110> also

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
yeah it sure is all right so this also

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.850 
yeah it sure is all right so this also
calls<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.759> third<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.240> cup<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.450> water<00:01:53.860> so

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
calls for a third of a cup of water so

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.260 
calls for a third of a cup of water so
I'm<00:01:55.100> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.280> go<00:01:55.430> ahead<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.790> put<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:55.940> in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
right away and at this point I think I'm

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.020 
right away and at this point I think I'm
just<00:01:59.570> going<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.930> go<00:01:59.990> ahead<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.409> put<00:02:00.800> all<00:02:01.670> the

just going to go ahead and put all the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.389 
just going to go ahead and put all the
ingredients<00:02:02.060> n<00:02:02.780> because<00:02:03.530> eventually<00:02:04.009> they're

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
ingredients n because eventually they're

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.630 
ingredients n because eventually they're
going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.000> blend<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.310> two

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
going to have to blend up so we have two

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
going to have to blend up so we have two
tablespoons<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:09.340> tahini<00:02:10.340> which<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.630> sesame

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and it's really versatile and something
