00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
hey guys Laurie moon here and just like

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.339 
hey guys Laurie moon here and just like
the<00:00:10.679> French<00:00:10.950> server<00:00:11.490> EU<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.870> doing<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the French server EU is now doing the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.250 
the French server EU is now doing the
free<00:00:13.590> draws<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:15.269> think<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
free draws as well I think there's a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.590 
free draws as well I think there's a
code<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.830> get<00:00:16.949> 1000<00:00:17.490> Cruz<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:17.970> but

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
code that you can get 1000 Cruz for but

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
code that you can get 1000 Cruz for but
it's<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> same<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.710> didn't<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it's the same with what they didn't the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
it's the same with what they didn't the
French<00:00:20.520> server<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.390> got<00:00:21.720> 1000<00:00:22.199> Cruz

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
French server where you got 1000 Cruz

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.580 
French server where you got 1000 Cruz
but<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:22.710> only<00:00:22.859> able<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.310> use<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:24.140> once<00:00:25.140> you

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
but you are only able to use it once you

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
but you are only able to use it once you
had<00:00:25.920> purchase<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> Chris<00:00:27.119> first<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
had purchase and Chris first I have a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
had purchase and Chris first I have a
little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> quiz<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.750> remember

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
little bit of quiz on here I remember

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
little bit of quiz on here I remember
why<00:00:32.899> but<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> free<00:00:35.219> draw<00:00:35.399> they

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
why but this this is the free draw they

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
why but this this is the free draw they
have<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.290> they

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
have over here and as you can see they

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
have over here and as you can see they
have<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> accessory<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:38.940> have

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
have this accessory which we don't have

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.810 
have this accessory which we don't have
in<00:00:39.210> u.s.<00:00:39.600> yeah<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.670> that's<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
in u.s. yeah I don't think that's a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
in u.s. yeah I don't think that's a
weird<00:00:42.239> recolor<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> crab<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
weird recolor of the crab there's a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
weird recolor of the crab there's a
Gemini<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.500> accessories<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.649> are<00:00:46.770> probably

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
Gemini the accessories here are probably

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
Gemini the accessories here are probably
worse<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.329> they've<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.170> grabs

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
