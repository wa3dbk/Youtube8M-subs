need is a dial or digital voltmeter your
car<00:00:19.289> keys<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:21.380> some<00:00:22.380> alligator<00:00:22.859> clips<00:00:23.189> now

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
car keys and some alligator clips now

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 
car keys and some alligator clips now
the<00:00:23.550> alligator<00:00:24.210> clips<00:00:24.539> aren't<00:00:25.289> necessary<00:00:25.890> but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the alligator clips aren't necessary but

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.240 
the alligator clips aren't necessary but
it<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.550> makes<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> job<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.300> easier<00:00:28.250> so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it just makes the job a lot easier so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
it just makes the job a lot easier so
we're<00:00:29.519> gonna<00:00:29.609> take<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.510> alligator<00:00:30.929> clips<00:00:31.289> and

we're gonna take the alligator clips and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.660 
we're gonna take the alligator clips and
I'm<00:00:32.369> gonna<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.730> ahead<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> put<00:00:33.270> them<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
I'm gonna go ahead and put them on a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
I'm gonna go ahead and put them on a
negative<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> positive<00:00:36.410> just<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> bolts

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

getting a little bit of zap bitch and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.959 
getting a little bit of zap bitch and
we're<00:00:50.280> gonna<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:51.559> our<00:00:52.559> terminals<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.820> our

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
we're gonna take our terminals on our

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're gonna take our terminals on our
negative<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.480> positive<00:00:54.960> make<00:00:55.710> sure<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> hit

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
negative and positive make sure you hit

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
negative and positive make sure you hit
negative<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.370> positive

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
negative and then positive

volt meter just make sure that the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
volt meter just make sure that the
positive<00:01:14.040> doesn't<00:01:14.220> hit<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.460> frame<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.540> we're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
positive doesn't hit the frame and we're

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.980 
positive doesn't hit the frame and we're
gonna<00:01:15.990> set<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.590> voltage<00:01:17.510> it's<00:01:18.510> just<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.990> V

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
gonna set it to voltage it's just a V

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.830 
gonna set it to voltage it's just a V
you<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.440> here<00:01:23.450> that's<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.660> we're

ahead and turn the car on and we're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.230 
ahead and turn the car on and we're
gonna<00:01:42.510> be<00:01:42.720> looking<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.380> voltage<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
gonna be looking for a voltage of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
gonna be looking for a voltage of
thirteen<00:01:45.240> point<00:01:45.510> eight<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.990> fourteen<00:01:46.440> point

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
thirteen point eight to fourteen point

00:01:46.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
thirteen point eight to fourteen point
eight<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> let<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.510> go<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> vehicle

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.589 

now<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:11.009> should<00:02:11.220> fluctuate<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.909> little<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
now it should fluctuate a little bit it

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.350 
now it should fluctuate a little bit it
could<00:02:12.750> drop<00:02:13.019> down

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
could drop down

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
could drop down
go<00:02:14.450> back<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:15.470> bit

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
go back up just a little bit

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
go back up just a little bit
so<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.910> said<00:02:18.120> we're<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:18.930> looking<00:02:19.260> for

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
so like you said we're just looking for

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130 
so like you said we're just looking for
a<00:02:19.470> voltage<00:02:20.450> thirteen<00:02:21.450> point<00:02:21.750> eight<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
a voltage thirteen point eight to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
a voltage thirteen point eight to
fourteen<00:02:22.620> point<00:02:22.920> eight<00:02:23.010> volts<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.150> we're

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
fourteen point eight volts and we're

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
fourteen point eight volts and we're
with<00:02:24.990> inspect<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.740> now<00:02:25.940> now<00:02:26.940> I'm<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
with inspect right now now I'm going to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500 
with inspect right now now I'm going to
go<00:02:27.510> back<00:02:27.720> into<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> vehicle<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.670> turn<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.300> AC

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
go back into the vehicle and turn the AC

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280 
go back into the vehicle and turn the AC
on<00:02:30.830> full<00:02:31.830> blast<00:02:32.240> with<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> heater<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.960> turn

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
on full blast with the heater and turn

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.660 
on full blast with the heater and turn
my<00:02:34.410> headlights<00:02:34.890> on

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.790 

it's<00:02:38.030> gonna<00:02:38.210> drop<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.740> to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it's gonna drop and then it's going to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:56.980 
it's gonna drop and then it's going to
build<00:02:40.010> back<00:02:40.310> up<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.790> voltage

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.480 

as<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.740> can<00:02:57.860> see<00:02:58.130> right<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.200> 14.8

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.940 

we<00:03:02.580> want<00:03:03.120> within<00:03:03.540> thirteen<00:03:04.140> point<00:03:04.440> eight<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
we want within thirteen point eight to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.080 
we want within thirteen point eight to
fourteen<00:03:05.400> point

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
fourteen point

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.360 
fourteen point
so<00:03:06.660> there<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.020> goes<00:03:07.170> back<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.530> its<00:03:07.950> building

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
so there it goes back up its building

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.280 
so there it goes back up its building
bolting<00:03:08.730> again

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.940 

so<00:03:15.799> we're<00:03:16.010> at<00:03:16.159> about<00:03:16.340> fourteen<00:03:17.120> point

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
so we're at about fourteen point

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.130 
so we're at about fourteen point
thirteen<00:03:18.950> forty

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
thirteen forty
