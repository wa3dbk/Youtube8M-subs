00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I found a steering wheel for it up in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.770 
I found a steering wheel for it up in
the<00:01:36.329> shed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the shed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
the shed
it's<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.170> old<00:01:37.320> panzer<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.119> works<00:01:39.329> for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it's from my old panzer so it works for

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.210 
it's from my old panzer so it works for
now<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:41.009> bumper<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:42.259> all<00:01:43.259> welded<00:01:43.710> up

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.830 

and<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.460> steering<00:01:47.850> linkages<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.540> set

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and the steering linkages are all set

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.340 
and the steering linkages are all set
but<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.979> changing<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.350> different

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
but I'm gonna be changing this different

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
but I'm gonna be changing this different
we're<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.070> using<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> piece<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we're probably gonna be using a piece of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
we're probably gonna be using a piece of
square<00:01:53.820> stuck<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> ends<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:54.960> I'll

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
square stuck with the ends on it I'll

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.520 
square stuck with the ends on it I'll
weld<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> could<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
weld it up but if you could see when I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.459 
weld it up but if you could see when I
steer<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> has<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> lot<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> bend<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.170> don't

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
steer it has a lot of bend to it I don't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.630 
steer it has a lot of bend to it I don't
know<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> much

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
know if you can really see it that much

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.170 
know if you can really see it that much

wheels unless it's moving turn the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.680 
wheels unless it's moving turn the
engines<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.340> bad<00:02:11.580> together<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.209> all<00:02:12.390> set

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
engines all bad together that's all set

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.090 
engines all bad together that's all set
I<00:02:12.900> stuck<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> little<00:02:13.770> piece

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I stuck a little piece

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.560 
I stuck a little piece
the<00:02:14.160> foam<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.880> an<00:02:14.940> air<00:02:15.030> cleaner<00:02:15.180> for

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the foam in here for an air cleaner for

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.600 
the foam in here for an air cleaner for
now<00:02:15.690> because<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> air<00:02:17.280> cleaner

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
now because I don't have a air cleaner

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
now because I don't have a air cleaner
for<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.030> yet
