worked<00:05:03.120> very<00:05:03.180> hard<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.660> remove<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.410> lot<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.620> the

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
worked very hard to remove a lot of the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.110 
worked very hard to remove a lot of the
regionalisms<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.460> my<00:05:05.550> speech<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:05.850> that<00:05:06.090> I

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
regionalisms in my speech so that I

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.970 
regionalisms in my speech so that I
could<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.390> more<00:05:06.510> flexible<00:05:06.720> as<00:05:07.050> an<00:05:07.140> actor<00:05:07.440> and

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
could be more flexible as an actor and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.200 
could be more flexible as an actor and
what<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.190> didn't<00:05:08.490> know<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.790> I<00:05:08.910> was<00:05:09.090> making

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
what I didn't know is that I was making

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.880 
what I didn't know is that I was making
myself<00:05:09.450> on<00:05:09.750> castable<00:05:10.350> because<00:05:10.620> no<00:05:10.800> one

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
myself on castable because no one

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.100 
myself on castable because no one
believed<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.280> was<00:05:11.400> American<00:05:11.640> anymore<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.720> so

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
believed I was American anymore and so

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.540 
believed I was American anymore and so
it's<00:05:13.290> it's<00:05:13.500> very<00:05:13.590> funny<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.130> there's<00:05:14.340> been

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
it's it's very funny and there's been

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.650 
it's it's very funny and there's been
other<00:05:14.700> animation<00:05:15.120> shows<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.330> I've<00:05:15.480> done

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
other animation shows that I've done

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.850 
other animation shows that I've done
where<00:05:15.870> people<00:05:16.140> say<00:05:16.260> well<00:05:16.290> why<00:05:16.500> did<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.740> do

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
where people say well why did you do

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.440 
where people say well why did you do
that<00:05:16.980> character<00:05:17.370> with<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.520> British<00:05:17.820> accent<00:05:18.210> and

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
that character with a British accent and

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.020 
that character with a British accent and
I<00:05:18.870> was<00:05:19.020> just<00:05:19.170> using<00:05:19.350> my<00:05:19.620> normal<00:05:19.680> speech<00:05:20.610> and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
I was just using my normal speech and

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.630 
I was just using my normal speech and
it's<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.600> no<00:05:21.930> that's<00:05:22.230> not<00:05:22.530> British<00:05:23.280> you<00:05:23.460> want

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
it's just no that's not British you want

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.890 
it's just no that's not British you want
to<00:05:23.700> hear<00:05:23.790> British<00:05:24.000> listen<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.360> integra<00:05:24.750> that

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
to hear British listen to integra that

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.050 
to hear British listen to integra that
that's<00:05:25.350> British<00:05:25.740> what<00:05:26.280> I'm<00:05:26.400> doing<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.820> just

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
that's British what I'm doing is just

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.810 
that's British what I'm doing is just
sort<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.750> know<00:05:27.780> as<00:05:28.110> much<00:05:28.410> as<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.820> accent

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
sort of you know as much as I can accent

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.930 
sort of you know as much as I can accent
neutral<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.860> think<00:05:32.190> what<00:05:32.310> happens<00:05:32.640> then<00:05:32.790> is

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
neutral and I think what happens then is

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.020 
neutral and I think what happens then is
when<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.090> do<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.900> end<00:05:34.110> up<00:05:34.500> sounding<00:05:34.940> sort<00:05:35.940> of

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
when I do that I end up sounding sort of

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.240 
when I do that I end up sounding sort of
mid-atlantic<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:37.020> said<00:05:37.440> this<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:37.830> very<00:05:38.040> much

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
mid-atlantic I said this so very much

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.730 
mid-atlantic I said this so very much
not<00:05:38.760> not<00:05:39.240> quite<00:05:39.570> American<00:05:40.170> but<00:05:40.320> certainly<00:05:40.590> not

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
not not quite American but certainly not

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.560 
not not quite American but certainly not
British<00:05:41.160> so<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.370> little<00:05:41.700> more<00:05:41.940> elevated<00:05:42.390> a

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
British so a little more elevated a

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.300 
British so a little more elevated a
little<00:05:42.810> more<00:05:42.960> aristocratic<00:05:43.170> and<00:05:43.860> sure<00:05:44.280> enough

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
little more aristocratic and sure enough

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.700 
little more aristocratic and sure enough
that's<00:05:44.610> how<00:05:44.880> I<00:05:44.910> got<00:05:45.180> cast<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.750> lot<00:05:45.900> when<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.530> was

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
that's how I got cast a lot when I was

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.380 
that's how I got cast a lot when I was
doing<00:05:46.950> theatre<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.370> would<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.760> would<00:05:47.880> play<00:05:48.090> sort

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
doing theatre I would I would play sort

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.660 
doing theatre I would I would play sort
of<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.600> well-spoken<00:05:49.200> young<00:05:49.590> male<00:05:49.830> whether<00:05:50.550> it

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
of the well-spoken young male whether it

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.360 
of the well-spoken young male whether it
was<00:05:50.790> Hamlet<00:05:51.060> or<00:05:51.330> Dorian<00:05:51.630> Gray<00:05:51.840> or<00:05:51.990> whatever

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
was Hamlet or Dorian Gray or whatever

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.360 
was Hamlet or Dorian Gray or whatever
and<00:05:53.370> so<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:54.060> was<00:05:54.960> interesting<00:05:55.470> for<00:05:55.500> Alucard<00:05:56.280> to

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
and so it was interesting for Alucard to

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.770 
and so it was interesting for Alucard to
come<00:05:56.520> along<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:56.940> say<00:05:57.060> yes<00:05:57.300> he<00:05:57.540> is<00:05:57.660> an

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
come along and say yes he is an

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.170 
come along and say yes he is an
aristocrat<00:05:58.380> he's<00:05:58.590> he's<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.160> counter<00:05:59.790> dare<00:06:00.030> we

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
aristocrat he's he's a counter dare we

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.090 
aristocrat he's he's a counter dare we
say<00:06:00.420> and<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:02.100> so<00:06:02.430> he's<00:06:02.700> gonna<00:06:02.880> have<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.540> certain

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
say and and so he's gonna have a certain

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.670 
say and and so he's gonna have a certain
bearing<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.280> royalty<00:06:05.910> to<00:06:06.090> him<00:06:06.330> that<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.380> not

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
bearing and royalty to him that is not

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.770 
bearing and royalty to him that is not
it's<00:06:08.370> sort<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.670> tricky<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.030> find<00:06:09.390> in<00:06:09.660> an

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
it's sort of tricky to find in an

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.500 
it's sort of tricky to find in an
American<00:06:10.380> we<00:06:11.190> used<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.550> have<00:06:11.730> that<00:06:12.000> notion<00:06:12.240> of

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
American we used to have that notion of

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.530 
American we used to have that notion of
American<00:06:12.780> elegant<00:06:13.470> with<00:06:14.010> like<00:06:14.370> Joseph<00:06:15.120> Cotten

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
American elegant with like Joseph Cotten

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.110 
American elegant with like Joseph Cotten
possibly<00:06:16.110> back<00:06:16.350> in<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.590> day<00:06:16.800> and<00:06:17.070> in<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.550> 20s

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
possibly back in the day and in the 20s

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.000 
possibly back in the day and in the 20s
and<00:06:18.270> 30s<00:06:18.450> you<00:06:18.780> had<00:06:18.960> these<00:06:19.140> these<00:06:19.440> these<00:06:19.740> men

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
and 30s you had these these these men

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.520 
and 30s you had these these these men
who<00:06:20.220> are<00:06:20.310> American<00:06:20.790> elegant<00:06:21.210> but<00:06:21.720> after<00:06:22.410> the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
who are American elegant but after the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.140 
who are American elegant but after the
50s<00:06:22.920> I<00:06:23.010> think<00:06:23.040> that's<00:06:23.460> sort<00:06:23.670> of<00:06:23.700> very<00:06:23.760> out<00:06:24.030> of

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
50s I think that's sort of very out of

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.090 
50s I think that's sort of very out of
fashion<00:06:24.300> very<00:06:24.840> out<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.020> fashion<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:25.920> it's

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
fashion very out of fashion and so it's

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.250 
fashion very out of fashion and so it's
sort<00:06:26.220> of<00:06:26.340> tricky<00:06:26.700> to<00:06:26.730> find<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.540> find<00:06:27.570> that<00:06:27.990> and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
sort of tricky to find to find that and

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.530 
sort of tricky to find to find that and
I<00:06:28.380> was<00:06:28.560> just<00:06:28.710> happy<00:06:28.920> to<00:06:29.070> to<00:06:29.910> come<00:06:30.090> along<00:06:30.360> and

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
I was just happy to to come along and

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.750 
I was just happy to to come along and
have<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.720> look<00:06:30.870> hard<00:06:31.200> and<00:06:31.410> be<00:06:31.530> able<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:31.860> not<00:06:32.700> only

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
have a look hard and be able to not only

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.900 
have a look hard and be able to not only
give<00:06:33.090> him<00:06:33.420> that<00:06:33.930> sort<00:06:34.410> of<00:06:34.500> royalty<00:06:35.460> but<00:06:35.669> also

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
give him that sort of royalty but also

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.390 
give him that sort of royalty but also
give<00:06:36.300> him<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:37.169> depth<00:06:37.470> and<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.740> heaviness<00:06:38.100> to

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
give him the depth and the heaviness to
