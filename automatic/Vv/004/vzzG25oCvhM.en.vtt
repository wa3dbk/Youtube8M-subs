 the other exit from pm or the normal 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 everyone already knows is to connect the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.810
 this default neighbor plugin was voting 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.380

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.890
 here at the door and xp when you will send the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.900

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.180
 who will do what is lacking for 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.110
 to be able to feed now I'll have to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.090
 It will feed nothing, but in the case 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.130
 connected on the workbench is doing this 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.310
 but when you turn on your 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.959
 last author a single feed already 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.150
 will serve for everyone then you will 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.630
 to have these two feeds here is 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.900
 here and this you turn on the voice if you 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.019
 you want, you can cut this path 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.910
 left me and plugged it directly into the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.880
 I touched your engine 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.329
 So when I call you here, I'm ready. 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.359
 I fed pm and then the nasa 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.040
 She's already fed and here she can not 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.160
 see on camera but here I already have one 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.650
 doctor when the boy and led sd 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 It's blinking straight so it means that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.609
 everything is ok operating status 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.790
 and it is already working. 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.230
 sending the information to him the way 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.570
 here o 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.570
 I'll call pro 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.040

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.990
 I'll spend Mari left then monitor here 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:35.030
 Okay, I already have the information now 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.030
 of pleasure that I 'm going to show you 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.840
 Here's how I can do it. 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.070
 to realize ready here 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.540
 that's it 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.540
 besides what I am now 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:04.860
 to do when I move with the nasa already 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:07.529
 is acting oh let the camera off 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.709
 that you will be able to have a vision 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.709
 best 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:24.449
 now it 's there, you see it in the front 

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:25.379
 behind the show here where is the mode 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.809
 of flight 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:32.789
 the satellite positions that droops 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:36.179
 Are you going up or down speed? 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.419
 battery level you know is the height and 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:42.749
 distance from the departure point 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.989
 so it's here, it's all connected here 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:50.489
 for example, let us assume that the 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:51.569
 simulate that it is as if the camera had 

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:57.649
 here o 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:06:06.139
 I 'm here, just look at the camera here. 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:06.139
 I got here now ready 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:20.439
 there you need to see it better 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:20.439
 in this safe position and 7 5 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.529
 This is how I am seeing 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.479
 video 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:33.770
 look there so I'm here O 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.999
 so if you look at this bar here 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.499
 tilt to the right for 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.499
 left then look what happens 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.539
 event up and down is not 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.840
 Working perfectly 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:53.659
 so here now I left a witness 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:58.909
 here for you plug play is just arrive and 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:07:09.259
 call dismantling she does so he 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:11.889
 called here will not back now by 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:11.889
 stand 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:23.539
 I turned off the whole system here 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:28.399
 I will remove pm what is here 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:34.909
 along with the nasa and the camera was also 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:41.149
 gopro ready and got it here like this 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:44.629
 in addition to removing the connector from the 

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:50.240
 video output of girl and sd 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:52.899
 Thus, there is already a straight cable already 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.860
 finished and your receiver 

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:59.050
