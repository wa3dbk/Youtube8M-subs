00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 good you already made your forecast now we 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 Let's see what actually happens to us. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.270
 we put here the steel wool in the balance 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 is scoring here around 1 5 point 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.490
 9 grams 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 we will then set fire to the straw of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 steel and we are going to follow the mass here 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.469
 that happens 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.469
 you can already see that the brand is 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.469
 increasing 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.160
 as well as increases but the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.610
 So, is there something you're doing? 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.079
 that the mass of the steel straw increases 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 like what is happening is a reaction 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.329
 chemistry some reagent is coming together 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.760
 to an iron causing its mass 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.629
 increase but we did not sign anything straw 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 of steel 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.359
 then from where it came to be a reagent 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 burns in addition to the material is 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 what else we need we need 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 also of oxygen 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.780
 This even without oxygen does not have 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 combustion of the steel straw is a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.939
 iron reaction with air oxygen 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.860
 the product is a soil incorporates oxygen 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.820
 increase the mass of the scale 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 records based on the case of the paper 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 mass decreases 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.150
 in this mass failure of the case increases 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.860
 mass always varies is for us to know 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
 that's what we're going to do even more 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.009
 experiments 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.079
 So now what are we going to do? 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.970
 Here we'll take one tablet 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.030
 effervescent antacids 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 Let's put it in the water, it's just that we 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 Let's do this in two ways. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 different we are going to put here in this 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 weak first with the bottle open and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.110
 after repeated here with the bottle 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 always in the balance always watching the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.649
 what happens to the pasta is that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 but before we do this 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.600
 experiment in the closed system you already 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.570
 Do you want to know what your opinion is? 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 prediction if you think the mass of this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 reaction in the closed system will increase 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.530
 click the up arrow if you think 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.959
 that the mass will remain 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.459
 the same click in the square to the center but 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.630
 if you think that a closed system 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.090
 mass will decrease 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.959
 click the down arrow then no 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.940
 stop making your prediction and we 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.780
 we see in the next that will be the last 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.780
 video
