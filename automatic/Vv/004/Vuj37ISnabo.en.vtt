00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we're going to set it to false because

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.150

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this thing let's go ahead and make it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
this thing let's go ahead and make it
blue<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.260> something<00:01:05.150> we're<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> create

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
blue or something we're going to create

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.130 
blue or something we're going to create
a<00:01:06.600> rule<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> say<00:01:08.310> when

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
a rule here and we're going to say when

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.570 
a rule here and we're going to say when
touch<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.350> pressed<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:13.939> attribute<00:01:15.380> game

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
touch is pressed and attribute game

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.010 
touch is pressed and attribute game
destroy<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.240> false<00:01:20.479> we<00:01:21.479> want<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> change

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
destroy all is false we want to change

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.429 
destroy all is false we want to change
attribute<00:01:23.630> game<00:01:24.920> destroy<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.840> too<00:01:27.840> true<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
attribute game destroy all too true and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
attribute game destroy all too true and
the<00:01:28.829> reason<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.220> we're<00:01:29.400> adding<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> false<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the reason why we're adding the false in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350 
the reason why we're adding the false in
there<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:30.960> once<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.470> turn<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.360> once

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there is because once they turn it once

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
there is because once they turn it once
they<00:01:33.450> press<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> button<00:01:34.079> make<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> true<00:01:34.680> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
they press the button make it true we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.810 
they press the button make it true we
don't<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.159> them<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.460> able<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> keep

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
don't want them to be able to keep

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.530 
don't want them to be able to keep
pressing<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.759> we'll<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> keep<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
pressing it so we'll just keep it that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.889 
pressing it so we'll just keep it that
way<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.549> we're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:41.850> our<00:01:42.180> bad

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the reason for that is is we need to set

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.500 
the reason for that is is we need to set
the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
button we need to set it back to false

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.440 
button we need to set it back to false
so<00:02:19.099> what<00:02:19.730> we're<00:02:19.819> going<00:02:19.909> to<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.239> we're<00:02:20.360> going

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.860 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.659> timer<00:02:21.610> under<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.849> i'm<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.750> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to do a timer under here i'm going to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.600 
to do a timer under here i'm going to
say<00:02:24.019> after<00:02:26.620> 0.4<00:02:27.620> seconds<00:02:28.900> run<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.019> completion

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
say after 0.4 seconds run to completion

say after 0.4 seconds run to completion
we're<00:02:31.610> going<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.819> alt<00:02:32.629> copy<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.680> little

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
we're going to alt copy this little

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.640 
we're going to alt copy this little
behavior<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.269> into<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.140> we're<00:02:36.560> going

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
behavior here into here and we're going

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.949 
behavior here into here and we're going
to<00:02:36.709> say<00:02:36.860> false<00:02:37.299> we<00:02:38.299> could<00:02:38.390> probably<00:02:38.480> make<00:02:38.780> this

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
to say false we could probably make this

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.530 
to say false we could probably make this
as<00:02:39.200> 0.1<00:02:40.299> let's<00:02:41.299> just<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.569> 0.1<00:02:42.430> preview<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.640> so
