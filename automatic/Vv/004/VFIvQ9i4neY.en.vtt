into 3d parts this example I'm going to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.339 
into 3d parts this example I'm going to
show<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.599> begin<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.140> we

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
show you how to do that to begin with we

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.030 
show you how to do that to begin with we
move<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.890> insert<00:00:32.480> DWG<00:00:33.480> DXF<00:00:34.320> we're<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
move up to insert DWG DXF we're going to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.000 
move up to insert DWG DXF we're going to
bring<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> drawing<00:00:35.970> called<00:00:36.330> bracket<00:00:37.010> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bring in a drawing called bracket it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.660 
bring in a drawing called bracket it's
in<00:00:38.160> inch<00:00:38.430> units<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.089> we'll<00:00:39.269> click<00:00:39.570> OK<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
in inch units so we'll click OK on that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.460 
in inch units so we'll click OK on that
here's<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.850> drawing<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> first<00:00:42.690> step<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.199> to

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
here's our drawing the first step is to

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.500 
here's our drawing the first step is to
define<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> views<00:00:44.339> we're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.150> move<00:00:45.300> up

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
define the views we're going to move up

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
define the views we're going to move up
here<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.989> define<00:00:46.350> views<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
here to define views and I'm going to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
here to define views and I'm going to
start<00:00:47.699> off<00:00:47.940> by<00:00:48.350> defining<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.649> top<00:00:49.980> view<00:00:50.989> I'll

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
start off by defining a top view I'll

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
start off by defining a top view I'll
simply<00:00:52.500> draw<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> box<00:00:53.129> around<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
simply draw a box around that and that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.069 
simply draw a box around that and that
will<00:00:54.390> become<00:00:54.570> our<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:55.199> view<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.829> example

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
will become our top view in this example

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
will become our top view in this example
next<00:00:58.079> I'll<00:00:58.230> define<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.860> front<00:00:59.190> view<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:03.110> then

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
next I'll define the front view and then

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.210 
next I'll define the front view and then
we'll<00:01:04.289> define<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.800> right<00:01:04.979> side<00:01:05.339> view

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.370 

once<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.090> views<00:01:10.300> are<00:01:10.420> define<00:01:10.780> we<00:01:11.020> click

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
once the views are define we click

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.090 
once the views are define we click
create<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:12.190> then<00:01:12.720> we'll<00:01:13.720> click<00:01:13.930> close<00:01:14.350> now

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
create and then we'll click close now

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.070 
create and then we'll click close now
we've<00:01:15.340> got<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.550> top<00:01:15.910> front<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.600> right<00:01:16.780> side

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
we've got a top front and right side

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.830 
we've got a top front and right side
view<00:01:17.520> next<00:01:18.520> we're<00:01:18.760> going<00:01:18.910> to<00:01:19.180> chain<00:01:19.570> the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
view next we're going to chain the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.040 
view next we're going to chain the
perimeter<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:21.070> views<00:01:21.370> in<00:01:21.730> each<00:01:21.880> view<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
perimeter of the views in each view to

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.770 
perimeter of the views in each view to
create<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> 3d<00:01:23.590> Park<00:01:24.100> we'll<00:01:25.000> go<00:01:25.120> down<00:01:25.300> here<00:01:25.330> to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
create the 3d Park we'll go down here to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.830 
create the 3d Park we'll go down here to
auto<00:01:26.050> loop<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.800> I'm<00:01:27.160> going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.520> click<00:01:28.510> on<00:01:28.690> the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
auto loop and I'm going to click on the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.450 
auto loop and I'm going to click on the
perimeter<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.800> each<00:01:30.040> view<00:01:32.010> there's<00:01:33.010> our<00:01:33.220> top

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
perimeter in each view there's our top

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.050 
perimeter in each view there's our top
view<00:01:34.020> chain<00:01:35.020> our<00:01:35.200> front<00:01:35.470> view<00:01:35.760> then<00:01:36.760> we'll<00:01:36.940> go

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
view chain our front view then we'll go

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.000 
view chain our front view then we'll go
over<00:01:37.180> here<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.780> right<00:01:38.080> side<00:01:38.110> view<00:01:38.830> and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
over here to the right side view and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.840 
over here to the right side view and
define<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:41.010> once<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.190> perimeter<00:01:42.580> has<00:01:42.790> been

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
define that once the perimeter has been

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
define that once the perimeter has been
defined<00:01:43.510> we<00:01:43.900> go<00:01:44.080> up<00:01:44.260> to<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.950> gear<00:01:45.310> shaped<00:01:45.610> icon

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
defined we go up to the gear shaped icon

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.940 
defined we go up to the gear shaped icon
auto<00:01:48.130> feature<00:01:48.580> click<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.950> there's

auto feature click on that and there's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.490 
auto feature click on that and there's
our<00:01:51.130> part<00:01:51.550> then<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.270> expand<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.900> window<00:01:53.140> here

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
our part then to expand this window here

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.490 
our part then to expand this window here
so<00:01:53.530> we<00:01:53.800> can<00:01:53.950> see<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.280> little<00:01:54.310> more<00:01:54.640> clearly

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.070 

and<00:02:00.130> we'll<00:02:00.370> switch<00:02:00.970> views<00:02:01.300> so<00:02:01.510> we<00:02:01.540> can<00:02:01.780> see<00:02:01.960> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
and we'll switch views so we can see the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.040 
and we'll switch views so we can see the
entire<00:02:02.200> part<00:02:02.800> we'll<00:02:03.190> just<00:02:03.370> go<00:02:03.490> into<00:02:03.700> a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
entire part we'll just go into a

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.249 
entire part we'll just go into a
isometric<00:02:05.050> view<00:02:06.930> fit<00:02:07.930> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
isometric view fit it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.000 
isometric view fit it
there's<00:02:09.009> our<00:02:09.190> part<00:02:09.490> from<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.850> 2d<00:02:10.390> drawing<00:02:11.010> got

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
there's our part from a 2d drawing got

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.620 
there's our part from a 2d drawing got
some<00:02:12.220> more<00:02:12.340> work<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.610> do<00:02:12.910> on<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.120> though

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
some more work to do on it though

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.470 
some more work to do on it though
so<00:02:13.810> we're<00:02:14.020> going<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> do<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> holes<00:02:15.370> next<00:02:15.790> for

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
so we're going to do the holes next for

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.090 
so we're going to do the holes next for
holes<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.960> are<00:02:17.020> shown<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.590> top<00:02:17.800> view

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
holes that are shown in the top view

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.170 
holes that are shown in the top view
we'll<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.330> similar<00:02:19.540> way<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.940> going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
we'll do it in a similar way I'm going

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.990 
we'll do it in a similar way I'm going
to<00:02:22.390> click<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.320> four<00:02:24.130> pieces<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.700> geometry

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
to click on the four pieces of geometry

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.690 
to click on the four pieces of geometry
that<00:02:25.600> define<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> holes<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:27.430> time

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
that define the holes but this time

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.370 
that define the holes but this time
we're<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.120> tell<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.720> want<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
we're going to tell it that we want to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.410 
we're going to tell it that we want to
extrude<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.220> cut<00:02:30.430> completely<00:02:30.820> through<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
extrude a cut completely through the
