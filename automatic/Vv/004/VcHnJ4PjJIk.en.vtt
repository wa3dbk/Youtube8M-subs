little longer but it does look natural
still<00:01:32.990> yeah<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.130> definitely<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.759> get

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
still yeah so you definitely could get

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.539 
still yeah so you definitely could get
away<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.619> seen<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.369> many

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
away with one but I've seen so many

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
away with one but I've seen so many
reviews<00:01:39.030> where<00:01:39.240> everyone<00:01:39.600> has<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> side<00:01:40.380> part

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
reviews where everyone has the side part

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
reviews where everyone has the side part
and<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> clippings

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and that's because the way the clippings

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
and that's because the way the clippings
are<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> full

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.469 
are it's really hard to get a full
install<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.880> middle<00:01:48.240> part

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
