proto<00:01:33.930> Drake<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.500> pretty<00:01:34.650> worthwhile

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
proto Drake so it's pretty worthwhile

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
proto Drake so it's pretty worthwhile
going<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> doing<00:01:36.180> rare<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.020> guide

going and doing rare the or guide
pinnacle<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> still<00:01:38.340> need<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:40.170> we're

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
pinnacle if you still need it so we're

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
pinnacle if you still need it so we're
just<00:01:40.290> gonna<00:01:40.439> burn<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> trash<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
just gonna burn through the trash and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
just gonna burn through the trash and
basically<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.420> achievement<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.680> kill<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
basically the achievement is to kill the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
basically the achievement is to kill the
boss<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.930> destroying<00:01:46.350> any<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
frozen to our frost oons now it'll be

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
frozen to our frost oons now it'll be
put<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> random<00:01:49.560> player<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.250> gets<00:01:50.430> cast

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
put on a random player it gets cast

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.060 
put on a random player it gets cast
every<00:01:51.240> once<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.750> while<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.829> very

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
every once in a while and not very

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
every once in a while and not very
frequently<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.790> guess<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> random

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
frequently I guess put on a random

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.910 
frequently I guess put on a random
player<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.439> own<00:01:55.530> it'll<00:01:55.770> be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
player if you're on your own it'll be

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240 
player if you're on your own it'll be
obviously<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.430> targeted<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
obviously be targeted on you and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.530 
obviously be targeted on you and
basically<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.759> break<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> frost

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
basically it's to not break the frost

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
basically it's to not break the frost
tomb<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> any<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.189> make<00:02:02.700> sure<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.909> don't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
tomb in any way so make sure you don't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
tomb in any way so make sure you don't
have<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> pet<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:04.079> attacking<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
have a pet that's gonna be attacking it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.609 
have a pet that's gonna be attacking it
none<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:06.479> has<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> 20<00:02:07.229> second

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
none of that and it has a 20 second

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
none of that and it has a 20 second
duration<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.310> literally<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:08.970> sit<00:02:09.360> inside

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
duration so literally just sit inside

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.300 
duration so literally just sit inside
the<00:02:09.840> frost<00:02:10.080> tomb<00:02:10.289> wait<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> break<00:02:11.099> on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the frost tomb wait for it to break on

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
the frost tomb wait for it to break on
its<00:02:11.430> own<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> then<00:02:11.970> kill<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> boss<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.780> not

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
its own and then kill the boss do not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.820 
its own and then kill the boss do not
break<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> yourself

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
break it yourself

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.390 
break it yourself
now<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.750> problem<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.560> level<00:02:16.860> 90<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.280> have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
now the problem is at level 90 you have

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
now the problem is at level 90 you have
a<00:02:17.430> high<00:02:17.700> chance<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.090> actually<00:02:18.270> resistant<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
a high chance of actually resistant the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
a high chance of actually resistant the
ability<00:02:19.560> altogether<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.300> what

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
ability altogether and this is what

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.270 
ability altogether and this is what
happens<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.050> video<00:02:22.320> now<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:22.800> apparently

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
happens in this video now now apparently

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.040 
happens in this video now now apparently
resistant<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> still<00:02:24.270> does<00:02:24.450> count<00:02:24.690> towards

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
resistant it still does count towards

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.540 
resistant it still does count towards
the<00:02:25.110> achievement<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.800> I'm<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.070> too<00:02:26.280> sure

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the achievement but I'm not too sure

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.050 
the achievement but I'm not too sure
about<00:02:26.700> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
about that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.180 
about that
so<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.170> unsure<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.710> know<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.010> don't

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
so if you're unsure you know you don't

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.920 
so if you're unsure you know you don't
want<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> take<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.700> risk<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.570> keep<00:02:30.750> wait

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
want to take the risk and just keep wait

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.300 
want to take the risk and just keep wait
until<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:31.410> cast<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.130> that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
until they actually cast one that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.490 
until they actually cast one that
successfully<00:02:32.910> lands<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.570> with<00:02:34.230> sitting

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
successfully lands on you with sitting

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080 
successfully lands on you with sitting
this<00:02:34.620> across<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.040> him<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.280> 20<00:02:35.490> seconds<00:02:35.880> wait

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
this across to him for 20 seconds wait

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
this across to him for 20 seconds wait
for<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.480> basically<00:02:36.840> tick<00:02:37.290> off<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.620> its<00:02:37.770> own

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
for it to basically tick off on its own

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.520 
for it to basically tick off on its own
and<00:02:38.220> then<00:02:38.970> kill<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> boss<00:02:39.630> once<00:02:40.080> you've<00:02:40.350> had

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and then kill the boss once you've had

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.440 
and then kill the boss once you've had
like<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> full<00:02:41.280> duration<00:02:41.490> frost<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.060> him<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.300> out

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
like a full duration frost to him go out

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.640 
like a full duration frost to him go out
then<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.380> literally<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:45.530> complete<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
then you can literally just complete the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.810 
then you can literally just complete the
achievement<00:02:47.070> now<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.250> not<00:02:47.370> too<00:02:47.520> sure<00:02:47.700> if

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
achievement now I'm not too sure if

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.370 
achievement now I'm not too sure if
killing<00:02:48.150> him<00:02:48.240> before<00:02:48.360> he<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:48.900> puts<00:02:49.290> a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
killing him before he actually puts a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.290 
killing him before he actually puts a
frost<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.770> mount<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.130> count<00:02:50.400> either<00:02:50.670> those

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
frost to mount will count either those

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.699 
frost to mount will count either those
things<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.750> haven't<00:02:52.110> tested<00:02:52.260> because

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
things that I haven't tested because

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.810 
things that I haven't tested because
I've<00:02:52.800> already<00:02:52.920> got<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.250> achievement<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
I've already got the achievement so I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.449 
I've already got the achievement so I
can't<00:02:54.090> find<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:55.290> you're<00:02:55.920> welcome<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.250> try

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
can't find out but you're welcome to try

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.980 
can't find out but you're welcome to try
and<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> doesn't<00:02:57.030> work<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:57.660> come

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and if it doesn't work you can just come

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.750 
and if it doesn't work you can just come
back<00:02:58.020> tomorrow<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.560> GC<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:58.920> casted<00:02:59.340> Frost<00:02:59.580> tomb

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
back tomorrow a GC is casted Frost tomb

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.220 
back tomorrow a GC is casted Frost tomb
but<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> completely<00:03:00.360> resist<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.020> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
but I completely resist it and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.310

unfortunately<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> doesn't<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
unfortunately it doesn't do it so up to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.270 
unfortunately it doesn't do it so up to
you<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.680> take<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> risk<00:03:05.160> of

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
you if you want to take the risk of
