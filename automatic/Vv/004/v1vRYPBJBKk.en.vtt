00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
same I guys have put the same I on the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.710 
same I guys have put the same I on the
same<00:02:18.290> events<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:19.730> those<00:02:20.000> three<00:02:20.180> Gospels

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
same events and so those three Gospels

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.270 
same events and so those three Gospels
were<00:02:20.840> written<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:21.230> eyewitness<00:02:21.650> accounts<00:02:21.980> John

were written as eyewitness accounts John

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.649 
were written as eyewitness accounts John
was<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:22.700> John<00:02:22.879> was<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.269> latest

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
was that John was one of the latest

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.320 
was that John was one of the latest

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.390 
comes along and John wants to take the
same<00:02:32.420> story<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:32.930> he<00:02:33.080> wants<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.349> write<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.799> with

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
same story but he wants to write it with

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.930 
same story but he wants to write it with
a<00:02:34.430> view<00:02:34.849> toward<00:02:35.739> why<00:02:36.739> this<00:02:36.799> Jesus<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.790> so

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
a view toward why this Jesus is so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940 
a view toward why this Jesus is so
significant<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.170> he's<00:02:39.319> really<00:02:39.560> trying<00:02:39.709> to

humankind<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> earth<00:03:03.829> as<00:03:04.010> we<00:03:04.129> know<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.430> was

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
humankind on the earth as we know it was

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.650 
humankind on the earth as we know it was
not<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.849> very<00:03:05.000> first<00:03:05.209> part<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.480> God's

not the very first part of God's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.390 
not the very first part of God's
creation<00:03:05.900> there's<00:03:06.530> something<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:06.859> predates

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
creation there's something that predates

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.979

that<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:08.030> was<00:03:08.180> God's<00:03:08.390> creation<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that it was God's creation of the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.039 
that it was God's creation of the
angelic<00:03:09.530> realm<00:03:09.799> which<00:03:10.190> even<00:03:10.459> explains<00:03:10.989> how<00:03:11.989> we

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
angelic realm which even explains how we

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.380 
angelic realm which even explains how we
had<00:03:12.410> an<00:03:12.530> enemy<00:03:12.890> here<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.239> very

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
had an enemy here from the very

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.849 
had an enemy here from the very
beginning<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> think<00:03:15.109> I'd<00:03:15.230> probably<00:03:15.410> say
