00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.999
 the agreement of potatoes always potatoes 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.009
 what do you say I live 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.340
 no I chose perfect no question of injecting see 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.289
 give up sweet potatoes sir nicolas hulot international player art 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.520
 they all participated in six months the attackers of the peru canton of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 marcigny and even tomatoes from the president 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.450
 this aid is paid 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 jeans 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.670
 it is then the children 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.690
 you what was it why there are so vegetables at this time of the year 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.620
 on my stall 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 it's because these diverse and at this season one needs to prepare the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.220
 defenses of our body with for example kiwis and lemons that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.150
 are full of vitamins or with skates to cabbage and carrots 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.880
 leave the camp 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.640
 yes if we really need it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780
 in winter we activate much more of the four bodies to fight against the cold 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.280
 and on the contrary we were the hot entity our body needs water 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 that's why the fruits and vegetables of this period are soaked 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.250
 water 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.240
 tomatoes cucumbers strawberries intruder 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 why in the other direction this Australian press 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.470
 because in australia this summer 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.160
 with us at this time of year our body does not need to do 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.610
 evolve but this for you 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.570
 Cecile Cau 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.160
 we can not or not 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.980
 yes and then he makes strawberries come back from australia it's a hit so hello 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 CO2 emissions to satisfy our little pucks 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 just another thing 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 why your neighbor they sell that suddenly 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.340
 Well, it's because they do not respect the cycle of plants 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.500
 you see who I want to grow strawberries in winter there is a lot less 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 brightness when one was suddenly he must artificially bring what 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.709
 they need to grow fertilizer it's a show done and it was rare 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.029
 it's a lot of energy consumption to have strawberries 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.679
 finally bland fruits and vegetables that grow naturally well 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.679
 better taste they have a lot more nutritional qualities 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 on arrival in new york and strawberry ripening under the summer sun 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.579
 anyway the highest always been better than the winter 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.069
 now people are used to eating strawberries any tomatoes 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.519
 year 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.760
 because of that our various vegetables like celery or Brussels sprouts 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.179
 are selling less and as these profitable months we produce almost more 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.899
 you are right must be responsible 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.739
 what do you think of cities in France in the summer and advise their 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.229
 offers in australia launched summer 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 I think you think too much 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.679
 1 m 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.839
 I just love it
