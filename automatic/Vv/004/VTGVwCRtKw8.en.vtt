organic<00:03:50.440> /<00:03:50.830> conventionally<00:03:51.460> grown<00:03:51.520> food<00:03:51.910> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
organic / conventionally grown food and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.140 
organic / conventionally grown food and
why<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.690> but<00:03:53.470> I'm<00:03:53.820> getting<00:03:54.820> more<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.060> more

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
why I do but I'm getting more and more

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.820 
why I do but I'm getting more and more
schooled<00:03:55.570> on<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.110> feel<00:03:56.260> like<00:03:56.290> organic

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
schooled on this and I feel like organic

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.190 
schooled on this and I feel like organic
and<00:03:57.190> both<00:03:57.640> both<00:03:57.970> organic<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.540> local<00:03:59.020> are

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and both both organic and local are

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.790 
and both both organic and local are
really<00:03:59.590> important<00:04:00.070> why<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.660> think<00:04:01.800> I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
really important why because I think I

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.150 
really important why because I think I
think<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.670> there<00:04:03.820> are<00:04:03.850> natural<00:04:04.150> ways<00:04:04.570> to

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
think that there are natural ways to

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.980 
think that there are natural ways to
cultivate<00:04:06.160> food<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.270> price<00:04:07.480> needs<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.870> go

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
cultivate food but the price needs to go

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.540 
cultivate food but the price needs to go
down<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.200> little<00:04:08.320> bit<00:04:08.530> on<00:04:08.680> organic<00:04:09.100> food<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:09.489> a

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
down a little bit on organic food it's a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.420 
down a little bit on organic food it's a
little<00:04:09.760> pricey<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.800> as<00:04:11.800> far<00:04:12.070> as<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.280> you're
