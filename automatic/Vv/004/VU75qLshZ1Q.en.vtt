00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.230
 today I bring you this new video where 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.110
 let's see the top 40 of the best 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.969
 tweets for iphone / ipod touch and ipad the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.410
 second part if you have seen it in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 the first part I leave here in the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.710
 screen and also down here in the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 description and good without saying more 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.239
 let's start the first touch we're going to 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.439
 see today will allow us 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.540
 modify the brightness of our 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.309
 device without the need to enter 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.800
 to the control center or to the application 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.210
 native settings for it only 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.980
 we have to put pressure on what is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 our home button or the button 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.679
 start and then press the key 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.480
 more or to lower the volume these two 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.640
 these two buttons we have to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.499
 press them we would press 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 here and we will raise the brightness as you 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.550
 can see or we would diminish it from a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.109
 pretty simple way the next 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.329
 what we see on the screen is called 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.100
 smart up will allow us to block and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.839
 unlock our device without the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 need to use the button 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.489
 lock or sleep button us 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.620
 we just have to give two caps to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.409
 the screen either to block it or 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.390
 to unlock it this tweet allows us 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.550
 have what are the notifications of the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.750
 app the watch in what is our 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.030
 device 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
 iphone / ipod touch or ipad like you 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.410
 can see they look pretty good there 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 we have the image of the application 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.890
 example in this case that is a message 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330
 there my email appears to me 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 the message I'm receiving appears 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 and how long did they send it to me? 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 notification as you can see is very very 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 simple but very beautiful what is this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 tweet gives a new look to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 our device so download the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.680
 next tweet they will love to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.190
 all those who do not have the possibility 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.590
 of hiring 'spotify premium' this 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.030
 allows to have this 'spotify premium' or 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 at least remove what is the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 advertising and reproduction in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.350
 Random is very very useful aesthetic to me 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 I love it but for that I suggest 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.890
 to see the video that I leave with the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.170
 description so they can use it and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 understand it one hundred percent the twitter 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.690
 com screen settings I do pretty 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.729
 useful will allow us to add certain 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.100
 sections of what is the application of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 adjustments to our home screen by 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.310
 example here I am 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.100
 in the sounds section I could 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.590
 put here in add icon to what is 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.360
 the home screen and once you 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.710
 They tap on this side for me will 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.020
 start to look like 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.360
 are these sections so that I can 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.300
 access them easily in this case 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.040
 for example I have screen and brightness and if 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.380
 I give him tap as you can see me 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.960
 appears as a folder and I 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.700
 the screen section and brightness appear 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.320
 in which I will be able to modify what 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.020
 which is the brightness also the size of the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.210
 text and so forth is very useful this tweet and 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.400
 I suggest you download it now 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.920
 we are seeing slip effects one of the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.480
 older tweets from cydia but that 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.630
 even so it remains our 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.610
 favorites this allows us to modify the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 animation when blocking our 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.510
 device as you can see here 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.490
 I have selected what an effect is 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 at the moment that is or what is going to 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.770
 appear this effect that in this case is 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.570
 a tv effect if I block what is 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.730
 my device just like you are 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.280
 to see at this moment is going to see the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.350
 effect like a television was turned off 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.930
 which looks pretty nice and a lot 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.940
 people like there are many effects more than 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.310
 done we can put it random so that 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.740
 different effects appear each time 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 that we block is a subject and the last 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.020
 touch let's see today is the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.680
 I love it better 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.930
 helps us to prevent the theft of 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.670
 our device or rather to 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.970
 know who has our device 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.580
 once we lose it or they do not steal them and 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.310
 others since this tweet at the moment in the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.340
 that you put incorrectly what 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.400
 is the password a photograph is taken 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.380
 with the with the front camera of the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.450
 person who logically messed up your 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.960
 password send your mail 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.410
 electronic and apart it gives you an alert 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.020
 they misplaced your password and it gives you 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.670
 that alert and it tells you logically 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.370
 a message appears that the phone has 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.770
 been stolen and that's why I like it quite 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.770
 and well, here ends the second 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.360
 part of this top of tweets you know that 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.370
 if you liked this video you can give me 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.620
 like to put it in favorites comment 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.690
 subscribe but first I want to tell you 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.180
 how is it that you can download some of 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.560
 the tweets you saw on this list to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.330
 this you have to go so diaz 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.370
 logically you have to have jailbreak 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.890
 after you go to sources you go to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.480
 give in edit add and you are going to add the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.470
 repository that is appearing in 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.000
 screen 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.500
 once you add this repository 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 I will also leave it to you with the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.850
 description in case it does not appear here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.710
 once you add what will happen 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.200
 is that you have to go and look for and 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.150
 are you going to judge any tweet you saw 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.590
 in this list the name of the tweets 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.350
 logically you appeared in the part 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.660
 bottom of the screen you are looking for it 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.120
 downloads from the network because I showed them you 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.770
 in installing and confirming and this 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 way I will have any tweet 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.520
 that you have seen here and well then now 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.930
 yes see you until the next and not 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.930
