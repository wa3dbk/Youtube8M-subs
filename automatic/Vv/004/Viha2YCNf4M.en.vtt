well it's 7 degrees out it's still cold

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.240 
well it's 7 degrees out it's still cold
and<00:00:06.330> snowy<00:00:06.540> but<00:00:06.870> that's<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.350> 42<00:00:07.980> degrees

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250

and snowy but that's a 42 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:09.620> and<00:00:10.620> I've<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.040> spent<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.460> long

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
Fahrenheit and I've just spent a long

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.599 
Fahrenheit and I've just spent a long
time<00:00:12.500> testing<00:00:13.500> everything<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.130> my<00:00:14.250> truck<00:00:16.609> this

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
time testing everything on my truck this

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.370 
time testing everything on my truck this
is<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:17.970> diesel<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> Glo<00:00:18.960> controller

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
is my diesel with the Glo controller

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.550 
is my diesel with the Glo controller
back<00:00:19.680> there<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.660> just<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.810> done<00:00:22.050> taking<00:00:22.439> out

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
back there I just got done taking out

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.429 
back there I just got done taking out
the<00:00:22.680> relay<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.160> making<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> work<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.439> tested

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the relay and making it work I tested

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
the relay and making it work I tested
every<00:00:25.769> wire<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.310> continuity<00:00:26.789> feeding<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
every wire for continuity feeding the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.160 
every wire for continuity feeding the
system<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.730> did<00:00:29.730> find<00:00:30.029> bad<00:00:30.449> connections<00:00:30.990> on

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
system I did find bad connections on

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
system I did find bad connections on
this<00:00:31.320> connector<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.890> fed<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.340> B+<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
this connector that fed the B+ to the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260 
this connector that fed the B+ to the
glow<00:00:33.840> plugs<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:35.250> cut<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> connector

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
glow plugs and I cut out the connector

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.500 
glow plugs and I cut out the connector
and<00:00:36.450> put<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.170> rat's<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:40.040> took<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.520> wire<00:00:42.180> off

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and put my rat's in I took the wire off

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
and put my rat's in I took the wire off
every<00:00:42.870> single<00:00:43.050> glow<00:00:43.379> plug<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> tested<00:00:44.190> them

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
every single glow plug and tested them

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.000 
every single glow plug and tested them
and<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.670> read<00:00:44.910> between<00:00:45.120> point<00:00:45.750> 1<00:00:45.960> ohm

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
and they all read between point 1 ohm

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
and they all read between point 1 ohm
2.4<00:00:47.010> ohms<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.850> they're<00:00:48.090> good<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:49.160> did<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> voltage

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
2.4 ohms so they're good I did a voltage

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.689 
2.4 ohms so they're good I did a voltage
I<00:00:50.910> mean<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.719> did<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> continuity<00:00:52.800> test<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.370> every

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
I mean I did a continuity test on every

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
I mean I did a continuity test on every
wire<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> controller<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.440> that's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
wire back to the controller so that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.049 
wire back to the controller so that's
good<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.899> did<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.219> check<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.730> get

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
good and then I just did a check to get

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.590 
good and then I just did a check to get
the<00:01:00.270> controller<00:01:01.109> turned<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.329> check<00:01:03.329> power

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the controller turned on and check power

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
the controller turned on and check power
and<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.229> power<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> each<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and there's power to each one of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.710 
and there's power to each one of the
glow<00:01:06.119> plugs<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.760> do<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.970> Wiggly<00:01:09.420> metal

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
glow plugs and do that Wiggly metal

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
glow plugs and do that Wiggly metal
resistor<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.189> voltage<00:01:11.250> dropped<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.210> five

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
resistor the voltage dropped to five

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
resistor the voltage dropped to five
point<00:01:12.810> seven<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.320> six<00:01:13.530> point<00:01:13.770> three<00:01:13.860> volts<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
point seven to six point three volts to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.570 
point seven to six point three volts to
each<00:01:15.150> goal<00:01:15.479> plug<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.380> satisfactory

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
each goal plug so that's satisfactory

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
each goal plug so that's satisfactory
I<00:01:20.270> brought<00:01:21.270> ether<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> try

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I brought ether but I'm not going to try

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
I brought ether but I'm not going to try
it<00:01:22.619> first<00:01:23.009> time<00:01:24.799> got<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.040> best<00:01:26.430> batteries

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it first time got my two best batteries

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.289 
it first time got my two best batteries
again<00:01:27.060> including<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.750> diehard

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.599 

so<00:01:32.990> let's<00:01:33.229> see<00:01:33.409> if<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.710> killer<00:01:34.009> isn't<00:01:34.429> dead

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
so let's see if this killer isn't dead

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.580 
so let's see if this killer isn't dead
yet<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:35.149> has<00:01:35.329> never<00:01:35.630> started<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.320> seven

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
yet it has never started in the seven

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.370 
yet it has never started in the seven
years<00:01:36.799> I've<00:01:37.009> owned<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.490> by<00:01:38.450> itself<00:01:38.840> unless<00:01:39.170> you

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
years I've owned it by itself unless you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.050 
years I've owned it by itself unless you
towed<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.740> when<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:39.979> was<00:01:40.070> cold<00:01:40.280> it's<00:01:40.789> never

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
towed it when it was cold it's never

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.510 
towed it when it was cold it's never
