right foot and a couple of shots as well

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.940 
right foot and a couple of shots as well
so<00:01:26.939> his<00:01:27.060> his<00:01:27.420> weak<00:01:27.659> foot<00:01:27.900> isn't<00:01:28.080> too<00:01:28.439> bad<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so his his weak foot isn't too bad and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
so his his weak foot isn't too bad and
even<00:01:29.460> though<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.640> has<00:01:29.790> full<00:01:29.939> star<00:01:30.210> weak<00:01:30.360> foot

even though he has full star weak foot

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.020 
even though he has full star weak foot
it<00:01:30.810> seems<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.100> lives<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> 4

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it seems as if it lives up to that 4

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
good he did give me a couple of headers

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.119

and<00:02:05.790> his<00:02:06.240> height<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.689> decent<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.259> well<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.950> for

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and his height is decent as well but for

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580 
and his height is decent as well but for
his<00:02:08.280> height<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.610> his<00:02:08.940> pace<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.379> good

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
his height and his pace is really good

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.979 
his height and his pace is really good
but<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> second<00:02:11.940> half<00:02:11.970> he<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:12.690> tends

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
but in the second half he that he tends

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
but in the second half he that he tends
to<00:02:13.200> get

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to get

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
to get
it<00:02:13.590> tired<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.400> hated<00:02:14.670> about<00:02:14.910> him<00:02:15.120> he

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it tired which I hated about him he

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840 
it tired which I hated about him he
seems<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.140> slow<00:02:16.440> down<00:02:16.680> his<00:02:16.950> pace<00:02:17.190> goes<00:02:17.490> down<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
seems to slow down his pace goes down to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.890 
seems to slow down his pace goes down to
like<00:02:17.970> 80<00:02:18.270> pace

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
like 80 pace

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.080 
like 80 pace
maybe<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.500> because<00:02:19.800> his<00:02:19.980> agility<00:02:20.430> isn't<00:02:20.970> too

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
maybe it's because his agility isn't too

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.570 
maybe it's because his agility isn't too
high<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.960> know<00:02:22.050> what<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.830> damn<00:02:23.280> it

centre-forward or a strike or you could

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
centre-forward or a strike or you could
always<00:02:59.400> move<00:02:59.640> him<00:02:59.820> down<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.239> center

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
always move him down to that center

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.510 
always move him down to that center
midfield<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.020> center<00:03:01.470> defensive<00:03:02.040> midfielder

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
midfield or center defensive midfielder

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.650 
midfield or center defensive midfielder
even<00:03:02.790> though<00:03:02.880> his<00:03:03.000> work<00:03:03.180> rates<00:03:03.390> aren't<00:03:03.540> too

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
even though his work rates aren't too

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.420 
even though his work rates aren't too
great<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.739> could<00:03:04.860> also<00:03:05.070> try

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
great for that but you could also try

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.370 
great for that but you could also try
them<00:03:05.550> out<00:03:05.640> as<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> center<00:03:06.209> attacker<00:03:06.420> Matua<00:03:06.750> so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
them out as a center attacker Matua so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.380 
them out as a center attacker Matua so
it<00:03:07.530> gives<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.890> more<00:03:07.920> options<00:03:08.190> more<00:03:08.700> freedom

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
it gives you more options more freedom

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.460 
it gives you more options more freedom
to<00:03:09.420> where<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.780> want<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.050> put<00:03:10.140> him<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.350> your

to where you want to put him in your

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.260 
to where you want to put him in your
squad<00:03:10.739> rather<00:03:10.980> than<00:03:11.160> left<00:03:11.640> doing<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.090> left

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
squad rather than left doing a left

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.090 
squad rather than left doing a left
forward<00:03:12.660> or<00:03:12.780> left<00:03:12.959> Mutulu<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.770> guys<00:03:13.920> don't

forward or left Mutulu if you guys don't
know<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.310> mean<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.360> pretty<00:03:15.540> much

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
know what I mean so that is pretty much

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.810 
know what I mean so that is pretty much
it<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.650> only<00:03:16.890> things<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.280> did<00:03:17.489> not<00:03:17.519> like

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it so the only things I did not like

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.910 
it so the only things I did not like
biome<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.330> ease<00:03:18.420> out<00:03:18.630> position<00:03:19.170> frequently<00:03:19.410> if

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
biome is ease out position frequently if

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.039 
biome is ease out position frequently if
you<00:03:20.310> try<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.580> mouse<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> strike<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:21.450> centre

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
you try a mouse a strike or centre

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.600 
you try a mouse a strike or centre
forward<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.620> much<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.430> want<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
forward not as much so if you want to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.370 
forward not as much so if you want to
try<00:03:23.790> mine<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> centre<00:03:24.390> forward<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:25.049> ain't

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
try mine as a centre forward this ain't

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
second half I'm not too sure why and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.000 
second half I'm not too sure why and
very<00:03:33.030> expensive<00:03:33.540> 1<00:03:34.019> million<00:03:34.320> coins<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.830> now
