let's do it quickly to be on this got my
dog<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.670> don't<00:01:25.819> know<00:01:25.940> thinking<00:01:26.539> either<00:01:26.660> it's<00:01:26.899> my

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
dog I don't know thinking either it's my

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.880 
dog I don't know thinking either it's my
dog<00:01:27.289> -<00:01:27.500> Bailey<00:01:27.860> Bailey<00:01:29.530> chilling<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.619> me<00:01:30.710> for

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
dog - Bailey Bailey chilling with me for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.919 
dog - Bailey Bailey chilling with me for
once

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
once

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:40.720 
once
anyways

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.390 

how<00:01:41.270> much<00:01:41.420> fat<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.900> 15<00:01:42.590> grams<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.950> fat<00:01:45.340> anyways

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.680 

so<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.760> pretty<00:01:49.940> much<00:01:50.030> do<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.390> eat<00:01:50.570> them

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so this is pretty much do you eat them

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.100 
so this is pretty much do you eat them
all<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:51.650> doesn't<00:01:51.950> go<00:01:52.010> back<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.540> well<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:53.750> guess

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
all that doesn't go back on well I guess

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740 
all that doesn't go back on well I guess
it<00:01:54.260> does<00:01:54.640> nevermind<00:01:55.640> he<00:01:55.970> doesn't<00:01:56.240> run<00:01:56.950> sort<00:01:57.950> of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
it does nevermind he doesn't run sort of

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:10.930 
it does nevermind he doesn't run sort of
so<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.870> looks<00:02:00.020> like<00:02:01.750> little<00:02:02.750> shoe<00:02:02.900> strings
