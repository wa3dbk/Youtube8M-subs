incredibly punchy and resonant the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.070 
incredibly punchy and resonant the
things<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.150> look<00:04:27.330> for<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.630> guitar<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> mean

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
things I look for in a guitar I mean

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.510 
things I look for in a guitar I mean
like<00:04:28.260> one<00:04:28.770> thing<00:04:28.890> they've<00:04:29.040> been<00:04:29.070> starting<00:04:29.490> to

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
like one thing they've been starting to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.650 
like one thing they've been starting to
do<00:04:29.670> is<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:29.850> make<00:04:30.030> their<00:04:30.180> guitars<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.510> little

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
do is like make their guitars a little

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.330 
do is like make their guitars a little
bit<00:04:30.750> lighter<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.290> really<00:04:31.770> think<00:04:32.010> that<00:04:32.070> like<00:04:32.310> a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
bit lighter I really think that like a

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.030 
bit lighter I really think that like a
stiff<00:04:32.760> neck<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.300> lightweight<00:04:33.510> body<00:04:34.040> yield

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
stiff neck and a lightweight body yield

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.200 
stiff neck and a lightweight body yield
the<00:04:35.160> sound<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.940> get<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
the sound that I like you get the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.670 
the sound that I like you get the
mid-range<00:04:36.630> crunch<00:04:37.020> out<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.650> really

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
mid-range crunch out of it it's really

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.430 
mid-range crunch out of it it's really
Spanky<00:04:38.280> exactly<00:04:41.180> big<00:04:42.180> hard<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.200> I

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440
