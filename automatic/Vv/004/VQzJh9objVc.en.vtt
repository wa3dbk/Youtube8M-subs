00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and before his shooting was a bit a bit

with this guy that's the only way you're

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.570 
with this guy that's the only way you're
gonna<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.500> able<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.069> into<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> penalty

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
area or create space with him Oh

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
area or create space with him Oh
so<00:02:13.620> his<00:02:13.770> strength<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.280> aggression<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.930> bit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so his strength and aggression is a bit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020 
so his strength and aggression is a bit
in<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> middle<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.160> mean<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.370> don't<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:17.820> what

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
in the middle I mean I don't know what

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
in the middle I mean I don't know what
to<00:02:18.120> say<00:02:18.270> about<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.630> sometimes<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.410> will

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to say about this sometimes you will

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.440 
to say about this sometimes you will
find<00:02:19.770> them<00:02:19.920> strong<00:02:20.250> against<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.970> defenders

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
find them strong against some defenders

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910 
find them strong against some defenders
and<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.780> some<00:02:21.990> situation<00:02:22.530> you'll<00:02:22.650> find

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and in some situation you'll find

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.070 
and in some situation you'll find
they're<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.280> damn<00:02:23.610> weak<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.390> unbelievable

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
they're so damn weak it's unbelievable

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720 
they're so damn weak it's unbelievable
but<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.350> again<00:02:25.470> his<00:02:25.740> balance<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.130> quite

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but then again his balance is quite

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.000 
but then again his balance is quite
so<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.360> really<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.470> you're

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
so it's really up to you if you're

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
so it's really up to you if you're
looking<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.730> sword<00:02:30.000> player<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.390> Mario

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
looking for this sword player but Mario

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.660 
looking for this sword player but Mario
Gomez<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.290> definitely<00:02:31.980> stronger<00:02:32.400> than<00:02:32.520> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
Gomez is definitely stronger than this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.310 
Gomez is definitely stronger than this
guy<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.209> tried<00:02:33.450> Mario<00:02:33.780> Gomez<00:02:34.110> you'll

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
guy so if you tried Mario Gomez you'll

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.740 
guy so if you tried Mario Gomez you'll
know<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.220> guy<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.510> him

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
know that this guy is not as good as him

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.199 
know that this guy is not as good as him
so<00:02:37.110> dribbling<00:02:37.920> still<00:02:38.190> sucks<00:02:38.520> his<00:02:38.730> balance<00:02:39.120> I

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
so dribbling still sucks his balance I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.150 
so dribbling still sucks his balance I
think<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.570> what<00:02:39.870> makes<00:02:39.900> him<00:02:40.350> seem<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.860> weak

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
think is what makes him seem so weak

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.890 
think is what makes him seem so weak
every<00:02:41.580> time<00:02:41.760> someone<00:02:42.030> touches<00:02:42.300> him<00:02:42.570> he's<00:02:42.720> on

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
every time someone touches him he's on

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.660 
every time someone touches him he's on
the<00:02:43.080> floor<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.860> his<00:02:43.980> balance<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.370> really

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the floor so his balance is really

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
the floor so his balance is really
really<00:02:44.940> bad<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.480> though<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.720> upgrade<00:02:46.110> is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
really bad even though the upgrade is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.680 
really bad even though the upgrade is
still<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.680> still<00:02:46.920> think<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.489> pretty<00:02:47.850> bad<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.570> I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
still I still think is pretty bad like I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.900 
still I still think is pretty bad like I
said<00:02:48.750> weak<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:49.650> situations<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
is very annoying over the net

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.870 
is very annoying over the net
he's<00:02:55.050> an<00:02:55.200> okay<00:02:55.650> decent<00:02:56.100> player<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:56.520> why<00:02:56.670> would

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
he's an okay decent player but why would

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.420 
he's an okay decent player but why would
