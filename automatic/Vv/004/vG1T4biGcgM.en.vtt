hang-ups and infinity war did a really
poor<00:02:56.180> job<00:02:56.510> at<00:02:58.510> addressing<00:02:59.510> those<00:02:59.840> issues<00:02:59.900> but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
poor job at addressing those issues but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.559

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
first modern warfare was just a

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.680 
first modern warfare was just a
phenomenal<00:03:27.230> game<00:03:28.010> well<00:03:28.489> according<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.510> most

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
phenomenal game well according to most

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.539 
phenomenal game well according to most
of<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.930> guys<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.319> really<00:03:30.680> didn't<00:03:30.949> get<00:03:31.069> into<00:03:31.400> it

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
of you guys I really didn't get into it

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.110 
of you guys I really didn't get into it
but<00:03:32.409> it's<00:03:33.409> safe<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.889> say<00:03:33.919> that<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.730> college

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
but it's safe to say that the college

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.960 
but it's safe to say that the college
ooty<00:03:35.299> community<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:37.430> probably<00:03:37.639> one<00:03:37.940> of

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
ooty community it's probably one of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.089 
ooty community it's probably one of
their<00:03:38.120> favorite<00:03:38.479> call<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.780> duty's<00:03:39.019> ever<00:03:39.229> this

their favorite call of duty's ever this
call<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.459> duty<00:03:40.669> 4<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.310> when<00:03:43.310> modern

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
call of duty 4 and so when modern

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.699 
call of duty 4 and so when modern
warfare<00:03:43.790> 2<00:03:44.209> came<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:48.260> enjoyed<00:03:48.680> it

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
warfare 2 came out I really enjoyed it

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.229

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
like I picked it up everyone was playing

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.149

it and I really enjoy I really enjoyed

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.680 
it and I really enjoy I really enjoyed
mountain<00:03:52.639> where<00:03:52.729> 42<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.180> probably<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.510> first

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
mountain where 42 is probably the first

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
mountain where 42 is probably the first
game<00:03:54.019> since<00:03:54.260> gears<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.620> war<00:03:54.709> one<00:03:54.889> came<00:03:55.099> out

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
game since gears of war one came out

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.740 
game since gears of war one came out
that<00:03:55.430> actually<00:03:55.729> pulled<00:03:55.970> me<00:03:56.060> away<00:03:56.239> from<00:03:56.389> gears

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
that actually pulled me away from gears

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.250 
that actually pulled me away from gears
of<00:03:56.900> war<00:03:56.989> one<00:03:57.169> and<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:58.690> guess<00:03:59.690> it's<00:03:59.870> kind<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.109> like

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
of war one and I guess it's kind of like

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.539 
of war one and I guess it's kind of like
the<00:04:00.440> same<00:04:00.709> thing<00:04:01.010> as<00:04:01.359> gears<00:04:02.359> you<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:04.280> relate

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
the same thing as gears you can relate

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.360 
the same thing as gears you can relate
it<00:04:04.699> to<00:04:04.729> call<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.180> duty<00:04:05.419> and<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.889> gears<00:04:07.129> of<00:04:07.250> war

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
it to call of duty and the gears of war

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.399 
it to call of duty and the gears of war
one<00:04:07.639> in<00:04:07.790> gears<00:04:07.940> war<00:04:08.120> two<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.329> then<00:04:08.780> called<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
one in gears war two and then called you

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.099 
one in gears war two and then called you
the<00:04:09.560> modern<00:04:09.949> warfare<00:04:10.099> modern<00:04:10.699> warfare<00:04:10.909> 2<00:04:11.299> like

the modern warfare modern warfare 2 like
