00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
come all the way back here so they still

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.690 
come all the way back here so they still
expose<00:02:49.140> most<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.830> top<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.160> my<00:02:50.280> foot<00:02:50.520> which

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
but I thought he's in DSW and I thought

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.850 
but I thought he's in DSW and I thought
well<00:03:27.420> I'll<00:03:27.600> try<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:27.959> on<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.320> what<00:03:28.830> I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
think I might get them on my feet and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.840 
think I might get them on my feet and
hate<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> gold<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.860> second<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.670> got

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
hate the gold but the second that I got

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.610

they<00:03:34.890> look<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.280> much<00:03:35.400> better<00:03:35.610> than<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.330> thought

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
they look so much better than I thought

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.090 
they look so much better than I thought
that<00:03:36.780> they<00:03:36.900> would<00:03:37.110> they're<00:03:37.470> super

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that they would they're super

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.350 
that they would they're super
comfortable<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.880> really<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.330> about

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
comfortable but I really like about

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
comfortable but I really like about
these<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.989> gold<00:03:40.170> part<00:03:40.440> fits<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.920> my<00:03:40.950> foot

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
these is the gold part fits to my foot

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.460 
these is the gold part fits to my foot
really<00:03:41.550> nicely<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:42.090> it's<00:03:42.330> bendy<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.320> it

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
really nicely because it's bendy so it

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.290 
really nicely because it's bendy so it
can<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:44.100> mold<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.520> my<00:03:44.610> foot<00:03:44.880> instead<00:03:45.180> of

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
can actually mold to my foot instead of

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.270 
can actually mold to my foot instead of
looking<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.900> little<00:03:46.140> bit<00:03:46.290> awkward<00:03:46.500> there<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
looking a little bit awkward there and I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.620 
looking a little bit awkward there and I
was<00:03:47.400> surprised<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.880> these<00:03:48.060> were<00:03:48.209> actually

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
was surprised that these were actually

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.180 
was surprised that these were actually
quite<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.959> bit<00:03:49.200> more<00:03:49.350> comfortable<00:03:49.590> than<00:03:50.100> they

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
quite a bit more comfortable than they

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.340 
quite a bit more comfortable than they
look<00:03:50.400> because<00:03:50.700> typically<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:51.959> at<00:03:52.050> Steve

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
look because typically I look at Steve

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.500 
look because typically I look at Steve
Madden<00:03:52.770> sandals<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> footbed<00:03:54.239> and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
Madden sandals and I see the footbed and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.720 
Madden sandals and I see the footbed and
it's<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:55.230> padded<00:03:55.830> at<00:03:56.010> all<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.640> like

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
it's like not padded at all it's like

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.550 
it's like not padded at all it's like
hard<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> rock

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
hard as a rock

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.660 
hard as a rock
so<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> was<00:03:58.800> afraid<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.100> these<00:03:59.340> might<00:03:59.520> be<00:03:59.640> a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so I was afraid that these might be a

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.190 
so I was afraid that these might be a
little<00:03:59.760> bit<00:04:00.180> uncomfortable<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:01.020> but

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
little bit uncomfortable there but

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.660 
little bit uncomfortable there but
they're<00:04:01.350> not<00:04:01.380> at<00:04:01.770> all<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.100> next<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.459> have<00:04:02.640> a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
wedges and I don't wear a lot of heels

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.160 
wedges and I don't wear a lot of heels
in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.030> summer<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.630> don't<00:04:09.810> wear<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> lot<00:04:10.050> of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
in the summer I don't wear a lot of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.960 
in the summer I don't wear a lot of
heels<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.650> general<00:04:11.070> let's<00:04:11.280> be<00:04:11.430> honest<00:04:11.730> here

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
heels in general let's be honest here

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.870 
heels in general let's be honest here
but<00:04:12.360> when<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.540> do<00:04:12.660> wear<00:04:13.380> heels<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.700> much

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
but when I do wear heels it's so much

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.699 
but when I do wear heels it's so much
easier<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.269> walk<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.750> wedge<00:04:15.930> than<00:04:16.260> an<00:04:16.380> actual

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
easier to walk in a wedge than an actual

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.069 
easier to walk in a wedge than an actual
stiletto<00:04:17.220> heel<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.760> prefer<00:04:17.970> wedges<00:04:18.600> they're

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
stiletto heel so I prefer wedges they're

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.849 
stiletto heel so I prefer wedges they're
super<00:04:19.560> cute

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
have kind of like a leather detailing

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.580 
have kind of like a leather detailing
strap<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.460> like<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.849> color<00:05:15.060> because<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:16.409> get

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.050 
and I could see everywhere that I had
walked<00:05:37.259> because<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:37.830> imprinted<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.580> Roxie

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
walked because it imprinted the Roxie

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.969 
walked because it imprinted the Roxie
logo<00:05:39.599> everywhere<00:05:40.199> that<00:05:40.349> I<00:05:40.409> went<00:05:40.440> so<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:40.830> could

logo everywhere that I went so you could

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.249 
logo everywhere that I went so you could
see<00:05:41.099> like<00:05:41.250> normal<00:05:41.729> flip-flops<00:05:42.210> all<00:05:42.719> around
