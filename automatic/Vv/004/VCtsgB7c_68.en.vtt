00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.259
 small houses and you do what people can buy in Cancun for a long time 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.100
 money is that the construction companies have become important potentates of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.210
 money at the expense of those who buy houses and under the protection of the authorities the 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.640
 holder of the institute of the housing of the state enrique alcocer recognized that it is 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.179
 a real problem because the land according to the law of 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.489
 subdivisions must be 7 meters with 20 centimeters in front by 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.970
 a length of 16 meters when some houses measure less than five meters 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.780
 In front of Mr. Carlos Jiménez he bought his house for 240 thousand pesos, he paid in 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.660
 cash but those who bought credited paid in udis and simply the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.329
 House prices have soared more than doubled we do not understand that there is 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.400
 there is a law of subdivisions tc have to respect 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000
 where they will give the percent measures 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.310
 of life cc must have a part in a modest but dignified dignified house 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.220
 from 7 20 by 16 of funds 20 where appropriate 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.830
 and the truth is that we are very sorry 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.500
 we understand that you have to do business and it's worth 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 but you do not have to privilege the business and leave everything aside the dignity and 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.990
 comfort of the people observing that the houses have all the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.500
 requirements of law is on the part of the municipality but it is not like that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.050
 the houses have 10 to 12 years are more than 30 megawatts that have been built but 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.340
 violating the law the house they had in 26 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.509
 belloch meters 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.540
 it was the first houses that had 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.280
 according to them it was the exact measurement that should have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.680
 17 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 onwards but not 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 not least because they are not suitable for housing 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.820
 that's why many cases like this one began to be built about ten 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.880
 years approximately 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.979
 0-3 but we bought four years ago 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 more than 50 votes of the delegates 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.640
 you can observe the room that barely 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.380
 It fits last Friday 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.690
 the applicant 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.810
 in the room 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170
 four meters approximately 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.720
 So are those little houses 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.220
 at that time for 240 thousand pesos 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 it was already a little money 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.839
 well things are two little houses 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.359
 as we can observe 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.369
 and well 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.719
 in this case the man bought it in cash but there are many people who 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.999
 he still keeps paying he has to pay up to 3 4 pesos what it cost 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.919
 families. 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.930
 since with the little space it creates psychological problems that are 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.819
 translated into intrafamily violence neighborhood problems and even 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.259
 delinquency with bands of young people who did not like to be simply in their 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.379
 house for more than 10 years they are also commercialized and houses 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.730
 which implies that construction companies have made millions 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.140
 to the complacency of the authorities with images of víctor álvarez juan 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.239
 Carlos Mendoza 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.010
