different like a Malaysian because we

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.969 
different like a Malaysian because we
Lex<00:04:41.270> audio<00:04:41.720> everything

healthy<00:04:47.569> there's<00:04:48.569> so<00:04:48.840> many<00:04:49.020> different

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
healthy there's so many different

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.929 
healthy there's so many different
flavors<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.099> textures<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.030> it's<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.199> about

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
flavors and textures and it's all about

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.429 
flavors and textures and it's all about
like<00:04:53.939> I<00:04:54.090> said<00:04:54.300> not<00:04:54.509> in<00:04:54.569> just<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.930> flavor<00:04:55.139> but

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
like I said not in just the flavor but

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.929 
like I said not in just the flavor but
texture<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:58.110> way<00:04:58.259> they're<00:04:58.529> combined<00:04:59.009> it

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
texture and the way they're combined it

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.989 
texture and the way they're combined it
I<00:05:00.710> think<00:05:01.710> it's<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.889> very<00:05:02.039> exciting<00:05:02.159> cuisine<00:05:02.819> I

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
I think it's a very exciting cuisine I

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.939 
I think it's a very exciting cuisine I
think<00:05:03.240> that's<00:05:03.419> what<00:05:03.569> makes<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.289> any<00:05:04.560> different

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
think that's what makes it any different

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.390 
think that's what makes it any different
is<00:05:05.009> the<00:05:05.249> fact<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.550> we<00:05:05.759> do<00:05:06.770> cater<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:08.009> various

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
is the fact that we do cater to various

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.480 
is the fact that we do cater to various
markets<00:05:08.819> I<00:05:11.990> think<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.439> future<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.889> Malaysian

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
markets I think the future of Malaysian

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.550 
markets I think the future of Malaysian
cuisine<00:05:14.639> is<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.900> really<00:05:16.229> bright<00:05:16.500> future

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
cuisine is a really bright future

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.050 
cuisine is a really bright future
because<00:05:18.259> people<00:05:19.259> are<00:05:19.500> getting<00:05:19.680> less<00:05:20.219> excited

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
because people are getting less excited

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.610 
because people are getting less excited
