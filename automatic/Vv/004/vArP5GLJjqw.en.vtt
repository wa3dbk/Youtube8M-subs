00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
one rain stopped we just move at seventy

percent<00:05:57.870> speed<00:05:58.439> instead<00:05:58.710> of<00:05:59.009> I<00:05:59.189> think<00:05:59.249> it<00:05:59.610> was

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
percent speed instead of I think it was

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:08.260 
percent speed instead of I think it was
thirty<00:06:00.090> percent<00:06:00.509> or<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:02.539> let<00:06:03.539> me<00:06:03.689> get<00:06:04.349> the<00:06:04.439> gold

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.790 

money<00:06:08.960> for<00:06:09.290> training

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.089 

Oh

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.330 

anyway

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
anyway

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.379 
anyway
we<00:06:20.910> go<00:06:21.060> get<00:06:21.270> training<00:06:21.780> down<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.440> will<00:06:23.430> possibly

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
we go get training down I will possibly

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.010 
we go get training down I will possibly
consider<00:06:25.080> making<00:06:25.440> a<00:06:25.860> robe<00:06:26.930> jets<00:06:27.930> furthest

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
consider making a robe jets furthest

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.930 
consider making a robe jets furthest
just<00:06:31.020> for<00:06:31.199> this<00:06:31.290> purpose<00:06:31.350> I<00:06:31.979> mean<00:06:32.190> we're

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
just for this purpose I mean we're

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.800 
just for this purpose I mean we're
moving<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.570> lot<00:06:33.780> faster<00:06:34.020> now<00:06:34.590> than<00:06:34.800> we

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
moving a lot faster now than we

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.219 
moving a lot faster now than we
or

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.290 

hunched<00:06:42.229> over<00:06:42.349> but<00:06:43.310> yes<00:06:43.520> we<00:06:43.729> move<00:06:43.939> a<00:06:44.060> lot

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
hunched over but yes we move a lot

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.550 
hunched over but yes we move a lot
faster<00:06:44.539> while<00:06:45.229> in<00:06:45.409> stealth<00:06:45.710> now<00:06:47.349> so<00:06:49.360> that's<00:06:50.360> it

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
faster while in stealth now so that's it

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.949 
faster while in stealth now so that's it
