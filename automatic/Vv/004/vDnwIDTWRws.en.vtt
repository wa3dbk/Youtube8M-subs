 hello to all friends, the former marvel.com 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.809
 berry drawn from an unboxing video it 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
 we'll play analyzing the watson 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 strike a button last keyboard from 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 mechanical gaming produced by 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 hooson starting from the package 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 we find an illustrative image of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.560
 produced a stamp that reminds us of le 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 keyboard typing app 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.359
 in this case an additional American 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 stamp that reminds us of the adoption of the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
 some rmx mechanical switches 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.510
 keyboard technical features 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 which we also find in the back of the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.160
 same package all around a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 further illustrative image 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.590
 also on the left side of the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.629
 packaging we find a kind of 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 table and reminds us which switches are 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.210
 employed in the narrow battle or 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.180
 available delli of the strike 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 with several mechanical switches in this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.680
 in case we received the strike 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.590
 battle conical rmx red then type 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.379
 linear that lend themselves more 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.240
 they were use in intensive gaming but 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.540
 icr blue mixes are also available 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 brown and the classic black preside 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 therefore to extract the keyboard and the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 relative fund we find therefore a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 watson sticker a user manual e 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.799
 the keyboard itself as we are at 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.560
 to see 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 the keyboard is in reduced size without 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.829
 on the numeric keypad 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.619
 so the Latin is high in a carriage 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.400
 in the keyboard it is covered with a tweet 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.530
 in satin-finish aluminum for coloring 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.110
 red which comes off very well with 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.020
 black working of the keys that are 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.979
 made in hubs and fonts are 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.500
 the laser CDs using strech battle 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.710
 not obviously having a cassino 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 numeric portal functionality on the keys 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.750
 f1 s11 which can be activated via the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 button with the symbol of the watson queen 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.320
 we should take this plus the button 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.860
 what interests us is the possibility 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.090
 to change the pooling and the king of the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.770
 keyboard via the plus function key 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.720
 f3 os4 or change the intensity of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.030
 red keyboard backlight 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.770
 always using the plus key 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.090
 click screen or collapse 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.379
 we also have the possibility of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.840
 run macros and remember them in 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.610
 five profiles for a total of 30 macros 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.310
 we always activate the function key 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.940
 with the watson logo and pressing i 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 keys placed above the darts in the back 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.470
 of the keyboard we find a lot of layout 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.860
 simple made of simple plastic 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.930
 there are the classic feet with a 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.120
 rubber coating that there 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.849
 will allow you to raise the keyboard e 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.099
 to facilitate typing or gaming 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.800
 the second of the people is the cable 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.290
 covered in fabric braid the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.440
 connector is not gold plated 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.560
 also as we had told you the dry one 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.519
 beats the receipt in the editorial office is equipped 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.430
 of cia remix red that now we are first 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.860
 as we see above his dogs c 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.590
 there is a LED that lights up 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.690
 red and as we have already said the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.459
 keyboard is equipped with an animation network 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.920
 complete with red color this is 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.870
 we refer you to everything
