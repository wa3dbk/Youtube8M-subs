and in a matter of a year can make a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.180 
and in a matter of a year can make a
huge<00:01:43.270> difference<00:01:43.600> between<00:01:43.800> one<00:01:44.800> form<00:01:45.040> of

but<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.970> depends<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.480> kind<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.660> lumpectomy

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
but it depends on the kind of lumpectomy

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.650 
but it depends on the kind of lumpectomy
and<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:56.800> you're<00:01:56.920> talking<00:01:57.310> about
