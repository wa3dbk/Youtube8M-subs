00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
run a bolt through the actual holder

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
run a bolt through the actual holder
holder<00:01:11.400> itself<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.590> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
holder itself actually a little bit of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.109 
holder itself actually a little bit of
effort<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.400> supposed<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> slide

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
effort actually supposed to slide

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.450 
effort actually supposed to slide
forward<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
forward and out so you see how that is

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
forward and out so you see how that is
mounted<00:01:20.900> there's<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.439> bolt

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
mounted there's actually a little bolt

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
mounted there's actually a little bolt
in<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.759> nut<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.180> fixed<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.570> there

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
in there and a nut that's fixed in there

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
in there and a nut that's fixed in there
as<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.430> does<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
as well so that's all that it does is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.020 
as well so that's all that it does is
just<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.720> allow<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> slide<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
just it allow it to slide right on in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
just it allow it to slide right on in
that's<00:01:33.630> why<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:33.930> call<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> four<00:01:34.560> lock<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that's why they call it four lock so you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.230 
that's why they call it four lock so you
just<00:01:36.180> line<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.759> then<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.850> course<00:01:39.060> once

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
just line it up and then of course once

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.950 
just line it up and then of course once
it's<00:01:39.420> lined<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.110> slide<00:01:40.939> over

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
it's lined up you just slide over

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.800 
it's lined up you just slide over
sometimes<00:01:42.960> give<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> tap

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
sometimes give it a little bit of a tap

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.990 
sometimes give it a little bit of a tap
locks<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.290> place

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
locks it right into place

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.980 
locks it right into place
also<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.479> ordered<00:01:49.579> a<00:01:50.579> bracket<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
also have ordered a bracket and of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
also have ordered a bracket and of
course<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.470> X<00:01:52.740> grip<00:01:53.040> from<00:01:53.399> Ram<00:01:53.820> mount<00:01:54.060> which

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
course the X grip from Ram mount which

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
course the X grip from Ram mount which
I'll<00:01:55.140> include<00:01:55.409> part<00:01:55.680> numbers<00:01:55.920> once<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
I'll include part numbers once I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
I'll include part numbers once I
installed<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.060> let's<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.719> how<00:01:57.780> successful

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
