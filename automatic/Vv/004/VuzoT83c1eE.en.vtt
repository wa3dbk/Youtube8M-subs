00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
strategy quite a bit I mean people are

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.750 
strategy quite a bit I mean people are
certainly<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> play<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.460> tight<00:00:47.610> as

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
