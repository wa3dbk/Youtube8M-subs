this<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.130> the<00:06:22.250> one<00:06:22.400> I<00:06:22.700> did<00:06:23.120> a<00:06:23.480> little<00:06:23.990> while<00:06:24.169> ago

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
this is the one I did a little while ago

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.470 
this is the one I did a little while ago
and<00:06:25.100> it's<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.370> whole<00:06:25.550> lot<00:06:25.760> smoother<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.300> that's

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
and it's a whole lot smoother and that's

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.070 
and it's a whole lot smoother and that's
just<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.990> flower<00:06:27.200> from<00:06:27.530> my<00:06:27.620> hands<00:06:28.610> right<00:06:28.790> now

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
just the flower from my hands right now

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.620 
just the flower from my hands right now
but<00:06:30.080> it's<00:06:30.200> a<00:06:30.320> whole<00:06:30.500> lot<00:06:30.680> smoother<00:06:31.160> and<00:06:31.630> it's

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
but it's a whole lot smoother and it's

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.240 
but it's a whole lot smoother and it's
nice<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.020> fun<00:06:33.169> to<00:06:33.320> play<00:06:33.530> with<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:33.950> you<00:06:34.040> can

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
nice and fun to play with and you can

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.830 
nice and fun to play with and you can
mold<00:06:34.820> a<00:06:34.910> bunch<00:06:35.060> of<00:06:35.120> stuff<00:06:35.360> with<00:06:35.510> it

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
mold a bunch of stuff with it

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.909 
mold a bunch of stuff with it
so<00:06:36.520> that's<00:06:37.520> how<00:06:37.850> you<00:06:38.200> make<00:06:39.200> something<00:06:39.740> like

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
so that's how you make something like

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.470 
so that's how you make something like
playdough<00:06:40.490> but<00:06:40.730> it's<00:06:40.850> still<00:06:40.940> really<00:06:41.210> fun<00:06:41.360> to

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
playdough but it's still really fun to

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.300 
playdough but it's still really fun to
