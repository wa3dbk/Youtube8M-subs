00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hi everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.559
 show you a no strategy strategy 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.420
 of farming then the strategy consists 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.529
 in the use of barbarian and goblin arches 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.619
 special strategy because it is for you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 just put them to steal resources but also 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 to get something we say in beard 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 then behind the proceedings for something 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:47.039
 very little if you want to see then 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.129
 stop caring community 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.350
 at the root it articulates into three come back 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.350
 teeth together don't want a banner 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.430
 that organic starts well has 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.250
 explained adding can be 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.250
 conferred 5 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:31.600
 absolute are already part of those 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:33.850
 collective punctures have been destroyed 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.950
 obviously try to complete the already 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.870
 made of external buildings usually 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.900
 principles of carlo vii viii on genius 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.280
 all the correctors the barracks and the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.130
 camps you should succeed in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.180
 get 50 percent 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.000
 this is the only rouge has reached the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 50 percent though how to tell if there is a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.780
 gold deposit the neighborhood to get it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.500
 for all I managed to do a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.120
 considerable number of resources 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.180
 obviously this strategy of limits 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 because you have to consider that you succeed in 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.950
 steal under what's inside 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:26.739
 gods inside the mines and the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.290
 extractors so you won't be able to 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.900
 completely steal everything but if yes 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.180
 find everything there better for you 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.739
 the advice to and to attack i 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.940
 level 7 enemies because you will succeed 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.640
 easily to do 50 percent with 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.140
 with external buildings for level 8 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.690
 there are more buildings then get the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.920
 50 percent won't be like that won't be 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.310
 simple but I can choose therefore vi 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.489
 I remember that the composition is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.290
 be formed by barbarian goblin archers 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.910
 but of himan and sorry giants and oh well 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.900
 some minor splits 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:13.410
 in case you need well guys 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.410
 for today everything is next
