thing with Pierce College obviously the
technology<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.219> changing<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
technology is always changing and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
technology is always changing and
there's<00:00:54.149> always<00:00:54.480> something<00:00:54.989> new<00:00:55.020> coming<00:00:55.379> out

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.819 
there's always something new coming out
I<00:00:55.860> mean<00:00:56.129> operating<00:00:57.120> systems<00:00:57.570> new<00:00:58.260> programs

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I mean operating systems new programs

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.939 
I mean operating systems new programs
new<00:00:59.660> office<00:01:00.660> suites<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.739> always

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
new office suites there's always

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
new office suites there's always
something<00:01:02.460> new<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> learn<00:01:03.390> but

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
something new that you have to learn but

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
something new that you have to learn but
that's<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> nice<00:01:05.250> part<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> too

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that's kind of a nice part of it too

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.359 
that's kind of a nice part of it too
because<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.900> always<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> same

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
because then it's not always the same

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:08.750 
because then it's not always the same
thing

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
thing

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
thing
you<00:01:09.030> don't<00:01:09.240> always<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.590> have

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you don't always come to work and have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940 
you don't always come to work and have
to<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> same<00:01:11.610> exact<00:01:12.030> task<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.860> know

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to do the same exact task or you know

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
to do the same exact task or you know
have<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> same<00:01:14.610> problem<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.570> every

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
have the same problem because every

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
have the same problem because every
computer<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.830> different<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
computer is different and there are so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
computer is different and there are so
many<00:01:19.170> different<00:01:19.590> things<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
many different things you can do in this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
many different things you can do in this
field<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.750> many<00:01:21.900> different<00:01:22.020> things

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
field and so many different things

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
field and so many different things
coming<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.939> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> expands<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
coming out that it kind of expands it a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.550 
coming out that it kind of expands it a
lot<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.009> interesting<00:01:26.850> being<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.570> female<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
lot it's interesting being a female and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
lot it's interesting being a female and
a<00:01:29.189> male<00:01:29.490> dominated<00:01:30.060> field<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> actually

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
a male dominated field but it's actually

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.080 
a male dominated field but it's actually
kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.509> fun<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.070> know<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.430> sounds<00:01:35.790> really

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

not the same problem even if it's the
same<00:02:18.780> exact<00:02:19.140> computer<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.040> could<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
same exact computer it could be a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640 
same exact computer it could be a
completely<00:02:21.150> different<00:02:21.300> problem<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:22.350> like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
completely different problem just like

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.640 
completely different problem just like
very<00:02:23.070> unique<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:24.500> frustrating<00:02:25.500> at

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
very unique and very frustrating at

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.370 
very unique and very frustrating at
times<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.430> very<00:02:26.940> fun<00:02:27.330> because<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.990> opens

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
times but very fun because it opens

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.070 
times but very fun because it opens
doors<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.340> learning<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.750> it's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
doors to learning more and it's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.660 
doors to learning more and it's
interesting<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.920> don't<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
interesting I don't really have a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.830 
interesting I don't really have a
typical<00:02:32.970> day<00:02:33.710> because<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.130> depends

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
typical day because it kind of depends

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.070 
typical day because it kind of depends
which<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.020> why<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.230> field<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:37.920> awesome

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
which is why this field is so awesome

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.150 
which is why this field is so awesome
but<00:02:40.080> generally<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.920> try<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.310> come<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
but generally I try to come in I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760 
but generally I try to come in I
maintain<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.370> lab<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.570> CNE<00:02:46.230> classrooms

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
maintain the lab for the CNE classrooms

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.770 
maintain the lab for the CNE classrooms
so<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.580> try<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.940> make<00:02:48.060> sure<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
so I try to make sure that all the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.280 
so I try to make sure that all the
computers<00:02:49.080> are<00:02:49.650> working<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.430> running<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.480> also

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
computers are working and running I also

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.030 
computers are working and running I also
maintain<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:54.290> Department<00:02:55.290> website<00:02:55.710> first

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
maintain the Department website first

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.440 
maintain the Department website first
being<00:02:56.400> me<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:58.040> by<00:02:59.040> doing<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.730> maintain<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
being me and by doing so I maintain a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.170 
being me and by doing so I maintain a
job<00:03:00.720> board<00:03:01.020> for<00:03:01.290> students<00:03:01.740> hoping<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.640> if

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
job board for students hoping that if

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.910

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
jobs but that could possibly help them I
