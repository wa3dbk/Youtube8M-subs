 the help of spatulas smeared with bulk 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:01.110
 Acrylic in the bath is also one of the main 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 parts this is ordinary baking soda when 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:10.739

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.799
 take maybe a dozen to 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.220
 when one glove could break through 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.250

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.180
 need it even without some of 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.950
