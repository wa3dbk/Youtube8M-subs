eight-hundred-dollar gaming pc build now
let's<00:00:04.620> get<00:00:04.770> straight<00:00:04.950> into<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.279> with<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
let's get straight into this with the

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.100 
let's get straight into this with the
cpu<00:00:06.120> i<00:00:06.180> went<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> AMD<00:00:07.160> fx-6300<00:00:08.870> six<00:00:09.870> core

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
cpu i went with the AMD fx-6300 six core

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
cpu i went with the AMD fx-6300 six core
processor<00:00:10.620> from<00:00:10.830> AMD<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.490> uses<00:00:11.759> am3+<00:00:12.500> it<00:00:13.500> runs

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
processor from AMD it uses am3+ it runs

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
out 3.9 gigahertz 95 well actually it's

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
out 3.9 gigahertz 95 well actually it's
125<00:00:17.460> watts<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.180> thinking<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.420> 95<00:00:18.869> wats

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
125 watts I was thinking about 95 wats

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.070 
125 watts I was thinking about 95 wats
from<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> regular<00:00:19.560> 6300<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.080> 6350

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
from the regular 6300 but the 6350

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500 
from the regular 6300 but the 6350
actually<00:00:22.560> runs<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.160> hotter<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.609> 125

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
actually runs a little bit hotter at 125

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.140 
actually runs a little bit hotter at 125
watt<00:00:24.810> obviously<00:00:25.619> six<00:00:25.890> cores<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.550> always<00:00:26.970> go

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
watt obviously six cores and I always go

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
watt obviously six cores and I always go
with<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.660> I've<00:00:27.810> said<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.109> my<00:00:28.260> multiple

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
with this like I've said in my multiple

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.400 
with this like I've said in my multiple
videos<00:00:29.369> before<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> 6300<00:00:30.900> over<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
videos before like the 6300 over the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
videos before like the 6300 over the
4300<00:00:31.949> because<00:00:32.550> you're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.570> getting

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
4300 because you're going to be getting

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.930 
4300 because you're going to be getting
you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.380> two<00:00:34.440> extra<00:00:34.920> cores<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.820> know

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you know two extra cores and you know

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
you know two extra cores and you know
that<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.390> doesn't<00:00:36.570> help<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.930> gaming<00:00:37.380> but

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that really doesn't help in gaming but

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.530 
that really doesn't help in gaming but
the<00:00:37.680> price<00:00:37.950> difference<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.670> minimal<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the price difference is so minimal that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
the price difference is so minimal that
you<00:00:39.719> might<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> anyway

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you might as well go with it anyway

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.350 
you might as well go with it anyway
because<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.430> does<00:00:41.610> keep<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> sense

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because it does keep you in a sense

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
because it does keep you in a sense
future-proof<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.250> help<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.550> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
future-proof and it will help you in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.279 
future-proof and it will help you in
things<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.879> video<00:00:45.090> editing<00:00:45.570> live<00:00:45.840> streaming

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
things like video editing live streaming

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
things like video editing live streaming
you<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.649> rendering<00:00:47.160> all<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> stuff<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you know rendering all that stuff that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020 
you know rendering all that stuff that
does<00:00:49.170> utilize<00:00:49.469> six-course<00:00:50.160> oh<00:00:50.340> yeah<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> guys

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
does utilize six-course oh yeah you guys

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
does utilize six-course oh yeah you guys
are<00:00:51.090> gonna<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> CP<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.620> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
are gonna like to CP a lot not gonna be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.369 
are gonna like to CP a lot not gonna be
too<00:00:52.980> too<00:00:53.190> great<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.460> gaming<00:00:53.850> uh<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
too too great for gaming uh you know in

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
too too great for gaming uh you know in
comparison<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> 4300<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:57.120> perform

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
comparison to the 4300 they perform

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
comparison to the 4300 they perform
about<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> same<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.680> gaming

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
about the same right now and gaming

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.229 
about the same right now and gaming
because<00:00:59.219> games<00:00:59.640> don't<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.059> take

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
because games don't really take

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.180 
because games don't really take
advantage<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> six<00:01:01.109> core<00:01:01.350> architecture

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
advantage of the six core architecture

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
advantage of the six core architecture
but<00:01:02.820> again<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.600> said<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> keep

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but again like I said it's going to keep

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
but again like I said it's going to keep
you<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> sense<00:01:04.890> future<00:01:05.339> /<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.939> games<00:01:06.210> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you in a sense future / if one games do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.200 
you in a sense future / if one games do
start<00:01:06.750> using<00:01:06.930> six<00:01:07.260> scores<00:01:08.180> for<00:01:09.180> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
now 16 gigs is so pointless it's not

now 16 gigs is so pointless it's not
even<00:02:32.519> funny<00:02:32.760> getting<00:02:33.689> 16<00:02:34.079> gigs<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.470> basically

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
even funny getting 16 gigs is basically

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.229 
even funny getting 16 gigs is basically
throwing<00:02:35.099> away<00:02:35.340> money<00:02:35.579> if<00:02:35.849> you're<00:02:36.060> just

trying to run games at 1080p so really

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.849

no<00:02:39.269> point<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.659> getting<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.019> 16<00:02:40.439> gigs<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.739> ram

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
no point in getting a 16 gigs of ram

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.170 
no point in getting a 16 gigs of ram
especially<00:02:41.340> because<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.700> price<00:02:41.909> difference

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
especially because the price difference

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.080 
especially because the price difference
is<00:02:42.510> ah<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.739> know<00:02:43.859> big<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.519> not<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
is ah you know big it's not like the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.449 
is ah you know big it's not like the
6300<00:02:45.810> compared<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> 4300<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.370> like

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
6300 compared to the 4300 but it's like

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.949 
6300 compared to the 4300 but it's like
a<00:02:47.489> ten<00:02:47.730> or<00:02:47.849> twenty<00:02:48.090> dollar<00:02:48.239> price<00:02:48.599> difference

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
a ten or twenty dollar price difference

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.410 
a ten or twenty dollar price difference
what<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> eight<00:02:49.799> gigs<00:02:50.129> from<00:02:50.489> 16<00:02:50.909> gigs<00:02:51.120> it's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
what the eight gigs from 16 gigs it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.729 
what the eight gigs from 16 gigs it's
like<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.599> fifty<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.049> sixty<00:02:52.379> dollar<00:02:52.500> price

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
like a fifty to sixty dollar price

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.199 
like a fifty to sixty dollar price
difference<00:02:53.159> so<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.700> eyes<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:53.909> much<00:02:54.060> better

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
difference so the eyes are much better

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.599 
difference so the eyes are much better
