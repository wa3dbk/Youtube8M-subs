00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.020
 heikki where youtube and good friends 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.830
 they will ask why I am in my 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.320
 start menu and well this what I'm 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.990
 doing here is that I'm going to teach them to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.929
 Make your own skin for the Maghreb 0.11 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.419
 zero point that some will want to make 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.939
 their own skins and do not know with what 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.769
 application or for example want a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.689
 custom skin to enter the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.899
 servers or just play in a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.359
 line with your friends like that and just do not 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.859
 they have or do not know how to do it and they walk 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.019
 unloading the others if they have 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 problems by the effect of are equal 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.429
 strong and in a way are going to go to the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.609
 place thor and they will look for skin tolkien 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:45.300
 is this application that is here 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's obviously free weighs around 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.309
 about 6 65 megabytes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 and 5 megabytes but around 167 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.310
 megabytes and well this the only thing that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.250
 let's do is open it 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.180
 and here once open this is going to give 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.670
 this menu 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.620
 here are quite a few other skins 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.330
 people can even grab their 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.220
 own body or your body from others 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 people towards their clothes and all that their 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.710
 design this the only thing that they do not grab 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.180
 they have to grab in their head because 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.840
 if it is not there if they are going to have a little 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.660
 of problem then you can buy the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.360
 testas here have to do buy me 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.860
 Well, he was hacked by a candle that 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.320
 but right now I think they will not let you 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.880
 this one can invite him and the sheet 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.090
 that with the look and for cher I do not know if 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.640
 it works you can still try it without 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.190
 without any risk because it is not going to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.500
 block the order ordered and good this one 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.920
 to create your corner they're just going to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.330
 enter this state you will be 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.910
 from arches 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.580
 and we are going to find here a 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.560
 corner let's take that away with the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 small square that has several squares 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.620
 in here installed button layer and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.830
 well here we have the skin basically 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.890
 Here this is for those who purchase the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.660
 other skins and all that and good this for 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 create the skin once we are going to press 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.420
 in front of the face in front of everything 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.060
 opposite and let's basically do a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.780
 so design a little fast, not for 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 example I'm going to do this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
 now let's make my face my own 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.520
 corner 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.160
 I do not know I do not remember well how 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.700
 let's do it like this let's start 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.640
 make him do so to see for example if 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.960
 so let's see I think that's how my ski goes 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.770
 I'm not quite sure is that I do not 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:47.030
 I remember well how it goes I was wrong 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.020
 it goes like this goes well to see again 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.020
 this way 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.209
 blue 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.260
 to do it and that blue dance for 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.689
 action 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.750
 It's something like that. I do not remember well. 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:06.290
 as I was going but but well, let's go 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.569
 grab the black and good and good I think 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.390
 that is something like that my style if my 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.879
 is something like that be there as you can see my 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.980
 face and talk good memory and 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.540
 can you go more or less the spoke 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.450
 with your chest you can do everything from 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.190
 black here nothing else they give him like that and they're going to 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.480
 go doing this forgive that's why 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.700
 come by plane 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.860
 and well nothing else paint everything like that 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.080
 they are doing so the hair is equal 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.120
 they are doing like this and it's good 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.560
 simple once done that they will give 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.319
 here they are going to give you know skin leonard 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.209
 hold folder and they will save it in the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.470
 folder where they remember I keep it 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.670
 in download there and there the route tells them 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 we're just going to enter the minecraft 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.190
 pocket edition and good here once we 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.810
 let's go to the adjustments to those of the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.440
 skins we are going to give him 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.930
 personalized we go to the gallery and go 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.590
 to go where we keep it that is for 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.000
 download defect that does not appear 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.550
 if it does not come to appear for some 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.390
 reason they are going to move it to a folder where 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.090
 you know or are going to move it to the root 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.780
 of your sd card now let's look 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.090
 around here the downloads folder here is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.550
 let's move the skin that we made that is 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.580
 we are going to copy it so as not to lose 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 time let's give it there and once done 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.360
 that we're going to go back to minecraft that 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.950
 see here we will return to the microphone 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.590
 we will return to outside gallery 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.630
 again there and once here we go to 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.120
 find the skin that we made that is 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.270
 this is basically there and they are seeing 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.100
 This can be done very easy and good 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.470
 if they give you like they subscribe it says it 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.940
 I would appreciate the application too much 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.210
 in the description and until next 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.210
