 a series that presents you the drama to 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.790
 another level is my favorite series and it has 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.860
 a super well-crafted story because 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.080
 in the other series more or less 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.599
 you know what's going to happen that this one goes by 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.099
 there and good is going to find it you know 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.019
 pretty much what's going to happen already I'll 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.420
 you wait bye but in this what you think 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.340
 that will happen never ever happens to you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 surprise it is a band of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.390
 motorcyclists who are dedicated to be 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.489
 mechanics have their workshop but in turn 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.349
 they have some shady deals all 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.269
 begins when the son of the 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.250
 protagonist and the protagonist like that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.260
 it becomes more sensitive and begins to have 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.360
 bending with its same band 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.370
 motorcyclists because there are other 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.500
 bands that then there is conflict at 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.690
 violence and then the protagonist as 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.579
