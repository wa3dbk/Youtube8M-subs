00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.060 
thought in my mind I'm not bullshitting
about<00:04:52.120> this<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.540> is<00:04:52.720> exactly<00:04:53.200> what<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.650> taught

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
about this this is exactly what I taught

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.750 
about this this is exactly what I taught
at<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.400> particular<00:04:54.610> moment<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.800> knew<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.220> is

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
at that particular moment I knew that is

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.610 
at that particular moment I knew that is
going<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.060> be<00:04:58.150> something<00:04:58.389> about<00:04:58.750> aces<00:04:59.260> double

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
going to be something about aces double

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.960 
going to be something about aces double
from<00:04:59.800> because<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.940> words<00:05:01.350> special<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.970> the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
from because the words special and the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.440 
from because the words special and the
Flamingo<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:05.020> was<00:05:05.290> just<00:05:05.530> like<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.150> has<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.330> be

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
Flamingo it was just like it has to be

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.770 
Flamingo it was just like it has to be
that<00:05:07.479> it<00:05:08.050> has<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.500> be<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:09.520> trap<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.240> he's

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
that it has to be the trap that he's

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.850 
that it has to be the trap that he's
setting<00:05:11.139> up<00:05:11.290> for<00:05:11.500> luffy<00:05:11.950> basically<00:05:12.810> putting

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
setting up for luffy basically putting

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.370

aces devil fruit on display so that he

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.900 
aces devil fruit on display so that he
can<00:05:17.560> lure<00:05:17.740> out<00:05:19.169> luffy<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.740> seems<00:05:21.100> because
