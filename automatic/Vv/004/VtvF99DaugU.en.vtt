00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hello and welcome are further meant meant to great 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.630
 Today I'll show you what you are all about 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.889
 Redstone can do 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.889
 and some of us are already waiting eagerly for it 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.579
 First of all, this is a Brett Stone Roux block 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 Actually we are not so funny 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 It should be quite normal if you put the invasion 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.109
 to blink in the past and joined in 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.769
 it takes a bit of a break 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.490
 and that's just a bit more growth than a species 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.880
 then show that's what you can do with it 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.210
 for example 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.470
 depend on it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.220
 1 confess 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.670
 and there in the Redstone over it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 Life Ball or to the opening credits sleep research 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 maybe still need 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 I need 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.320
 submit 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.980
 and last round ended 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.660
 No, I freezed 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.060
 is he made mistakes and that is not redeeming 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 particularities 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.710
 it is wood 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 not binding my mistake 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200
 then you have a notebook 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.940
 like her 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.900
 Smoking up there is an entrance that is equally beautiful 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
 then there is murder 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 I would have to mine 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 So here you want to be the Mimin then think with the compass 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 and Erwin locks iron 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 then just take gold 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 Tampa plans or forged 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.130
 Now we are going around 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 a few beautiful ones 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.339
 Paul Green IT 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.339
 Come back later to something more exact place 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 then there is still him 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.079
 Detector Engels 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
 But you do not do it with gold but with prices 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.739
 should the GÃ¶rlitz 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.739
 I'll make myself a few 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 dpa and what you can still 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.489
 Hagen to murder 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.139
 schoolchildren 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.779
 because 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.779
 the duo us too 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.039
 fount 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.229
 Rolf Schieder 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 but I have already lost it 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 if there is more excuses but am 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.579
 I do not care about the fast nothing I watch Money makes love 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.589
 to 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:24.299
 "I have Inter well and I noticed the Wars 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.909
 There is really very little that you can do with me 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.169
 and tax 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.169
 but you can currently do the opposite 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.219
 Well, anyway, thanks for watching 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.109
 and percent off 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.109
 Do not forget comments 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.279
 and as the division you get the first videos
