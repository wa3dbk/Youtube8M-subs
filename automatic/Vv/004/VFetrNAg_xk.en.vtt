00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
really love about this LED light is what

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
really love about this LED light is what
we<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.110> course<00:01:55.290> 96<00:01:55.950> LEDs

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
we have here it is of course 96 LEDs

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.120 
we have here it is of course 96 LEDs
with<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.270> magnets<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> front<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.009> these

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
with these magnets on the front so these

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.480 
with these magnets on the front so these
two<00:01:59.430> filters<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.130> easily

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
two filters you see there and easily

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990 
two filters you see there and easily
snap<00:02:02.909> them<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.520> goes<00:02:05.729> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
snap them on and the other one goes on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.749 
snap them on and the other one goes on
exact<00:02:06.899> same<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.399> just<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
exact same way just like that

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
exact same way just like that
so<00:02:10.360> no<00:02:10.539> more<00:02:10.689> losing<00:02:10.929> your<00:02:11.230> filters<00:02:11.620> just

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so no more losing your filters just

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.089 
so no more losing your filters just
simply<00:02:12.159> snap<00:02:12.459> them<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.819> there<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.140> on

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
simply snap them on there you have it on

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.890 
simply snap them on there you have it on
the<00:02:15.220> bottom<00:02:15.519> here<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.819> have<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.180> threads<00:02:16.569> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the bottom here we have the threads to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.149 
the bottom here we have the threads to
mount<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.459> adapter<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.329> hot<00:02:19.510> shoe<00:02:20.159> let's

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
mount the adapter for the hot shoe let's

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.399 
mount the adapter for the hot shoe let's
go<00:02:21.250> ahead<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.459> screw<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.879> light<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.269> here<00:02:25.409> and

have the on and off switch you can also

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.699 
have the on and off switch you can also
control<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.670> lighting<00:02:34.329> for<00:02:35.260> highest<00:02:35.470> output

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
control the lighting for highest output

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.000 
control the lighting for highest output
lower<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.549> shut<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.359> off<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:38.379> also<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.799> an
