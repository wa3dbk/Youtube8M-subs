animations by EA sports and dumb and
they<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.060> people<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.689> sort<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they some people don't like the sort of

the<00:01:55.020> real<00:01:55.200> life<00:01:55.439> stadiums<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the real life stadiums but in a way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
the real life stadiums but in a way
that's<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.390> set<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> animations<00:01:58.439> but

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that's all set up and the animations but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
that's all set up and the animations but
I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:59.250> they're<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.430> cool<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.909> ed<00:02:00.659> etihad

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I think they're really cool so ed etihad

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.569 
I think they're really cool so ed etihad
looks<00:02:01.200> quite<00:02:01.350> good<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.100> first<00:02:02.310> chance<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
looks quite good and the first chance of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.310 
looks quite good and the first chance of
the<00:02:02.640> game<00:02:02.700> came<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.240> city<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.750> saved<00:02:04.049> by<00:02:04.259> an

possibly<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.160> slight<00:02:38.880> chance<00:02:39.330> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
possibly there was a slight chance of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.940 
possibly there was a slight chance of
heart<00:02:39.600> gettin<00:02:39.930> tight<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> see<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.860> he

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
heart gettin tight you see just there he

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.460 
heart gettin tight you see just there he
kind<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.160> stops<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.850> then<00:02:42.750> he<00:02:42.900> tries<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> dive

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
kind of stops and then he tries to dive

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
kind of stops and then he tries to dive
and<00:02:43.680> he<00:02:43.739> doesn't<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.250> maybe<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:44.850> you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and he doesn't get to it maybe if you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
and he doesn't get to it maybe if you
were<00:02:45.060> dives<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.660> took<00:02:45.930> all<00:02:46.050> his<00:02:46.200> momentum

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
were dives and took all his momentum

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
were dives and took all his momentum
with<00:02:46.860> him<00:02:46.980> he<00:02:47.400> could<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.760> got<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
with him he could have got to it but I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
with him he could have got to it but I
can<00:02:48.780> see<00:02:48.959> why<00:02:49.110> he<00:02:49.140> didn't<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.650> obviously<00:02:49.830> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
can see why he didn't and obviously so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.130 
can see why he didn't and obviously so

like<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.470> difficult<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.459> I

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
like it's it is difficult and you know I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.699 
like it's it is difficult and you know I
used<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.510> playing<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.989> when<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.230> play<00:04:01.530> football

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
used to playing go when I play football

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.380 
used to playing go when I play football
so<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.100> know<00:04:02.190> how<00:04:02.400> hard<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.760> position<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.239> is

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
so I know how hard of a position it is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.080 
so I know how hard of a position it is
but<00:04:03.690> even<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> greatest<00:04:05.010> header<00:04:05.160> isn't

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
but even so in the greatest header isn't

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.759 
but even so in the greatest header isn't
right<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> corner<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.260> nine<00:04:07.440> Lee<00:04:07.560> gets<00:04:07.709> a

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
right in the corner and nine Lee gets a

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.470 
right in the corner and nine Lee gets a
strong<00:04:08.190> hand<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.670> i<00:04:08.790> thought<00:04:09.060> he<00:04:09.180> possibly

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
strong hand on it i thought he possibly

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.819 
strong hand on it i thought he possibly
could<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:09.810> saved<00:04:10.049> instead<00:04:10.500> he<00:04:10.560> tip<00:04:10.739> toe

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
could have saved instead he tip toe

Rooney who gets an injury so Rooney goes
down<00:06:26.490> he's<00:06:26.760> injured<00:06:27.150> and<00:06:27.390> you<00:06:27.870> know<00:06:28.170> we<00:06:28.320> won't

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
down he's injured and you know we won't

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.660 
down he's injured and you know we won't
know<00:06:28.620> for<00:06:28.650> sure<00:06:28.950> but<00:06:29.130> I'd<00:06:29.220> imagine<00:06:29.580> i'll

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
know for sure but I'd imagine i'll

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.830

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.050 
probably put them up for the FA Cup
final<00:06:30.870> so<00:06:31.560> this<00:06:32.070> is<00:06:32.190> exactly<00:06:32.580> why<00:06:32.850> I<00:06:32.910> decided

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
final so this is exactly why I decided

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.850 
final so this is exactly why I decided
to<00:06:33.300> rest<00:06:33.480> the<00:06:33.600> entire<00:06:33.870> side<00:06:34.170> so<00:06:34.350> Rooney<00:06:34.680> gets

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
to rest the entire side so Rooney gets

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.440 
to rest the entire side so Rooney gets
injured<00:06:35.130> and<00:06:35.250> that's<00:06:35.370> probably<00:06:35.550> wonder<00:06:35.970> you

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
injured and that's probably wonder you

honest it's also going to be a very

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.520 
honest it's also going to be a very
difficult<00:07:06.030> game<00:07:06.270> for<00:07:06.450> us<00:07:06.510> facing<00:07:06.750> United<00:07:07.320> and

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
difficult game for us facing United and

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.130 
difficult game for us facing United and
especially<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:08.640> fact<00:07:08.760> we<00:07:08.940> made<00:07:09.360> 11<00:07:09.750> changes

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
especially the fact we made 11 changes

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.780 
especially the fact we made 11 changes
as<00:07:10.230> well<00:07:10.410> it<00:07:10.710> was<00:07:11.100> always<00:07:11.340> getting<00:07:11.520> really

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
as well it was always getting really

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.550 
as well it was always getting really
difficult<00:07:11.940> for<00:07:12.180> us<00:07:12.420> and<00:07:12.660> too<00:07:13.140> much<00:07:13.230> we

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
difficult for us and too much we

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.660 
difficult for us and too much we
probably<00:07:13.800> got<00:07:13.980> the<00:07:14.070> best<00:07:14.100> really<00:07:14.520> could<00:07:14.640> have

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
probably got the best really could have

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.940 
probably got the best really could have
had<00:07:14.850> realistically<00:07:15.420> you<00:07:15.600> know<00:07:15.720> a<00:07:15.960> draw<00:07:16.710> a

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:16.950
