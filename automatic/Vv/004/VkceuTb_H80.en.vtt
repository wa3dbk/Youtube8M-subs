00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.150
 let's just take this video 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 for example, the console rhi of the plane 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 delta alpha in the charlie kilo 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.509
 if you click on the icon click here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 make a preview like the airplane 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 you can see it then download 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 get here on the left and you get there 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.200
 has so download for aerosoft forum 140 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.409
 you sign up register what I am 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.579
 have already done it 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.799
 here on download you have to agree 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.460
 and then download it here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.460
 download 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:19.920
 this will take a few seconds like this 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.690
 then then we have to follow here 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.650
 now once the folder clean virgin 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.349
 there would be 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.310
 update but firmly ends the 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.550
 thumbnails and a draw the virgin 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.470
 the clean version is the plane 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.900
 looks like it is fresh 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 from the airbus works and would never have been 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.420
 been flown 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 there will be version 5 on the other hand 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.110
 looks like he has been away for a long time 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:54.569
 time has been in operation so has one 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:57.959
 few contributions so reason yes 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.549
 we open the corresponding folder of the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.170
 install aircraft per version 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.299
 in our case, airbus a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.120
 320 cfm we open this for the video 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.280
 Here I take the choice between and we 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.750
 copy 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.959
 the tech the folder in here 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.890
 next you want to be in essex 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.100
 You ended up here in updater sex scene 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 turn and copy the files here goes 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.790
 here in the condor folder rhine and 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.370
 4 1 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 This one makes for all conflict and 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.910
 the files then that was pretty easy it 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.959
 must be remembered is the plane for the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.500
 inherit that this is that livery for 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.540
 the rb6 extended written and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.739
 was developed and that therefore has too 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.829
 this kicker file is in there 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.190
 is outdated and the fix is ​​copied 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.639
 Just use the textfile of one 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.340
 current plane or one with the 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:10.560
 Rent the airplane you copied 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.100
 then and then put her a coup in 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.100
 underwear 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:24.560
 and then you have to be the last one 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:27.910
 Copy the farewell from the readme and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.930
 then into the aircraft fifty nine 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:39.290
 sown install I have here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:42.740
 then install some apps then then 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.630
 you insert that here and put the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.340
 flights mx number through the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.210
 corresponding ford following number in 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.580
 my trap the 13 and then saves 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.740
 one that it goes accordingly from then 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.490
 then we go to ours 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:06.830
 Flight simulator and choose a new one 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:09.500
 plane from this you will find here 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.880
 But then what is it often here? 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.830
 airbus xtra 20 and so on and goes 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.930
 that here too under the aircraft 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.310
 manufacturer a new thing is in fact 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.110

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.480
 If you find this disturbing, you can do so 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.130
 quite simply change in the aircraft fcsg 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.410

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.730
 We have installed the name change 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.730
 and just remove the iks and 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.650
 Company effectively we remove that 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:52.450
 ixs saved the surfaces again 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.450
 and we go with a flight simulator 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.790
 change the current plane again 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.820
 then we find our condor plane 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.550
