00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi you like me i want to introduce 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 your project is robotic 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.599
 microscope pay attention to the screen 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.690
 laptop 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 there you can see how to focus the image 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 this remote control one of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.970
 lenses for chronically camera drive 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.699
 with the highest zoom lens 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 engine driven this shift system 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.840
 items tables now i'm changing 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.840
 microscope using android tablet 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 mobile platform transports 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 a fragment of this system to the webcam 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.719
 and this is how students see this process 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.840
 classroom image from presentation 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 the microscope is transmitted to the projector here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.629
 you see part of a biology lesson by topic 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.180
 root main organs of a plant can 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 see the usual root of its natural 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.619
 medium root hairs with large 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.619
 increasing 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 linden heel rank with an average increase 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 here you can control how our screen 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.950
 see the newsgroup participants I 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.950
 I prepare a temporary microslide 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 we see rotifers rotifers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.830
 smallest among multicellular 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.270
 their body length is from 1 100 to 2 and a half 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.820
 millimeters but look how they are 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.800
 look under the microscope on the head 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.470
 contained around the military apparatus 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.470
 which consists of two rows of cilia
