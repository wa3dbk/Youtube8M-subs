the right of way for the Dulles metro
rail<00:00:09.990> face<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.650> project<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:12.170> two<00:00:13.170> stations

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
rail face to project the two stations

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.210 
rail face to project the two stations
along<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.950> Dulles<00:00:14.370> Greenway

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220

so<00:00:58.610> here's<00:00:58.820> where<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.060> first<00:00:59.300> survey<00:00:59.810> markers

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
so here's where the first survey markers

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.870 
so here's where the first survey markers
and<00:01:00.590> that's<00:01:00.740> where<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.070> tracks<00:01:01.340> will<00:01:01.550> come<00:01:01.730> in

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
and that's where the tracks will come in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.120 
and that's where the tracks will come in
and<00:01:02.000> off<00:01:02.150> in<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.510> airport<00:01:03.200> property<00:01:03.470> onto<00:01:03.890> the

as you can see they've got the barrels

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.800 
as you can see they've got the barrels
out<00:01:09.550> if<00:01:10.330> any<00:01:10.810> survey<00:01:11.260> markers<00:01:11.500> down<00:01:12.810> most

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
right here is the west ox road overpass

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.469 
right here is the west ox road overpass
and<00:01:43.929> then<00:01:44.259> right<00:01:44.770> along<00:01:45.219> at<00:01:45.490> least<00:01:45.520> area<00:01:46.179> is

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
and then right along at least area is

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.050 
and then right along at least area is
where<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.020> route<00:01:47.499> 606<00:01:48.219> nation<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.819> supposed

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
where the route 606 nation is supposed

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:07.250 
where the route 606 nation is supposed
to<00:01:49.210> be

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.080 

here's<00:02:07.830> where<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.160> tracks<00:02:08.430> will<00:02:08.640> cross<00:02:08.880> over

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
here's where the tracks will cross over

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:21.750 
here's where the tracks will cross over
broad<00:02:09.570> run<00:02:09.869> three

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.640 

just<00:02:22.390> transmission<00:02:23.049> lines<00:02:23.260> right<00:02:23.620> here

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
just transmission lines right here

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.600 
just transmission lines right here
connected<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.379> dulles<00:02:26.379> greenway

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
connected to the dulles greenway

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.949 
connected to the dulles greenway
substation<00:02:27.610> which<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.000> where<00:02:28.269> bedroom<00:02:28.780> will

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
substation which is where bedroom will

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:45.570 
substation which is where bedroom will
be<00:02:28.989> getting<00:02:29.379> some<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.650> its<00:02:29.680> power<00:02:30.010> from

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

large<00:02:46.240> data<00:02:46.540> sent<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.050> them<00:02:47.110> right<00:02:47.350> here

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.720 

so<00:03:21.050> over<00:03:21.320> here<00:03:21.350> off<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.980> right<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.490> large

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
so over here off to the right is a large

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.450 
so over here off to the right is a large
adult<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.690> taking<00:03:24.170> place<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.800> right<00:03:25.100> here<00:03:25.340> in

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
adult is taking place and right here in

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.120 
adult is taking place and right here in
the<00:03:25.550> median<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.090> where<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.480> brat<00:03:26.720> 772<00:03:27.650> station

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
the median is where the brat 772 station

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.990 
the median is where the brat 772 station
is<00:03:28.250> supposed<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.670> be<00:03:29.770> Ryan<00:03:30.770> rode<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.760> last

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
is supposed to be Ryan rode the last

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.090 
is supposed to be Ryan rode the last
station

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.670 

then<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.150> tracks<00:03:44.450> continue

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.350 

but<00:03:49.310> lead

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
but lead

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.680 
but lead
this<00:03:51.690> bridge<00:03:51.990> right<00:03:52.020> here

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.140 

and<00:03:57.110> then<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> last<00:03:57.620> survey<00:03:58.160> bar<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.880> over

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and then the last survey bar is over

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.850 
and then the last survey bar is over
here<00:03:59.360> on<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.600> right<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.200> that's<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.590> extent

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
here on the right so that's the extent

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.490 
here on the right so that's the extent
of<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.070> project<00:04:01.720> that's<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.990> existing

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
of the project that's the existing

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.830 
of the project that's the existing
conditions<00:04:04.100> right<00:04:04.340> now<00:04:04.370> heavy<00:04:05.120> construction

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
conditions right now heavy construction

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.100 
conditions right now heavy construction
is<00:04:06.290> supposed<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.620> be<00:04:06.740> getting<00:04:06.860> started

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
is supposed to be getting started

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.960 
is supposed to be getting started
beginning<00:04:09.110> next<00:04:09.260> year<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:10.400> i'll<00:04:10.820> have

beginning next year and i'll have

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.510 
beginning next year and i'll have
another<00:04:11.570> video<00:04:11.810> update<00:04:12.350> then<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.220> thanks<00:04:13.490> for

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
another video update then so thanks for

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.090 
another video update then so thanks for
watching
