00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello, my name is April de GavÃ  

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.850
 technologies in this video we are going to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.099
 talk about start files or profiles in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.290
 English as we had been talking in the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.469
 previous class of the rights of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.660
 users the permissions of the users and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.690
 we were talking about groups now let's go 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.520
 to talk about profiles without voice well you know 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 when you sit in front of your 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 computer for example in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 your home computer you like 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 get certain icons in the background 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.050
 of certain screen accesses 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.660
 direct certain documents by hand 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 and when you go to another computer 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 person who can be a family member has 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.780
 different things on your computer 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 then different wallpaper 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.840
 different access different documents 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 etcetera then every computer is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.629
 differently what happens when you 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.969
 you are in a house that there are several 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 members usually each have 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 your username and password 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 then when it comes for example the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.680
 parent uses his user when 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.480
 have the wife come when the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 wife uses her user and there 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.240
 when the children come, everyone has 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.160
 your own users 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 all with username and password 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.630
 out there only the user only 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.060
 no passwords but good what you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.950
 I want to say is that everyone personalizes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 computers differently 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.440
 then we have two types of profiles 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 we have profiles that are local and 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.370
 the profiles that are in the network like 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 we can see here we have local and the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.410
 Local networks are what you can see is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.620
 why in a family house like you 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.720
 I said recently and those profiles are saved 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.180
 only on that computer if you go 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 to another computer that is out there 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.100
 the same house obviously those profiles 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 they are not maintained no matter how much you use 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.430
 the same username and user 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 password that you had on the computer 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.810
 number one on computer number two 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.440
 you will not have the same things in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.230
 change when you save profiles in the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.480
 network on a server for example 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.790
 of active directory or therefore in a 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.340
 falsetto where one wants to save this 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.200
 type of profiles 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.840
 when one changes computers 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.910
 for example in a company that there are 500 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.150
 computers there are going to be 500 profiles 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.200
 then when the manager of that 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.329
 company moves 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.909
 office or even change computer 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.950
 whatever it is always go where you go and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.290
 where it is achieved with its user always goes 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.110
 to have your computer in the way that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 he wants then suppose that the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 Manager changes office as I told you or 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.739
 out there the computer breaks down and leaves 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 to work , they will give you another 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.720
 new computer automatically 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.849
 then the using his name 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.220
 user and his password automatically 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.349
 he's going to have all his things in the way 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.940
 that he had them on the computer 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.060
 previous this is what can help you 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.129
 is in not having to be configuring the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.799
 manager's computer all again 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.170
 from zero and we would save a lot of 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.060
 time then this kind of thing are 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.079
 fundamentals and more for the world 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.569
 corporate in which time is gold or the 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.090
 time is money obviously then not 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.069
 no time to lose because if you a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.959
 manager you say look here you have the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.970
 computer but I have to configure 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.120
 everything back to pass the files and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.160
 all that hours and hours that you can get 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.170
 to delay that process is a loss 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.210
 important for the company in which 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.250
 the managers of large companies 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.920
 obviously they generate a lot of money for that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.960
 company and every second counts then 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.970
 you have to try to have this kind of 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.940
 things optimized in the best possible way 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.700
 to avoid these kinds of problems now 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.920
 I'm going to tell you six of the items that 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.750
 I have here so you know the benefits 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.640
 of each one for example let's talk 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.100
 from point number one that in the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.040
 wallpaper or desktop setting 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.660
 what would be the wallpaper the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.890
 screen saver what would be 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.720
 screensaver or colors when you save 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.270
 all this kind of stuff in the profiles 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.090
 obviously it does not matter what 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.250
 computer you're after the menu 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.100
 home is exactly the same thing out there 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.920
 if in the start menu of the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.840
 windows one put certain icons and 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.550
 the organs in certain ways that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.040
 it is still maintained after 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.260
 favorites are obviously kept the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.990
 documents also the configuration of 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.600
 the network the mapping of the units all 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.430
 about the network obviously even the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.060
 printers after my documents 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.150
 as well 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.380
 and what would be point number 6 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.750
 configuration of the programs all are 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.310
 It keeps exactly what's there 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.910
 what to keep in mind is something very 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.940
 important if one has a company with 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.919
 500 computers what is important is 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.710
 have all the computers with the 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.440
 same programs because what happens in 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.050
 the profiles what you keep are files 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.690
 and all the configuration of your system 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.150
 but what happens if you for example in the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.729
 computer number one you have the office 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.430
 complete what would be word excel power 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.139
 point publishers and that kind of thing and 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.660
 pumps the computer to number two 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.560
 that you see there having that computer not 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.300
 you do not have the office installed 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.190
 obviously you will not be able to open all 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.840
 the documents that you had in the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.940
 computer number one while the 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.700
 files will be but if you do not 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.010
 you have the program to open the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.260
 light pub files or power point 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.120
 the word excell obviously that person does not 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.300
 going to work then is fundamental 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.919
 that you have the same applications 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.800
 installed on all computers 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.030
 to avoid this kind of problem this 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.010
 type of profiles are called in English 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.400
 roaming profile that means that one 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.650
 can move computers and save 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.500
 all configuration files and everything 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.390
 that I just explained to you earlier 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.900
 this is obviously fundamental in 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.320
 companies and in places where time 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.870
 it's worth a lot and that one needs to be able 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.970
 work wherever you go and have all 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.669
 his things obviously this works 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.600
 within the same network because if not 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.210
 has to pass giant files of 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.580
 server to desktop pc is 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.720
 fundamental that is in a medium that 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.270
 it could be 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.970
 generated and copied all these files 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.220
 quickly and efficiently I hope that 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.230
 you liked this class and see you 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.570

 subscribe and you will be able to see more videos 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.710
 like this every week and if you want

 see other videos that I have about 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.660
 different topics click on any of

 the playlists or also 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.880
 you can search by topics by clicking on 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.470
 the search magnifying glass and writing the 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.730
 video that you want to find in my 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.800
 list of videos 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.700
 thanks for watching this video and see you
