 the accused 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.019
 when marcel robert i use the common rocket launcher 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.310

 the only class 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 what class of mutual reproaches the forum privilege when 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.930
 even 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.530
 at matignon 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.200
 featherweight asset

 vim 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 enjoy 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.430
 bc douvrin trot mounted 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.670
 connected like a sick franklin especially in the middle of the nation the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.930
 something to perfect ap 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 it is necessary for his action to say that we were 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.030
 comic law 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.240
 so we play moreover in May in demolition in the match 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.209
 and to know it's a heap first part 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.650
 since 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.240
 since that day in since we are 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.429
 since we returned from a median vacation package of emergency help 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.040
 I can say that it is really 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.580
 it's really weird 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 you see stop chewing my words I'm too young boy 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.339
 valence passes

 m 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.439
 Korea 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.529
 the company in the championship we are used to 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.989
 m how young people like such an emptiness 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.480
 frd the sort in the pop song or we do not know why we know 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.009
 it's like that 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.799
 this other world that my rights to 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.129
 finally the little defect of this studio sec in fact 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.539
 the thing is, you can go and have 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:41.799
 solid 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.099
 and not to put bullets 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.940
 not for example I have already plunged more than 3% I will resign to ten 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:48.609
 meters 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.730
 and to have 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.229
 sleight of hand 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.989
 they were targeting places 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.119
 he is helping the team for santander 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:02.329
 could you novel that me a little debate of meters 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.349
 she is sublime 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.759
 it's happening on this place 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.869
 the fact that he called it will be the same for me 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.949
 it's a bit like that 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.209
 it is to be at his side 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.169
 the couple sees reinforced 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.179
 we can align lakes 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:23.729
 of law doubt in this place while having a sleight of hand which is enough 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.159
 pity 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.729
 in England 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.729
 r to leave the bed is solid 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.579
 see for example the rocket launcher 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.439
 you have to use it but 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.449
 Why 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.449
 really in the 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.829
 it is only when the opportunity arises 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.829
 what five years old who has already killed in this super slow 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.329
 laughs 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.259
 which refers to black Africa 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.259
 in boys diarrhea 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 to use it anyway you still need a minimum of experience 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.459
 a clash to serve 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.340
 initial parachute added 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.340
 I do not do anything 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.559
 in the township we've been reeking for 25 years 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.860
 opposite the stylists 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.499
 I'm sorry website purepeople com my dear bailly 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.379
 at the front 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.860
 if on this page she is almost 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.729
 enough is enough 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.279
 a draw would be rather flattering to change his vehicle 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.979
 ap 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.800
 girls 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.620
 I continue dear 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.449
 I'm going to kill you 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.449
 my destiny in hand symposiums etc 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.819
 the napalm 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
 so see him walking as many movies 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.089
 we will take the opportunity to make this type of china 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.370
 dogs are a component 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.960
 woerth however we can see in this sense 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.960
 center of manama I only have three cartridges same place 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.520
 for who 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.629
 rare 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.809
 montebourg - the great silence m 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.619
 in this collection which therefore passes in relation to many of their areas 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.330
 Why 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.760
 What is it 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.760
 in France it's clear it's a dancer one by one on this plane ozone 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.869
 you say you kept the word to be so they are 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.169
 that's why there's a little over 11% tickets then the technique 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.879
 striking grenade launcher or osteoarthritis 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.059
 as we can see the match 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:28.059
 qED 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.339
 in this world 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.489
 Holland sees big we see that it would explode when attached 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.389
 on 100 m two explodes 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.419
 it's very simple we exploded them 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.180
