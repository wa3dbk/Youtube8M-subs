00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.560
 on the list preview of the street the cidi said leg 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.930
 flight to Schiphol it's a recognition for the end 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.049
 the city becomes very large after it has the diameter of feyenoord against a large screen 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.169
 with 3 x 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.579
 but you should not be high enough 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.239
 In addition, an aluminum has been made except for a few spots 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.770
 is not nice that it is not really nice but stuck during the duel 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.869
 and thereby 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.539
 is a lot better than true 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.339
 the other two telephones 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.150
 look in the usa 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.060
 That device even comes after linesman she actually had with the SS 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.270
 in the U.S 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.470
 from a few affected this 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.410
 now and then you have to bite location budget and location service 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.530
 they do not work well but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.590
 it is handy at the top of google maps in some cases of users 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 but mint union on tonight 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.070
 that works a huge number of applications that exist 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 and that is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.239
 think of a double benefit 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.390
 also a disadvantage 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.480
 because you 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.950
 picasa or not good can find that also applies to settings 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 for example, you can change a theme 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 a theme like this 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 evides are as we know them 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.370
 and you need other settings 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.390
 really do settings 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 and quite a bit sorry that it is not that handy 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 in crates and then it is usually done 6 big problem 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.700
 then the government debt runs additional functions they see on the back the 8 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 megapixel camera 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 actually takes good photos of their landline 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.270
 He bit the man, assuming that they did this 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 after a short time this is the best 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 the tail of the device are good 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 the internet news just means being put 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.710
 people are perhaps slightly less than expected with some 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.050
 applications task that 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.780
 He is always at the top of the market 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 that was that
