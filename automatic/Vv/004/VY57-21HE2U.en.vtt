know<00:00:29.320> we<00:00:29.470> were<00:00:29.529> going<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.710> be<00:00:29.800> here<00:00:29.830> doing<00:00:30.160> this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
know we were going to be here doing this

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.259 
know we were going to be here doing this
and<00:00:30.789> this<00:00:31.570> idea<00:00:31.840> of<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:33.190> bringing<00:00:33.790> those<00:00:33.910> media

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
and this idea of of bringing those media

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.240 
and this idea of of bringing those media
together<00:00:34.629> you<00:00:35.170> know<00:00:35.260> TVs<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:35.860> everybody's

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
together you know TVs and everybody's

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.970 
together you know TVs and everybody's
home<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:37.300> we<00:00:37.420> play<00:00:37.629> our<00:00:37.660> games<00:00:38.050> generally<00:00:38.559> on

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
home and we play our games generally on

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.560 
home and we play our games generally on
our<00:00:39.220> TV<00:00:39.460> at<00:00:39.910> home<00:00:40.769> it's<00:00:41.769> a<00:00:42.040> natural<00:00:42.430> fit<00:00:43.000> but

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
our TV at home it's a natural fit but

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.240 
our TV at home it's a natural fit but
it's<00:00:43.720> all<00:00:44.229> I<00:00:44.290> think<00:00:44.589> it's<00:00:44.680> always<00:00:44.920> seems<00:00:45.159> so

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
it's all I think it's always seems so

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's all I think it's always seems so
complicated<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.750> difficult<00:00:47.199> to<00:00:47.409> do<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.860> you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
complicated so difficult to do that you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.490 
complicated so difficult to do that you
know<00:00:48.940> it's<00:00:49.089> been<00:00:49.239> beyond<00:00:49.659> the<00:00:50.019> realm<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
know it's been beyond the realm of the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.100 
know it's been beyond the realm of the
possible<00:00:50.769> and<00:00:51.250> what<00:00:51.760> try<00:00:52.089> on<00:00:52.330> and<00:00:52.479> sci-fi<00:00:52.720> have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
possible and what try on and sci-fi have

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.890 
possible and what try on and sci-fi have
done<00:00:53.260> is<00:00:53.519> tackle<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.850> honestly<00:00:55.659> think<00:00:55.809> it's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
done is tackle it I honestly think it's

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.570 
done is tackle it I honestly think it's
the<00:00:56.019> most<00:00:56.199> exciting<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.799> know<00:00:56.830> exciting<00:00:57.460> way

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
the most exciting you know exciting way

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.149 
the most exciting you know exciting way
to<00:00:57.610> synthesize<00:00:57.909> to<00:00:58.449> completely<00:00:59.159> previously

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
to synthesize to completely previously

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.590 
to synthesize to completely previously
separate<00:01:00.580> media<00:01:00.909> that<00:01:01.059> I've<00:01:01.180> ever<00:01:01.239> heard<00:01:01.449> of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
separate media that I've ever heard of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.299 
separate media that I've ever heard of
then<00:01:02.320> talk<00:01:02.589> a<00:01:02.619> lot<00:01:02.830> about<00:01:02.890> your<00:01:03.250> character

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
then talk a lot about your character

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.219 
then talk a lot about your character
because<00:01:03.879> you're<00:01:04.030> both<00:01:04.180> virtual<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:04.690> then<00:01:05.110> on

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
because you're both virtual and then on

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.109 
because you're both virtual and then on
a<00:01:05.260> TV<00:01:05.500> show<00:01:05.619> as<00:01:05.950> well<00:01:06.100> yeah<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.610> can't<00:01:06.880> keep<00:01:07.000> up

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
off in the video game and then he goes

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.180 
off in the video game and then he goes
into<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.910> series<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.510> you<00:01:19.720> can<00:01:19.900> actually

into the series and you can actually

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.730 
into the series and you can actually
when<00:01:21.190> we<00:01:21.310> launched<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.790> video<00:01:21.970> game<00:01:22.740> there's

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
when we launched the video game there's

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.400 
when we launched the video game there's
a<00:01:23.860> point<00:01:24.100> where<00:01:24.340> Nolan<00:01:24.790> leaves<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:26.130> then

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
a point where Nolan leaves and then

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.600 
a point where Nolan leaves and then
exactly<00:01:29.410> in<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.560> way<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.190> begin<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
exactly in that way we begin the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.610 
exactly in that way we begin the
television<00:01:31.120> series<00:01:31.300> so<00:01:31.840> right<00:01:32.170> from<00:01:32.200> the

television series so right from the
beginning<00:01:32.940> there's<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.030> synthesis<00:01:34.570> between

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
beginning there's a synthesis between

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.600 
beginning there's a synthesis between
the<00:01:35.020> two<00:01:35.170> right<00:01:35.740> from<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:35.950> beginning<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.400> two

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the two right from the beginning the two

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.510 
the two right from the beginning the two
universes<00:01:37.510> are<00:01:37.660> one<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.110> two<00:01:38.740> worlds<00:01:39.190> of<00:01:39.310> game

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
universes are one the two worlds of game

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460

and<00:01:39.730> show<00:01:39.940> are<00:01:40.240> connected<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.810> they'll<00:01:41.260> stay

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and show are connected and they'll stay

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.830 
and show are connected and they'll stay
that<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.909> was<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.120> like<00:01:43.210> for<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.420> going
