you're<00:00:01.709> making<00:00:02.100> yourself<00:00:02.460> up<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.820> frame<00:00:03.149> out

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
you're making yourself up the frame out

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.539 
you're making yourself up the frame out
of<00:00:03.929> angle<00:00:04.319> iron<00:00:04.410> or<00:00:04.890> something<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
of angle iron or something this is a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.320 
of angle iron or something this is a
piece<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.879> aluminium<00:00:06.000> just<00:00:06.919> to<00:00:07.919> demonstrate

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
piece of aluminium just to demonstrate

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.780 
piece of aluminium just to demonstrate
and<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> bend<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.050> at<00:00:10.170> 90<00:00:10.980> degrees<00:00:11.370> so

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and you want to bend it at 90 degrees so

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.709 
and you want to bend it at 90 degrees so
you<00:00:12.780> cut<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> slot<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:14.330> when<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.420> draw<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you cut a slot out when you draw the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.179 
you cut a slot out when you draw the
anything<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:17.029> you've<00:00:18.029> taken<00:00:18.330> enough<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:19.189> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
anything up you've taken enough out so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.210 
anything up you've taken enough out so
you<00:00:20.250> take<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.699> more<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.769> when<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.830> bend<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you take a bit more out when you bend it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
you take a bit more out when you bend it
further<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:25.199> find<00:00:25.410> you've<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> gap<00:00:27.380> sound

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
further you find you've got a gap sound

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.210 
further you find you've got a gap sound
familiar

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
familiar

well<00:00:29.849> perhaps<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.650> making<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:31.859> common

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
well perhaps you're making a very common

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.020 
well perhaps you're making a very common
mistake

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
mistake

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.720 
mistake
and<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:34.140> I've<00:00:34.290> marked<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.640> should<00:00:35.880> do

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
and here I've marked what you should do

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
and here I've marked what you should do
is<00:00:38.730> work<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.660> thickness<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.500> thickness

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
is work out the thickness the thickness

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.720 
is work out the thickness the thickness
of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> material<00:00:42.620> do<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> baseline<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> then

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of the material do a baseline and then

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the material do a baseline and then
draw<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.090> 45<00:00:45.899> degree<00:00:46.320> 45<00:00:46.649> degree<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.180> right

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
draw your 45 degree 45 degree to a right

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080 
draw your 45 degree 45 degree to a right
angle<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.129> you've<00:00:50.129> done<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> first

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
angle and you've done it right the first

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
angle and you've done it right the first
time<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> couple<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> exposed<00:00:55.550> white

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
time I have a couple of exposed white

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.260 
time I have a couple of exposed white
fittings<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.899> porch<00:00:58.199> way<00:00:58.440> roof

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
fittings like this in my porch way roof

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
fittings like this in my porch way roof
and<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> greatly<00:01:00.750> adds<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.469> collection

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and that greatly adds to my collection

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.719 
and that greatly adds to my collection
of<00:01:02.100> insects<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> thought<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.519> I've<00:01:05.580> got

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
of insects so I thought well I've got

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
of insects so I thought well I've got
enough<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> decided<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.530> put<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> cover<00:01:08.040> on

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
enough so I decided to put a cover on

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.649 
enough so I decided to put a cover on
these<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.510> cheap<00:01:09.810> simple<00:01:10.229> solution<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
these and a very cheap simple solution I

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.340 
these and a very cheap simple solution I
found<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:14.299> find<00:01:15.299> yourself<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.869> suitable

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
found was to find yourself a suitable

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.090 
found was to find yourself a suitable

obviously a ham and a really lovely
little<00:02:01.619> circuit<00:02:02.479> I've<00:02:03.479> had<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.899> several

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
little circuit I've had it for several

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.600 
little circuit I've had it for several
years<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.799> been<00:02:04.829> beautifully<00:02:05.399> made<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
years now have been beautifully made I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.760 
years now have been beautifully made I
didn't<00:02:06.060> make<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.319> I'm<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> problem

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
didn't make it but I'm not a problem

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.740 
didn't make it but I'm not a problem
but<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:13.270> voltage<00:02:14.610> goes<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.820> about<00:02:16.000> 30<00:02:16.390> volts<00:02:16.630> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
but the voltage goes to about 30 volts I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.350 
but the voltage goes to about 30 volts I
believe<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.830> it's<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.340> little<00:02:18.940> meter

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
believe and it's on this little meter

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.120 
believe and it's on this little meter
here<00:02:19.540> which<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.550> very<00:02:21.550> handy<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:22.480> getting

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
here which is not very handy for getting

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.930 
here which is not very handy for getting
exact<00:02:24.130> measurements

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
exact measurements

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.990 
exact measurements
so<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.630> usually<00:02:25.870> couple<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:27.390> another<00:02:28.390> meter

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so I usually couple up up another meter

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.030 
so I usually couple up up another meter
so<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.270> see<00:02:31.510> exactly<00:02:32.110> what<00:02:32.380> I've<00:02:32.530> got<00:02:32.800> so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
so I can see exactly what I've got so

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.700 
so I can see exactly what I've got so
you<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.460> there<00:02:33.700> we've<00:02:33.970> got<00:02:34.710> something

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
you can see there we've got something

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.590 
you can see there we've got something
like<00:02:35.890> 5<00:02:36.190> volts<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:36.970> one<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.300> hardly

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
like 5 volts and this one is hardly

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.910 
like 5 volts and this one is hardly
moved<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.710> accurate<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:41.470> really<00:02:41.770> want

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
moved it is accurate but we really want

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.180 
moved it is accurate but we really want
something<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> little<00:02:42.430> bit<00:02:42.550> better<00:02:42.760> than<00:02:43.090> that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
something a little bit better than that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.860 
something a little bit better than that
so<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.310> sent<00:02:45.520> off<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.760> one<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.240> these<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.630> pan

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so it sent off for one of these just pan
