00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
side and look at it this way I can also

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
side and look at it this way I can also
spin<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> around<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> back<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.690> at

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
spin it around from the back and look at

spin it around from the back and look at
the<00:00:46.110> bite<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.969> look<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the bite from the back I can look at the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.100 
the bite from the back I can look at the
upper<00:00:49.140> arch<00:00:49.350> independently<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.789> see

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
upper arch independently and you can see

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
upper arch independently and you can see
how<00:00:52.110> significant<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> crowding<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
how significant the crowding is in the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
how significant the crowding is in the
upper<00:00:54.090> arch<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.739> by<00:00:55.800> looking

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
upper arch I can do the same by looking

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
upper arch I can do the same by looking
at<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> lower<00:00:56.850> arch<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> flipping<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> down

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
at the lower arch and flipping that down

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
at the lower arch and flipping that down
these<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.070> how<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.640> teeth<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.120> initially

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
these are how your teeth look initially

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
these are how your teeth look initially
you'll<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> progression<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.949> treatment

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you'll see the progression of treatment

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.609 
you'll see the progression of treatment
as<00:01:02.609> well<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> end<00:01:03.690> result<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
as well as the end result and you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
as well as the end result and you can
see<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> teeth<00:01:05.220> aligning<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> bite<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
see the teeth aligning the bite is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
see the teeth aligning the bite is
starting<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> open<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.340> at

starting to open up if you just look at
the<00:01:08.610> front<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.439> pan<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the front then the end if I pan to the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789

there<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.890> variation<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.180> thing<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.630> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there is some variation the thing I can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
there is some variation the thing I can
tell<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> today<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.770> invisalign<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
tell you today about invisalign it is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
tell you today about invisalign it is
much<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.689> accurate<00:01:46.200> than<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.799> back

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
much more accurate than what it was back

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
much more accurate than what it was back
in<00:01:47.729> 2002<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.079> first<00:01:49.290> trained<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
in 2002 when I was first trained on it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.520 
in 2002 when I was first trained on it
typically<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.880> an<00:01:51.030> Invisalign<00:01:51.600> case<00:01:52.049> there

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
typically in an Invisalign case there

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.100 
typically in an Invisalign case there
are<00:01:52.740> attachments<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> teeth<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
are attachments that go on the teeth and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.230 
are attachments that go on the teeth and
what<00:01:55.290> attachments<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.159> our<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.850> tooth

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
what attachments are our little tooth

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990 
what attachments are our little tooth
colored<00:01:57.719> composite<00:01:58.530> buttons<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.549> call<00:01:59.820> them

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
colored composite buttons I call them

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
colored composite buttons I call them
our<00:02:00.149> bumps<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.110> put<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> teeth<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
our bumps that we put on the teeth and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.999 
our bumps that we put on the teeth and
those<00:02:02.939> bumps<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.570> determined<00:02:04.140> by<00:02:04.290> movements

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
those bumps are determined by movements

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
those bumps are determined by movements
that<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.369> need<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.640> place<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.240> teeth

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that we need to place in those teeth

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660 
that we need to place in those teeth
when<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> treatment<00:02:07.560> plan<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.369> all

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
when we do the treatment plan not all

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.990 
when we do the treatment plan not all
teeth<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
teeth get them but

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.730 
teeth get them but
one<00:02:10.630> thing<00:02:10.840> that's<00:02:11.080> interesting<00:02:11.290> about

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
one thing that's interesting about

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.400 
one thing that's interesting about
Invisalign<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.090> works<00:02:13.330> by<00:02:13.570> pushing<00:02:13.930> teeth

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
Invisalign is it works by pushing teeth

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.800 
Invisalign is it works by pushing teeth
so<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:14.920> can't<00:02:15.160> really<00:02:15.280> pull<00:02:15.730> teeth<00:02:16.060> or<00:02:16.450> move

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so we can't really pull teeth or move

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.990 
so we can't really pull teeth or move
teeth<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.500> any<00:02:17.710> other<00:02:17.920> dimension<00:02:18.550> other<00:02:18.730> than

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
teeth and any other dimension other than

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.570 
teeth and any other dimension other than
by<00:02:19.180> pushing<00:02:19.540> them<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.260> these<00:02:20.580> attachments

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
by pushing them so these attachments

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.370 
by pushing them so these attachments
that<00:02:21.640> go<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.180> teeth<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.720> flat<00:02:23.020> plains

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
that go on the teeth have flat plains

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.410 
that go on the teeth have flat plains
and<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.860> aligners<00:02:24.430> push<00:02:24.790> against<00:02:25.180> those

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
and the aligners push against those

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.350 
and the aligners push against those
planes<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.260> cause<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.520> movements<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.090> we

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
planes and cause the movements that we

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.330 
planes and cause the movements that we
need<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.750> those<00:02:28.930> teeth<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.470> rarely<00:02:29.920> do

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
need in those teeth I rarely do

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.850 
need in those teeth I rarely do
attachments<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.210> first<00:02:31.540> aligner<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.260> will

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
attachments on the first aligner I will

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.150 
attachments on the first aligner I will
often<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.430> them<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:34.060> liner<00:02:34.390> number<00:02:34.810> four

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
often do them on a liner number four

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.770 
often do them on a liner number four
initially<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> want<00:02:36.550> patients<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.150> get<00:02:37.300> used<00:02:37.570> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
initially I want patients to get used to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.810 
initially I want patients to get used to
wearing<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.320> liners<00:02:38.800> taking<00:02:39.250> them<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
wearing the liners taking them in and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820 
wearing the liners taking them in and
out<00:02:39.970> get<00:02:40.540> used<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.080> comfort<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
out get used to the comfort of the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.860 
out get used to the comfort of the
aligner<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.970> dealing<00:02:43.240> with<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:43.840> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
aligner and just dealing with it on a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.710 
aligner and just dealing with it on a
daily<00:02:44.260> basis<00:02:44.740> once<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.640> attachments<00:02:46.360> go<00:02:46.390> on

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
daily basis once the attachments go on

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.260 
daily basis once the attachments go on
on<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.200> liner<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.770> often<00:02:48.730> times<00:02:49.000> they're<00:02:49.240> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
on the liner for often times they're a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.150 
on the liner for often times they're a
little<00:02:49.480> harder<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.050> take<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.680> off<00:02:50.770> and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
little harder to take on and off and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.550 
little harder to take on and off and
they<00:02:51.459> fit<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> little<00:02:52.090> bit<00:02:52.330> snugger<00:02:52.660> teeth<00:02:53.200> tend

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
they fit a little bit snugger teeth tend

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.350 
they fit a little bit snugger teeth tend
to<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.280> sore<00:02:54.610> at<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.060> time

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
to be a little more sore at that time

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.910 
to be a little more sore at that time
because<00:02:55.780> teeth<00:02:55.990> are<00:02:56.110> moving<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.650> little<00:02:56.800> bit

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
because teeth are moving a little bit

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.460 
because teeth are moving a little bit
more<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.330> just<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.870> little<00:02:59.080> more<00:02:59.350> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
more and you know just a little more to

more and you know just a little more to
get<00:02:59.590> used<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> don't<00:03:00.490> want<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.880> overwhelm

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
get used to so I don't want to overwhelm

anybody at the beginning I tell all of
our<00:03:03.880> patients<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.630> many<00:03:05.140> cases<00:03:05.740> have<00:03:06.010> to

refinement is where we kind of detail

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.199 
refinement is where we kind of detail
and<00:03:11.050> finish<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.560> case<00:03:11.770> at<00:03:12.250> refinements<00:03:13.090> we

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and finish the case at refinements we

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.880 
and finish the case at refinements we
will<00:03:13.390> take<00:03:13.570> all<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.959> little<00:03:14.230> bumps<00:03:14.560> off<00:03:14.709> the

will take all the little bumps off the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
send it back into Invisalign and tell

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.009 
send it back into Invisalign and tell
them<00:03:21.040> exactly<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:22.090> want<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.450> detail<00:03:22.840> and

them exactly what we want to detail and
