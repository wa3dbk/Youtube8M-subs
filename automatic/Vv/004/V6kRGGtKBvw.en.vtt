00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 At first glance it seems easy to arm the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.429
 Six sides of different colors of the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 Rubik cube but in reality it is not 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.950
 for luís gómez it is very simple in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 just one minute 40 seconds he arms 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.769
 my father taught me to do wrong in and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
 after a month of starting mari with 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 potatoes we know the effects of time in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.989
 that less arms and Asia can be weapons 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.239
 and I can teach my classmates 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.640
 how to be melco at 10 years discovered 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.350
 this skill that had it hidden from 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 little by little he was learning the most 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.320
 Easy to place the pieces on the site 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 appropriate first touch by making a cross 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.969
 then touches put the points for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 form a face after touch they are 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.850
 the faces too many touches you touches ponele 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.089
 make two colors you have to make a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 cross with him with the face that is up 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.929
 and then he gets and he put the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.120
 sides and it goes down to put all 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.710
 whites and give him his position that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 would be several of his companions 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 they try to imitate him but they can not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 among all 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.170
 the volunteers failed to put together a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.360
 only side as it is commonly said two 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.940
 heads think better than one but in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 this case one head was better than seven 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.800
 I think it's excellent that you can 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.620
 do that since there is also develops 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.930
 the brain and the mental capacity of him 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.840
 it seems very good to me because it is very fast 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
 are movements are accurate even to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 the masters has surprised with agility 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 and dexterity that moves his hands to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.550
 time to put the puzzle together 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 three-dimensional but from there the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.570
 teachers we have not even been 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.270
 joke this cube is already years old and some 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.800
 we try again more 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.160
 we destroy more we thwart more than 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.140
 achieve rebuild your state 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.300
 natural every day he tries to break his 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 own record and even accept challenges 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.590
 that very few would dare to do it and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.530
 you really see that for the rest of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 little companions it is very difficult 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.710
 arm as he had manifested so 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.660
 less one side because watching the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.310
 skill that I had told him to see we're going 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.050
 doing a rest 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 and I accept, I want you to do it 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.370
 closed my eyes and I did the cube 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.250
 Rubik is a mechanical puzzle 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.700
 invented by the Hungarian sculptor ernö 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.430
 rubik in 1974 so far they have 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 sold 350 million cubes throughout the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.190
 world this game does not go out of style 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.220
 world compete the fastest if 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.530
 I would like to participate in a contest already 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.440
 that's a skill that few 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 people own and like once my 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.670
 licensed osvaldo lara made me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.530
 participate most people are 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.170
 was surprised since nobody has 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.540
 done here in this institution since 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.230
 imbabura myth marcelo méndez this was 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.230
 surprising
