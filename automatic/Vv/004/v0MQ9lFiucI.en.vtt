00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.470 
modern because teens nowadays they're so
modern<00:02:39.650> they're<00:02:40.650> starting<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.269> think<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
modern they're starting to think the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.710 
modern they're starting to think the
traditional<00:02:43.049> way<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.380> boring<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.569> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
traditional way is boring so what if I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.589 
traditional way is boring so what if I
mixed<00:02:46.230> them<00:02:46.640> they'd<00:02:47.640> still<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.150> into<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
mixed them they'd still be into the

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.569 
mixed them they'd still be into the
modern<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.170> they<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.980> learn<00:02:50.160> more<00:02:50.430> about

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
modern but they would learn more about

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.979 
modern but they would learn more about
the<00:02:50.910> traditional<00:02:51.510> too

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the traditional too

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.259 
the traditional too
I<00:02:52.310> think<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.599> making<00:02:54.599> an<00:02:55.049> impact

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
I think it's making an impact
