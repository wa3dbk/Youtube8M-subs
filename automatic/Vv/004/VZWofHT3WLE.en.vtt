00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
defense-oriented that looks like they're

well<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> play<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> definitely

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
well I think the play here is definitely

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
well I think the play here is definitely
Cleveland<00:02:09.060> plus<00:02:09.330> two<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:10.140> also<00:02:10.289> lean

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
Cleveland plus two I would also lean

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.450 
Cleveland plus two I would also lean
towards<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.459> under<00:02:11.910> 41<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.989> line

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
towards the the under 41 that in line

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.980 
towards the the under 41 that in line
so<00:02:13.520> might<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.910> been<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.210> especially<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:14.840> some

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
so might get been up especially if some

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.450 
so might get been up especially if some
of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> other<00:02:15.500> week<00:02:15.770> two<00:02:15.950> preseason<00:02:16.310> games

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
of the other week two preseason games

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.880 
of the other week two preseason games
start<00:02:16.880> going<00:02:17.120> over<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.200> might<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.650> better

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
start going over that I might get better

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.610 
start going over that I might get better
but<00:02:19.220> at<00:02:19.460> 41<00:02:20.150> I'd<00:02:20.510> still<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.110> under<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.560> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
but at 41 I'd still like the under and I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.650 
but at 41 I'd still like the under and I
think<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.950> lot<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.670> play<00:02:22.910> also<00:02:23.240> is

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
think a lot the the play also is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.390 
think a lot the the play also is
Cleveland<00:02:24.170> plus<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.770> do<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:24.980> agree<00:02:25.160> with<00:02:25.250> that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400
