00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 My mother forced me to dance the swing. 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.310
 When I had .... 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.100
 - Me too ! - Skye too. 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.990
 When can I be 14-15 years old, she enrolls me in classes 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.010
 And if I did not go 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 so I had to pay all my debts 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.290
 So I went there, and that's how I started 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 If I did not go, yes she threatened me 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:42.560
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.730
 My mother too ... 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.020
 My mother ... has nothing to do with that! 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 But I danced Boogie Woogie 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.020
 and I went to a dance camp called Herrang 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.780
 and I started dancing lindy hop 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.580
 Since then I have not stopped. 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.000
 By cons, I stopped the boogie woogie, but that's another story 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.970
 So I started on the tracks of Herrang. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:51.050
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.720
 Naomi and I started together. 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.200
 We knew each other before we danced 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.370
 We were best friends when we were small. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.470
 And we ... oh yes! 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.320
 It was excellent, I was a little girl and she was a little older and cool! 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.450
 It is true ! She could drive ... I still had my braces. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:25.790
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.780
 So ... The real reason why we started dancing 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.300
 It was because of cute guys! 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.270
 Very very cute ... 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.450
 They were twins ... both. 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 But we both liked the same 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.370
 This is another of our stories! 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.980
 We organized dances at our school. It was not swing 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.640
 Because we did not know anything about the swing ... 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.050
 There were musicians playing Rockabilly music 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.740
 They were very cute 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.520
 We were all well dressed 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 or at least we thought 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.940
 even though I think our vintage clothes were not so ugly. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.350
 We were crazy and the musicians asked us 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.070
 if we danced Lindy Hop. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.560
 We said, "What is Lindy Hop?" 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.690
 and they told us, "Oh, we're going to dance it next Saturday with other couples" 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.910
 And we said "ouiiiiiii" 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.270
 Then we went dancing, forgetting about the boys. 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:44.460
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.100
 I hate twin guys 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.820
 I played Basketball before Lindy 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.060
 Lindy Hop was very popular 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.230
 The swing dance was very popular in my city 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.560
 I never really started because it's in my culture 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.910
 The girls in the gym asked me to dance with them 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.210
 I had several friends who did not want 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.910
 dance. So it was between them and me 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.220
 We had really fun! 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.630
 ... 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:51.340
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.370
 A friend, Gordon invited me to come to dance 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.180
 ... 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.160
 And at the end of the night, a girl came and asked me for a dance 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.460
 She was rather cute. So I asked him to show me what to do 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.960
 And she showed me something like that ... 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.820
 That was what I was like 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.900
 And I looked at my friend Gordon 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.050
 He was dancing with this 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.070
 with this ... "older girl" 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.600
 I say "older" but you will understand 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.180
 just after 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.380
 And he was doing all that stuff, full kicks everywhere 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.490
 I was looking at him and I thought, "Hmm, I want to do that!" 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.340
 A year later, I knew that this "older girl" was Skye's mother! 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.650
 So we can say that Skye's mother encouraged me to dance 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.030
 I would like... 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.770
 Oops, sorry ... 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:22.850
 - Translation into Korean - 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.210
 I skated. 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.950
 Yes, I really loved it, I had dreams 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.960
 golden levels and lots of other stuff 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.570
 But my body hurt, my knees ... 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.470
 And my parents started dancing the swing. 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.520
 And my parents knew ... Skye's mother! 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.750
 I knew Skye's mother and Skye looked nice 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.440
 ... 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.410
 Yes, we were small. 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.900
 Steven Mitchel taught Hip Hop. 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.930
 So we came to Hip Hop class on Friday 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.940
 Steven was also teaching Swing on Saturday morning and I went 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.410
 because Skye encouraged me. 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.580
 So I went there. And I had a wee bit scared 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.600
 with all these old dancers, bigger. 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.170
 But I overcame that. 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.090
 And I can still overcome that. 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:08:01.200
