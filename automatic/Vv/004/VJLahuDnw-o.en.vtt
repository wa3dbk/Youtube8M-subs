deluxe Stratocaster and it has some kind
of<00:00:40.770> modern<00:00:41.040> appointments<00:00:41.750> as<00:00:42.750> opposed<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of modern appointments as opposed to the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.760 
of modern appointments as opposed to the
little<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.530> finish<00:00:44.420> specs<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.680> out

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
little more finish specs so we start out

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
little more finish specs so we start out
I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.129> booth<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> probably<00:00:48.239> probably

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I think booth this is probably probably

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.299 
I think booth this is probably probably
either<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.200> ash<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.649> alder<00:00:49.920> body<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.250> not

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.179 
would prefer to be a little bit bigger
that's<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.200> preference<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.770> big<00:02:05.009> but

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that's just my preference I like big but

as<00:02:06.310> far<00:02:06.579> as<00:02:06.609> frets<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.299> believe<00:02:07.600> they're<00:02:07.960> medium

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
as far as frets I believe they're medium

as far as frets I believe they're medium
jumbo<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.750> think<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.050> radius<00:02:11.379> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
jumbo and I think the radius is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.729 
jumbo and I think the radius is
definitely<00:02:12.099> more<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> 12<00:02:12.879> inch<00:02:13.150> radius<00:02:13.900> 10

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
definitely more like a 12 inch radius 10

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.400 
definitely more like a 12 inch radius 10
or<00:02:14.890> 12<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:16.090> really<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.660> sort<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.050> seven

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
or 12 it's really not the sort of seven

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.820 
or 12 it's really not the sort of seven
where<00:02:18.129> ever<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.480> super<00:02:19.480> vintage<00:02:19.810> radius<00:02:20.500> that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.470
