Deere<00:00:17.010> snow<00:00:17.369> blower<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:20.130> got

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
Deere snow blower that I actually got

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
Deere snow blower that I actually got
from<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:21.060> dad<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:24.180> originally

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
from my dad and it originally

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.339 
from my dad and it originally
I'm<00:00:25.920> guessing<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.840> particular<00:00:27.840> snow<00:00:28.050> blower

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I'm guessing this particular snow blower

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.150 
I'm guessing this particular snow blower
is<00:00:28.789> from<00:00:29.789> somewhere<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> 70s<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.950> my<00:00:34.950> dad

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is from somewhere in the 70s and my dad

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
is from somewhere in the 70s and my dad
gave<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.910> me<00:00:36.260> because<00:00:37.260> he<00:00:37.440> didn't<00:00:37.680> really

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
gave this to me because he didn't really

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
gave this to me because he didn't really
want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> spend<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.879> fix<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
want to spend time to fix the thing and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.540 
want to spend time to fix the thing and
he's<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> snow<00:00:40.739> blower<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> front<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
he's got a snow blower on the front of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
he's got a snow blower on the front of
his<00:00:41.670> lawn<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.540> anyway

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
his lawn more anyway

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.779 
his lawn more anyway
I<00:00:43.460> saw<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> took<00:00:44.850> some<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.239> he<00:00:45.690> originally<00:00:46.230> had

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
I saw I took some time he originally had

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
I saw I took some time he originally had
this<00:00:47.789> 7<00:00:48.270> horsepower<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:49.289> comes<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> engine

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this 7 horsepower to comes the engine

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
this 7 horsepower to comes the engine
which<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.579> believe<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.600> still<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> good

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
which I believe actually is still a good

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
which I believe actually is still a good
engine<00:00:52.500> yet<00:00:52.739> yeah<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.760> old<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
engine yet yeah it's just old so I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250

and everything belts mounted right up
with<00:01:36.600> no<00:01:36.750> problem<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.470> there<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.740> little

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
with no problem so there was very little

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.050 
with no problem so there was very little
modification<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.180> had<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> thing

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
modification I had to make to the thing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
modification I had to make to the thing
and<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.020> running<00:01:43.320> engine

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and this is a good little running engine

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
and this is a good little running engine
it<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.460> seen<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.610> snow<00:01:47.820> blower

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it actually has seen this snow blower

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.200 
it actually has seen this snow blower
seems<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.540> more<00:01:48.720> power<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:50.030> than<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> did

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
seems to have more power now than it did

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.050 
seems to have more power now than it did
when<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.619> head<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> comes<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:56.729> starts

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
when the head that comes on it starts

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560 
when the head that comes on it starts
right<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.659> no<00:01:57.810> problems

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.050 

overall<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.990> didn't<00:02:03.259> want<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.439> scrap<00:02:03.799> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
overall I just didn't want to scrap the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.240 
overall I just didn't want to scrap the
snowblower<00:02:05.060> because<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.780> was<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.039> and

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
snowblower because it was in it is and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820 
snowblower because it was in it is and
otherwise<00:02:07.610> excellent<00:02:08.209> shape

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
otherwise excellent shape

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.790 
otherwise excellent shape
none<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.459> comes<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.680> think<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
none that comes the I think the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.199 
none that comes the I think the
carburetor<00:02:13.069> needs<00:02:13.519> cleaned<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:13.970> real<00:02:14.180> good

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
carburetor needs cleaned up real good

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.390 
carburetor needs cleaned up real good
whatever<00:02:15.050> but<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.959> felt<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.400> something

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
whatever but I just felt that something

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.339 
whatever but I just felt that something
new<00:02:19.550> might<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> little<00:02:20.300> better<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.110> only

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
new might be a little better the only

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.259 
new might be a little better the only
modification<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.130> had<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.370> make<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:23.000> here

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
modification I had to make is right here

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.650 
modification I had to make is right here
actually<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.430> handle<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> turret

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
actually with this handle or the turret

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.140 
actually with this handle or the turret
as<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:26.959> people<00:02:27.110> call<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.970> like

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
as some people call it and just like

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.180 
as some people call it and just like
lots<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.569> other<00:02:29.690> videos<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.709> I've<00:02:30.860> seen

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
lots of other videos that I've seen

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.479 
lots of other videos that I've seen
where<00:02:32.000> they<00:02:32.180> made<00:02:32.890> change<00:02:33.890> put<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> different

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
where they made change put a different

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.420 
where they made change put a different
engine<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.910> these<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.080> make<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.190> little

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
engine on these and make this little

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.759 
engine on these and make this little
bracket<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:38.510> pull<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.140> out<00:02:39.349> because

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
bracket to pull this out because

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.680 
bracket to pull this out because
otherwise<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.400> hits<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.790> engine<00:02:41.090> mount<00:02:41.540> under

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
otherwise it hits the engine mount under

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.050 
otherwise it hits the engine mount under
where<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.870> was<00:02:42.110> originally<00:02:45.250> bill<00:02:46.250> works<00:02:46.489> right

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
where it was originally bill works right

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.740 
where it was originally bill works right
here<00:02:47.739> no<00:02:48.739> problems<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:53.000> only<00:02:53.299> thing<00:02:53.630> I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
haven't got quite accomplished yet and I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.750 
haven't got quite accomplished yet and I
don't<00:02:55.880> know<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.239> will<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.170> haven't<00:02:57.760> quite

figured out just how I want to or if I
can<00:03:02.480> hook<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.840> throttle<00:03:03.200> cable<00:03:03.349> up<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
can hook the throttle cable up the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.830 
can hook the throttle cable up the
original<00:03:04.610> throttle<00:03:05.150> cable<00:03:05.480> up<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.630> this

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
original throttle cable up to this

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380 
original throttle cable up to this
engine<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.590> make<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.430> work<00:03:07.579> right<00:03:07.819> or<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.090> but

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
engine and make it work right or not but

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.270 
engine and make it work right or not but
otherwise<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.319> no<00:03:09.350> problem<00:03:09.859> if<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:09.980> see

otherwise I have no problem if you see

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.580 
otherwise I have no problem if you see

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
the throttle that's on the engine it's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.949 
the throttle that's on the engine it's
not<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.950> big<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> deal

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
with it something I can actually use now

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.070 
with it something I can actually use now
and<00:05:29.639> for<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.060> hundred<00:05:30.300> bucks<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.659> couldn't<00:05:30.900> beat

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
and for a hundred bucks I couldn't beat

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.700 
and for a hundred bucks I couldn't beat
that<00:05:31.620> price<00:05:31.830> on<00:05:32.159> this<00:05:32.310> particular<00:05:32.879> engine

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
that price on this particular engine

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.460 
that price on this particular engine
again<00:05:34.710> that's<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.270> predator<00:05:36.270> which<00:05:37.020> the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
again that's the predator which the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.860 
again that's the predator which the
guests<00:05:37.949> from<00:05:38.099> what<00:05:38.280> I've<00:05:38.400> read<00:05:38.669> is<00:05:39.000> basically

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
guests from what I've read is basically

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.999 
guests from what I've read is basically
a<00:05:40.020> clone<00:05:40.440> of<00:05:40.470> a<00:05:40.710> Honda

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.379

so far I have no complaints over this

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.890 
so far I have no complaints over this
engine<00:05:45.840> it's<00:05:46.340> it's<00:05:47.340> an<00:05:47.430> overhead<00:05:47.789> valve<00:05:48.030> works

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
engine it's it's an overhead valve works

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.550 
engine it's it's an overhead valve works
pretty<00:05:49.169> good<00:05:49.789> so<00:05:50.789> just<00:05:51.719> a<00:05:53.870> fun<00:05:54.870> little<00:05:54.900> project

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
pretty good so just a fun little project

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.420 
pretty good so just a fun little project
to<00:05:55.620> do<00:05:56.039> and<00:05:56.340> get<00:05:56.490> switched<00:05:56.729> over<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:58.430> again

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
to do and get switched over so again

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.170 
to do and get switched over so again
this<00:05:59.580> was<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.169> John<00:06:01.169> Deere<00:06:01.379> Model<00:06:01.849> 726<00:06:03.979> and

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
this was the John Deere Model 726 and

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.300 
this was the John Deere Model 726 and
and<00:06:06.180> I'm<00:06:06.419> guessing<00:06:06.900> as<00:06:07.289> I<00:06:07.469> said<00:06:07.680> it's<00:06:08.039> from

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
and I'm guessing as I said it's from

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.809 
and I'm guessing as I said it's from
probably<00:06:09.090> somewhere<00:06:09.930> in<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.650> 70s<00:06:11.219> there<00:06:11.370> and

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
probably somewhere in the 70s there and

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.200 
probably somewhere in the 70s there and
it<00:06:12.719> is<00:06:12.900> solid<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:14.310> just<00:06:14.729> wanted<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.029> share

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
it is solid but just wanted to share

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.430 
it is solid but just wanted to share
this<00:06:15.389> with<00:06:15.599> you<00:06:15.919> thanks<00:06:16.919> for<00:06:17.069> watching
