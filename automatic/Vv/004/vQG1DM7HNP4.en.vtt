00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
979 so our first test is going to be the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440 
979 so our first test is going to be the
swatch<00:00:42.750> test<00:00:43.290> where<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
eyeliners on my arm to compare and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
contrast them and she's going to guess

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.580

which one is the Stila I thought this is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
which one is the Stila I thought this is
gonna<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.829> hard<00:00:53.039> cuz<00:00:53.399> they're<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.090> black<00:00:54.449> all

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
gonna be hard cuz they're all black all

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:08.090

have<00:07:09.240> to<00:07:09.270> apply<00:07:09.570> a<00:07:09.690> little<00:07:10.200> bit<00:07:10.350> more<00:07:10.710> pressure

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
have to apply a little bit more pressure

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
and some more layers to make it darker

and some more layers to make it darker
and<00:07:14.370> make<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:14.670> show<00:07:14.940> up<00:07:15.150> and<00:07:15.480> they<00:07:16.050> both<00:07:16.230> dry

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530
