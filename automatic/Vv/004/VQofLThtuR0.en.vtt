00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
to make this one only five seconds long

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.700 
to make this one only five seconds long
just<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.359> full<00:00:21.359> HD<00:00:21.720> 24<00:00:22.260> frames<00:00:22.529> a

create<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> new<00:00:25.980> text<00:00:26.250> layer<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:27.090> i'm

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
create a new text layer and then i'm

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.099 
create a new text layer and then i'm
going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> type<00:00:27.830> shiny<00:00:29.359> text<00:00:30.359> let<00:00:30.869> me<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
going to type shiny text let me just

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.830 
going to type shiny text let me just
move<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.650> position<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.630> i'm<00:00:33.719> going

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.209 
move it into position and then i'm going
to<00:00:33.899> duplicate<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.469> layer<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.980> i'm<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219

I'm<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> boost<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.649> curves

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I'm just going to boost my curves

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
I'm just going to boost my curves
adjustment<00:00:53.280> something<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> then
