00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 Hello dear friends are you on the channel 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.850
 with and g on monday as usual with us 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.550
 there is a video about the series schedule on 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.740
 the upcoming week and this week us 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.650
 two major releases are expected of course 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 This is gta 5 on the soldering platform . 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 By computers I think many are waiting and I 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.929
 pre-order including will play with 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 friends but the channel is unlikely to appear 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 because the computer will not allow 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 record most likely also mortal 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
 kombat x mkx 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.480
 10 as who calls in general the same here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.040
 two options if i can write 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 then the channel will either 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.329
 and a glance or stream can be 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.420
 maybe even be this somehow 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 I will issue but in the general environment among 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 until Wednesday specified on schedule 12 Moscow 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 this is the approximate time do not forget here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 may be right a day well a day after 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.809
 release so let's say will be on the channel i 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 I hope at least to write 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.140
 mortal kombat 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 Oh, I always loved fighting games except 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.290
 addition all other projects on schedule 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.909
 watch the day and time carefully 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.009
 Moscow indicated approximate may be 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 there is an hour earlier two later 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 follow the VKontakte group for 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.520
 news may even cancel something 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 This you must understand that if you're on 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.799
 plan a week in advance then plans 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.380
 sometimes life changes all the same 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.450
 as usual and not always everything you can 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.600
 calculate in advance 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.509
 Well, Friday is expected 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.329
 long-long pancakes long stream straight 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.729
 Live on the game, that is, I will play 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.280
 during this live resident evil 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.509
 hd remaster first part of reissue 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.350
 which came out a long time ago 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.500
 quite a while 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.540
 a couple of months ago I wanted to channel everything 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 then write down, then trim well 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.149
 before the turn came to this game this one 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.579
 of my favorite series therefore definitely 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.640
 I will try for one stream game to go 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.330
 just because I was already playing and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.480
 a lot of things there 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.460
 I hope that for a long time it will not take 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
 so that for the stream I will manage it 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.930
 long naturally start somewhere with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.210

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.590
 Moscow and so be prepared who 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.420
 can see who can 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.700
 I hope for your audience 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.030
 attention and activity 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.340
