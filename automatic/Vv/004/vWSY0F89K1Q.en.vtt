100 g (1 cup) Parmesan cheese, grated

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.400
A handful of fresh basil, chopped

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
Directions

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Sieve the flour and salt together into a large bowl and make a well in the centre.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.500
In a glass, dissolve the yeast and honey in the water, wait a few minutes until it becomes foamy

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 then add Serjella olive oil and pour the mixture into the well.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Bring together with your fingers until it forms a ball and start kneading the dough until smooth.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
Brush the dough with olive oil, put it back into the bowl

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.300
cover it with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 1 hour at room temperature.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.900
Place the dough over parchment paper and roll it out into a circle or rectangle of 2.5 cm thick. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.800
Cover with a kitchen cloth and let it rise again for 1 hour.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.500
With your fingers press all over to make little wells that will retain the flavourings.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.800
In a small bowl mix the butter and garlic then brush the dough with it.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:15.000
sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and basil on top and bake for 20 min a preheated oven at 200°C.
