00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.740
 negotiated agreement 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.359
 also the very first performance 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.359
 I also want to be present and sound 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.220

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 the fact that I picked up practical sparta 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.240
 this case 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.780
 Obviously that's just a woman from 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 also supports 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.230
 we will 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.230
 but that has already reached a whole row 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.790
 the building trade 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 for that call 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 view the entire vs 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.460

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.830
 the case came to say it happened 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.830
 that goes wrong 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.840

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.349

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.919
 to a caveman 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.379

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.079
 of the relevant article 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.079
 this is not only mandatory 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.809

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.399
 debut 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.259

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.259
 the euro was there today 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.639

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.919
 the choice between the two 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.990

 it is also supposed to look a bit like a shipbuilder 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:08.740
 nowadays anyway 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.710
