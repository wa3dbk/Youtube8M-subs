 downloaded the files we are going to 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.680
 move to the phone sd memory and if 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.080
 they do not have so they can pass to a 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.130
 internal there is no problem then 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.799
 it has to be compatible 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.680
 your terminal with tell your recovery has 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.039
 advanced to be able to install from the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.780

 we're going to move on to what is our 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.849
 forgiveness device is here 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.849

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.960
 to be here I tried them I said to myself 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 download those but they did not work for me and 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.550
 if it does not work for you here I leave you 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.830
 these 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 those gaps that did not work that is the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.670
 of 'hip-hop' 12 12 and the rumba then 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.370
 once passed we went to the phone 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.590
 when he arrived we saw then we go to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
 put our samsung galaxy s phone 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.569
 4 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.450
 since it's off we 're going to press and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.540
 let's go to what is the recovery menu 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 that would be deferring home volume up 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.340
 what is the power key the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.340
 crush for about three seconds 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.000
 and we let go until we do not do the legend 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.080
 who is turning to this one is alone 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.080
 we're going to wait 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.980
 there already sent me to the recovery then in 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.319
 this case I use the release version 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.560
 touch 6.20 point 7 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.270
 then we go to white datafactory 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.020
 forgiveness forgiveness white datafactory 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.010
 and clinton insight black 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.010
 he's waiting for us 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 to do the formatting of the following 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.830
 folders that would be the attacker 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.130
 format the system and the tin this does not 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.130
 delete user data 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.359
 then let's wait 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.280
 and there we have a key to 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.180
 continue and then we will urge city 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.480
 from earth seeker vista and 7 in this case 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.070
 we give him here and here he gives us a series of 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.150
 options then we're going to joyce 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.620
 choice 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.170
 if they are that sector 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.380
 it would be that up 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.249
 let's find the rom and here it is good 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.129
 fact 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:39.709

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:44.679
 I see it here very well 01 11 sorry 

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:44.679
 then we will install it to room 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.459
 let's wait for him to install 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.660
 this may take around 5 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.930
 minutes 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.050
 as you can see fast in the room and there 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.350
 it gives us that he already did the installation and 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.360
 the strip then we're going to go another one 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:25.000

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.810
 as you can see here they are and we give you 10 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.520
 then you are going to install the apps of 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.100
 google to have the applications of 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.660
 Google 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.660

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.180
 and there it is then we are going to leave 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.669
 Here again 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.669
 in choice reboots and step out 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.500
 and we would have installed the rumba 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.750
