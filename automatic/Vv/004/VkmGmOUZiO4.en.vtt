00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
out and bright sunlight this BAC takes

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.889 
out and bright sunlight this BAC takes
over<00:01:33.469> it's<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.649> fiberoptic<00:01:34.810> increases<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
over it's a fiberoptic increases the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.719 
over it's a fiberoptic increases the
brightness<00:01:36.079> on<00:01:36.530> your<00:01:36.679> reticle<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:37.459> in<00:01:37.579> any

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
brightness on your reticle so in any

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
lighting this reticle works the reticles

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.910 
lighting this reticle works the reticles
black<00:01:40.279> all<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.549> time<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.539> so<00:01:42.439> you've<00:01:42.590> got<00:01:42.770> that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
if you don't need any increase like they

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.010 
if you don't need any increase like they
just<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.990> center<00:01:45.289> lights<00:01:45.529> up<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:46.399> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just the center lights up with the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.099 
just the center lights up with the
tritium<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.649> BAC<00:01:49.659> another<00:01:50.659> thing<00:01:50.899> this

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
tritium and the BAC another thing this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.260 
tritium and the BAC another thing this
has<00:01:51.289> got<00:01:51.469> for<00:01:52.009> close<00:01:52.219> range<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.850> there's<00:01:53.090> no

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
has got for close range and there's no

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.739 
has got for close range and there's no
magnification<00:01:54.109> on<00:01:54.469> this<00:01:54.679> RMR<00:01:55.310> or<00:01:55.939> MREs<00:01:56.539> oh

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
magnification on this RMR or MREs oh

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.169 
magnification on this RMR or MREs oh
it's<00:01:57.590> lit<00:01:57.889> up<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.219> gives<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.549> a<00:01:58.579> dot<00:01:58.819> right<00:01:59.029> in

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's lit up it gives you a dot right in

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.029 
it's lit up it gives you a dot right in
the<00:01:59.240> middle<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.539> close<00:01:59.869> ranked<00:02:00.170> targets<00:02:00.619> you
