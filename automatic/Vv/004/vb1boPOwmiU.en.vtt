00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.359 
them or soaking them in your water you
want<00:01:34.179> to<00:01:34.270> keep<00:01:34.479> them<00:01:34.630> inside<00:01:34.810> out<00:01:35.279> till<00:01:36.279> they

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
want to keep them inside out till they

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.659 
want to keep them inside out till they
dry<00:01:36.639> and<00:01:37.139> then<00:01:38.139> turn<00:01:38.740> them<00:01:38.829> right<00:01:38.979> side<00:01:39.039> again

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:39.669 
dry and then turn them right side again

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:43.019 
dry and then turn them right side again
so<00:01:39.969> that<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.619> outside<00:01:41.799> dries<00:01:42.340> off<00:01:42.609> then<00:01:42.909> you

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
so that the outside dries off then you

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.489 
so that the outside dries off then you
can<00:01:43.149> store<00:01:43.450> them<00:01:43.569> away<00:01:43.779> in<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:44.020> cool<00:01:44.229> dry<00:01:44.409> place

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
can store them away in a cool dry place

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.659 
can store them away in a cool dry place
until<00:01:45.249> your<00:01:45.369> next<00:01:45.579> dive<00:01:47.069> last<00:01:48.069> but<00:01:48.310> not<00:01:48.429> least

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:48.669 
until your next dive last but not least

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.789 
until your next dive last but not least
is<00:01:48.819> your<00:01:48.939> BCD<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:49.810> definitely<00:01:50.380> want<00:01:50.529> to<00:01:50.619> soak

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
is your BCD you definitely want to soak

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.529 
is your BCD you definitely want to soak
this<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.009> fresh<00:01:51.429> water<00:01:51.669> as<00:01:51.909> long<00:01:52.090> as<00:01:52.209> you<00:01:52.299> can

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
this in fresh water as long as you can

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.629 
this in fresh water as long as you can
even<00:01:52.989> warm<00:01:53.259> water<00:01:53.499> that<00:01:54.009> helps<00:01:54.279> break<00:01:54.579> down

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
even warm water that helps break down

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.370 
even warm water that helps break down
the<00:01:54.999> salt<00:01:55.209> residue<00:01:55.389> that<00:01:55.749> builds<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:56.139> on<00:01:56.319> the

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
the salt residue that builds up on the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.979 
the salt residue that builds up on the
fabric<00:01:56.709> or<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.249> exterior<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.669> the<00:01:57.759> BCD<00:01:58.090> you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
fabric or the exterior of the BCD you

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:00.690 
fabric or the exterior of the BCD you
also<00:01:59.169> wanna<00:01:59.499> make<00:01:59.559> it<00:01:59.739> a<00:01:59.770> point<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.069> add<00:02:00.340> water

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
also wanna make it a point to add water

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.149 
also wanna make it a point to add water
through<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.179> manual<00:02:01.509> inflator<00:02:01.779> hose<00:02:02.159> inflate

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
through the manual inflator hose inflate

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.330 
through the manual inflator hose inflate
it<00:02:03.309> up<00:02:03.539> swish<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.840> water<00:02:05.020> around<00:02:05.340> that's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
it up swish the water around that's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.430 
it up swish the water around that's
going<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.639> dilute<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.479> saltwater<00:02:07.959> that's<00:02:08.229> in

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
going to dilute the saltwater that's in

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.449 
going to dilute the saltwater that's in
there<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.459> want<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.819> turn<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.090> up

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
there then you want to just turn it up

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.280 
there then you want to just turn it up
yeah<00:02:10.609> maybe<00:02:11.329> with<00:02:11.569> your<00:02:11.689> powerful<00:02:12.019> inter

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
yeah maybe with your powerful inter

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.869 
yeah maybe with your powerful inter
attached<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:12.920> your<00:02:13.040> power<00:02:13.280> center<00:02:13.519> button

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
attached it's your power center button

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.800 
attached it's your power center button
the<00:02:14.629> air<00:02:14.840> will<00:02:15.730> expand<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> BCD<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.510> air

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
the air will expand the BCD and the air

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.530 
the air will expand the BCD and the air
pressure<00:02:17.959> will<00:02:18.260> force<00:02:18.590> your<00:02:19.180> water<00:02:20.180> out

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
pressure will force your water out

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.119 
pressure will force your water out
through<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.989> overpressure<00:02:21.379> relief<00:02:21.560> valves

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
through the overpressure relief valves

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.000 
through the overpressure relief valves
therefore<00:02:22.489> cleaning<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.299> well<00:02:24.010> and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
therefore cleaning that out as well and

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.979 
therefore cleaning that out as well and
then<00:02:25.219> soak<00:02:25.549> your<00:02:25.700> power<00:02:25.969> theta<00:02:26.209> 2<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.840> one

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
then soak your power theta 2 this is one

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.330 
then soak your power theta 2 this is one
of<00:02:27.079> the<00:02:27.139> most<00:02:27.349> neglected<00:02:27.560> pieces<00:02:28.189> of

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
of the most neglected pieces of

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.770 
of the most neglected pieces of
equipment<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:28.939> your<00:02:29.659> diving<00:02:30.260> kit<00:02:30.909> so<00:02:31.909> once

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.330 
equipment in your diving kit so once
you've<00:02:32.959> got<00:02:33.170> everything<00:02:33.500> set<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.709> again<00:02:34.099> like

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you've got everything set up again like

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.429 
you've got everything set up again like
