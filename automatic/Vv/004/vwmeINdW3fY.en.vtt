 next we're going to need bacon here 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.289
 I cooked it very well very golden 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.980
 cilantro cheese philadelphia natural a 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.330
 white 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.810
 that are to melt a game this 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.430
 game is natural but you can 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.290
 use the paste that you most 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.570
 like as there are quite a variety 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.250
 wide of games but good here we go to 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.010
 put our tile on this date 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.010
 previously heated with oil 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.080
 and I'm going to put pepper to taste 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 also garlic salt that is what I 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.060
 like to season 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060
 Y 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.510
 then I had to cover it so that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.570
 I knew the yolk to me I do not like 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.670
 the yolks and like this one 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.190
 uncooked so that it looks mari to me 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.840
 like cooked but already everyone and here 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.729
 I'm going to put the bacon on it, I'm going to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 put coriander in this case go hunting 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.649
 cilantro because I had no onions 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.899
 brians 2 little green that was what 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.730
 I normally use but today I did not have it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.100
 that I put coriander so good 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.370
 I'm going to put the cheese 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.660
 I'm going to cover it with a few seconds 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.350
 They have to take care of it obviously but 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.350
 Well let's 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.900
 and here what I'm going to do is leave 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.930
 beco to put it in my little oven as 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.930
 about five minutes just to touch it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.300
 but if you want it that way 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.740
 Well, you can leave it like that but I'm going to 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.140
 put in the hob like about five 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.060
 minutes nothing more than a little 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.060
 that that all of a little bit sorry 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.459
 and well is our tile 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.200
 with our cheese our cilantro 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.310
 our bacon today I can tell you 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.870
 this smells delicious and knows a baby 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.350
 delicious and good here I'm going to put 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.360
 this the philadelphia cheese to me then 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.100
 instead of using mayonnaise the truth because 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.000
 I'm not a big fan of the older ones so 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:15.330
 I prefer cheese and here I will put 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.060
 over what he had done nothing else 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.930
 and here I'm going to put the other one 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.420
 half and good so it is very easy truth 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.420
 and very rich for a good breakfast 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 and also what they can do is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.860
 cutting it to me makes it easier for me 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.030
 eat it like that because it's pretty much like 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.360
 chubby so I split in half and 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.110
 I'm nothing but sweet 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.110
 it's delicious 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.430
 I'm going to try it for you I'm sorry 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.940
