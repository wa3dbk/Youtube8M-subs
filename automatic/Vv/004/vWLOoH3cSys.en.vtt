00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
inside this little design here so from

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
inside this little design here so from
marking<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> marking<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.009> gonna<00:02:05.130> take<00:02:05.340> my

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
little utility knife you should probably

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.900 
little utility knife you should probably
use<00:02:07.530> an<00:02:07.649> exacto<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.759> one

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
use an exacto but I don't have one

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.580 
use an exacto but I don't have one
available<00:02:09.090> right

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
available right

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.160 
available right
so<00:02:09.830> I'm<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.039> using<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.180> works<00:02:11.360> okay

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I'm just using this and it works okay

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.509 
so I'm just using this and it works okay
it<00:02:12.440> doesn't<00:02:12.650> work<00:02:12.769> great<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.040> tears<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> paper

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
it doesn't work great it tears the paper

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.759 
it doesn't work great it tears the paper
a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.819> bit<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.180> fine<00:02:14.330> I'm<00:02:15.260> making<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
a little bit but it's fine I'm making a

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.339 
a little bit but it's fine I'm making a
little<00:02:15.950> line<00:02:16.220> from<00:02:16.790> line<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.209> line<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:22.000> then

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
little line from line to line and then

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.630 
little line from line to line and then
that's<00:02:24.349> gonna<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.709> for<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:24.980> ribbon<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.459> run

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
that's gonna be for my ribbon to run

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:34.960 
that's gonna be for my ribbon to run
through<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.480> from<00:02:31.330> outside<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:33.549> there<00:02:34.549> are<00:02:34.670> a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
through so from outside in there are a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.400 
through so from outside in there are a
couple<00:02:35.360> different<00:02:35.540> techniques<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.170> doing

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
couple different techniques to doing

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.229 
couple different techniques to doing
this<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.709> saw<00:02:36.860> somebody<00:02:37.069> actually<00:02:37.640> once<00:02:37.819> cut

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
this I saw somebody actually once cut

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.890 
this I saw somebody actually once cut
out<00:02:39.010> use<00:02:40.010> little<00:02:40.310> scissors<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.480> cut<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.660> out

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
out use little scissors and cut it out

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.750 
out use little scissors and cut it out
all<00:02:42.709> different<00:02:43.160> kinds<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.400> ways<00:02:43.519> but<00:02:43.700> I'm

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
all different kinds of ways but I'm

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.210 
all different kinds of ways but I'm
gonna<00:02:43.910> run<00:02:44.090> my<00:02:44.209> ribbon<00:02:44.480> through<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:44.750> way<00:02:45.220> on

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.119 

so<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.769> now<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.010> to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.690 
kind of test my lengths a little bit to
see<00:03:01.110> where<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.319> need<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.890> fold<00:03:02.220> I'm<00:03:02.549> gonna
