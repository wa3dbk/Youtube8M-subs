 after about 5 minutes 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.350
 see how we already have the caldito 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.380
 salsita that we prepared took a color a 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.050
 strongest red more intense for another 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.590
 side this we had not mentioned we have 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:48.410
 well here elena already has water ready 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:51.440
 already going low, you add the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.920
 sauce that we prepare that by reminding them 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.770
 this everyone was the chiles 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:04.039
 Fried with onion onion 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.169
 the tomato and onion ground very well 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.289
 we talk about this this is a very 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.830
 important dry shrimp head that 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.250
 has more this now so it's more 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.860
 it has more flavor the head of shrimp 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.169
 just like dried shrimp this is something 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.150
 this to pay attention because a lot 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.210
 people maybe because there is not the 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.639
 head or I do not like it turns out that you do not 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.440
 tells us is what they talked the most 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.520
 dried shrimp head what has more 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.919
 flavor then what we are going to do is 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.919
 liquefy and when shrimp heads 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.680
 ready elena 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.210
 now what do we do with it this is what 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.630
 let's add 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:57.240
 mayor that we already have here 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:59.009
 and we put it on it has not sneaked with lipton 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.770
 paradito 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.389
 very well then the dough follows 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.780
 now incorporate the dough and let's see 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.410
 how does he do it 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.410
 to return 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.680
 and then it 's the difference with what 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.650
 it would be a traditional soup 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.500
 bottom of the dough 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.849
 and we are constantly stirring 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.860
 mind shelf 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:32.099
 so that lumps are not made very well to 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.020
 then then the last step is 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:38.840
 the epazote is added very well 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.060
 that as you know the epazote is a 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.800
 honor herb a scent herb that 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.440
 gives a lot of flavor to dishes the 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.229
 dishes mainly to the guatapé of 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.629
 shrimp dry today not the one in this has a 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.629
 face that makes me that for a raw 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.710
 dead-awaker 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:00.080
 when he passed the Christmas glasses 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.750
 to don the ones for those who chose I put the 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.919
 shrimp to which they now put it is 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.919
 until the moment of serving 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.570
