00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
southeast of Galveston Texas and that is

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240 
southeast of Galveston Texas and that is
still<00:02:39.330> causing<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.960> lot<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.230> westerly<00:02:40.800> shear

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
still causing a lot of westerly shear

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.430 
still causing a lot of westerly shear
and<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> dry<00:02:42.390> air<00:02:42.600> being<00:02:42.960> pumped<00:02:42.990> in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.830 
and a lot of dry air being pumped in
from<00:02:43.470> Texas<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.910> therefore<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.510> storm<00:02:45.720> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
from Texas and so therefore the storm is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.170 
from Texas and so therefore the storm is
very<00:02:46.080> lopsided<00:02:46.460> however<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.700> wind<00:02:48.000> shear

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
very lopsided however the wind shear

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090 
very lopsided however the wind shear
values<00:02:48.570> are<00:02:48.870> gradually<00:02:49.560> beginning<00:02:49.860> to

decrease<00:02:50.520> over<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> storm<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.900> still

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
decrease over the storm so we still

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.510 
decrease over the storm so we still
expect<00:02:52.230> there<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.800> some<00:02:53.040> intensification

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
inclined to believe that this will

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.880 
inclined to believe that this will

remain as a strong tropical storm as it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.310 
remain as a strong tropical storm as it

little bit more and that's going to be

forecast<00:07:10.389> and<00:07:10.750> this<00:07:11.440> would<00:07:11.620> be<00:07:11.650> very

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
forecast and this would be very

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.800 
forecast and this would be very
problematic<00:07:12.250> for<00:07:12.849> some<00:07:13.090> of<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.360> low-lying

Plaquemines<00:07:18.400> Parish<00:07:18.819> because<00:07:19.479> we<00:07:19.599> would<00:07:19.750> so

European taken verbatim would indicate
that<00:07:24.190> this<00:07:24.430> would<00:07:24.639> be<00:07:24.669> a<00:07:24.940> minimal<00:07:25.449> category<00:07:25.900> 1

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:26.969
