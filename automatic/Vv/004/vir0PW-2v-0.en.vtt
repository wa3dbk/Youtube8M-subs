I<00:00:01.970> picked<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.090> up<00:00:03.300> at<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.750> flea<00:00:04.140> market

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I picked this up at the flea market

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990 
I picked this up at the flea market
several<00:00:05.100> years<00:00:05.490> ago

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
several years ago

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.200 
several years ago
and<00:00:08.240> I'm<00:00:09.240> not<00:00:10.010> exactly<00:00:11.010> sure<00:00:11.429> what<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.940> I

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and I'm not exactly sure what it is I

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.629 
and I'm not exactly sure what it is I
have<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> pretty<00:00:12.929> good<00:00:13.139> idea<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.740> we're<00:00:14.460> gonna

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
have a pretty good idea but we're gonna

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.960 
have a pretty good idea but we're gonna
find<00:00:14.940> out<00:00:15.179> our<00:00:15.690> tri-tip<00:00:15.990> anyway<00:00:16.640> says<00:00:17.640> bail

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
find out our tri-tip anyway says bail

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.340 
find out our tri-tip anyway says bail
system<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.199> front<00:00:25.199> looks

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
system and this is what the front looks

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.349 
system and this is what the front looks
like<00:00:26.930> looks<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.289> well-built<00:00:29.210> even<00:00:30.210> has

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
like looks like it's well-built even has

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.299 
like looks like it's well-built even has
a<00:00:30.390> strap<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> top<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.920> keep<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:34.309> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a strap on the top to keep it in and it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.459 
a strap on the top to keep it in and it
says<00:00:35.930> mega<00:00:36.930> ohms<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:39.530> looks<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.829> let's<00:00:41.280> see

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
says mega ohms and looks like let's see

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.119 
says mega ohms and looks like let's see
ok<00:00:43.469> homes<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:46.079> says<00:00:46.110> bail<00:00:46.590> systems

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
ok homes up here that says bail systems

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.810 
ok homes up here that says bail systems
here<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.750> gonna<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:50.219> its

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
here so I'm gonna take this out of its

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
here so I'm gonna take this out of its
case<00:00:51.170> which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:53.000> pretty<00:00:54.000> good<00:00:54.239> shape<00:00:55.250> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
case which is in pretty good shape and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.190 
case which is in pretty good shape and
we'll<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.030> about

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.590 

here's<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.920> closer<00:01:04.339> look<00:01:05.740> at<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.600> test

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
here's a closer look at this test

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.990 
here's a closer look at this test
equipment<00:01:11.440> it's<00:01:12.440> not<00:01:12.619> very<00:01:12.950> big<00:01:13.190> but<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.790> sure

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
equipment it's not very big but it sure

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.130 
equipment it's not very big but it sure
is<00:01:14.710> well-constructed

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
is well-constructed

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.810 
is well-constructed
here's<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.409> inside<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.220> on<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> left<00:01:19.700> you

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
here's the inside and on the left you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.080 
here's the inside and on the left you
can<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.270> battery<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.580> on<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.700> right<00:01:22.880> you

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
can see the battery and on the right you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.800 
can see the battery and on the right you
can<00:01:23.119> see<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.750> there's<00:01:24.619> not<00:01:24.920> much<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
can see that there's not much to the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.670 
can see that there's not much to the
meter<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.350> that's<00:01:27.950> because<00:01:29.259> this<00:01:30.259> meter<00:01:30.560> is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
meter and that's because this meter is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.510 
meter and that's because this meter is
made<00:01:31.780> for<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.840> specific<00:01:33.650> job<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:39.140> I've

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
made for a specific job and here I've

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.850 
made for a specific job and here I've
taken<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.820> battery<00:01:41.030> out<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.780> case<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
taken the battery out of the case and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.480 
taken the battery out of the case and
you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.759> see<00:01:44.119> that<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.509> runs<00:01:44.720> on<00:01:45.940> 45<00:01:46.940> volts

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.000 

okay<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.450> clean<00:01:52.900> this<00:01:53.140> up<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.900> have<00:01:56.049> zeroed

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
okay I clean this up and I have zeroed

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.080 
okay I clean this up and I have zeroed
the<00:01:57.040> meter<00:01:57.460> right<00:01:58.060> here<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.979> now<00:02:00.880> I'm<00:02:00.970> gonna

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
the meter right here and now I'm gonna

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.499 
the meter right here and now I'm gonna
turn<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.540> power<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:05.340> we'll<00:02:06.390> short<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.630> out

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
turn on power and we'll short this out

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:21.330 
turn on power and we'll short this out
so<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:11.040> zero<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.610> other

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.869 

all<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.209> that's<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:24.370> looks<00:02:24.640> pretty

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
all right that's a that looks pretty

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.160 
all right that's a that looks pretty
good<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.420> there<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:28.900> very

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
good right there and it is very

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
good right there and it is very
sensitive<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.879> is<00:02:30.970> made<00:02:31.300> for<00:02:32.040> reading<00:02:33.040> grounds

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
sensitive it is made for reading grounds

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.750 
sensitive it is made for reading grounds
but<00:02:34.629> in<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.890> case<00:02:36.129> using<00:02:36.459> 45<00:02:37.120> volts<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:39.580> is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
but in this case using 45 volts this is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.550 
but in this case using 45 volts this is
a<00:02:39.790> 10k<00:02:40.690> resistor

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.180 

and<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.630> alright<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.170> 10<00:02:51.440> mark<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and it is alright on the 10 mark and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.540 
and it is alright on the 10 mark and
this<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.430> divided<00:02:55.819> by<00:02:56.060> 10<00:02:56.420> now<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.720> right<00:03:00.200> on

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
this is divided by 10 now it is right on

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.760 
this is divided by 10 now it is right on
the<00:03:01.550> hundred<00:03:01.940> mark<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:04.840> looked<00:03:05.840> up<00:03:05.989> online<00:03:06.230> and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
the hundred mark I looked up online and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.820 
the hundred mark I looked up online and
found<00:03:07.190> out<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.830> telephone

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
found out that this is a telephone

leads<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.590> polarity<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.580> leads<00:04:10.200> and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
leads the polarity of the leads and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.810 
leads the polarity of the leads and
below<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.000> adjust<00:04:13.360> battery<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.110> button

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
below the adjust battery is a button

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.230 
below the adjust battery is a button
which<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.269> R<00:04:16.870> /<00:04:17.530> 10<00:04:18.130> button<00:04:20.850> now<00:04:21.850> here's<00:04:22.180> a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
which is the R / 10 button now here's a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.950 
which is the R / 10 button now here's a
much<00:04:22.930> closer<00:04:23.260> look<00:04:23.650> at<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.400> insides<00:04:24.960> see

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
much closer look at the insides see

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.000 
much closer look at the insides see
there's<00:04:26.200> not<00:04:26.350> much<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.920> it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.760 

1%<00:04:30.010> resistors<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:34.230> everything's<00:04:35.230> heavy-duty

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
1% resistors and everything's heavy-duty

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:43.290 
1% resistors and everything's heavy-duty
so<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.490> was<00:04:36.720> made<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.780> last<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.590> long<00:04:38.800> time<00:04:42.300> ok

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
so this was made to last a long time ok

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.300 
so this was made to last a long time ok
here<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:44.730> all<00:04:45.730> shined<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.480> and<00:04:47.370> put<00:04:48.370> back

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
here it is all shined up and put back

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.680 
here it is all shined up and put back
into<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.640> case<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.980> inside<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.510> left<00:04:55.510> a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
into the case and on the inside I left a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.930 
into the case and on the inside I left a
note<00:04:55.930> saying<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:57.460> takes<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:58.350> 45<00:04:59.350> volt<00:04:59.650> battery

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.750 

thanks<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.090> watching

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.820
