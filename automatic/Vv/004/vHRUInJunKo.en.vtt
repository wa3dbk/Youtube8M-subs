00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.860
 one day we're going to go in 1969 good in this 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.769
 level asks us to clear 100% of the 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.910
 important blocks already functional to the 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.990
 visit now go down under the screen 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 until it seems 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.960
 this balloon that to work 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.320
 that is going to look like a place 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.850
 inappropriate because if I have to throw the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.750
 strong and if you follow him 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 I would tell you to use them resell them 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.940
 and they have for deep it's about 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.000
 next and take it with an artificial 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 plus 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 that we are going to be able to take out the three blocks 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 of iron that are missing 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.430
 at least that we have to 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.430
 worry 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.890
 that I had in mind will be the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 help from that spring 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.680
 of the orbiters 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.260
 but they will not have another great help 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.240
 except that so try to accommodate more 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.220
 that all two cubes 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 these yellows that were left there 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.480
 so that I stay here treat me of you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.650
 that always in pairs 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.380
 go see how they are going to be for 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.960
 accommodate them well this green that is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 just there I'm going to do it with this is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 cortito 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.660
 there is now in the bag and I have left 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.050
 worry about that amarillistas nothing 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.170
