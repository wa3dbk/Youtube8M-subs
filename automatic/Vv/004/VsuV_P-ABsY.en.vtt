00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
American Waltz series use of the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.279 
American Waltz series use of the
standing<00:00:09.270> leg<00:00:11.210> if<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.510> don't<00:00:12.780> use<00:00:13.080> our

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
standing leg if we don't use our

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.039 
standing leg if we don't use our
standing<00:00:13.860> leg<00:00:14.209> which<00:00:15.209> would<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.510> my<00:00:15.719> right

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
standing leg which would be my right

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.290 
standing leg which would be my right
Betty's<00:00:16.830> left<00:00:17.100> that's<00:00:17.280> our<00:00:17.460> standing<00:00:17.970> leg<00:00:18.119> or

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Betty's left that's our standing leg or

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
Betty's left that's our standing leg or
our<00:00:18.390> supporting<00:00:18.900> leg<00:00:19.050> our<00:00:19.200> moving<00:00:19.530> leg<00:00:19.710> would

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
our supporting leg our moving leg would

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.160 
our supporting leg our moving leg would
be<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> opposite<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:21.120> left<00:00:21.360> legs<00:00:21.600> moving<00:00:22.020> her

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
be the opposite my left legs moving her

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.440 
be the opposite my left legs moving her
right<00:00:22.350> legs<00:00:22.590> moving<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.640> don't<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
right legs moving if we don't do that

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.120 
right legs moving if we don't do that
that<00:00:24.750> means<00:00:25.020> that<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.380> shifted<00:00:25.860> towards

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that means that we're shifted towards

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880 
that means that we're shifted towards
the<00:00:26.310> center<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> two<00:00:28.020> left<00:00:28.320> feet

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the center so this is two left feet

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
the center so this is two left feet
we're<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> middle<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.570> getting<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we're in the middle we're not getting on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
we're in the middle we're not getting on
one<00:00:31.170> foot<00:00:31.440> or<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> other<00:00:31.860> foot<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> use<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one foot or the other foot so to use the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
one foot or the other foot so to use the
standing<00:00:34.170> leg<00:00:34.350> let's<00:00:34.710> move<00:00:34.829> over<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.129> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
standing leg let's move over just a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
standing leg let's move over just a
little<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.809> use<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> standing<00:00:37.740> leg<00:00:37.920> we

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
little bit to use the standing leg we

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.130 
little bit to use the standing leg we
need<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> release<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> hip<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.020> lot<00:00:41.270> shift<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
need to release the hip a lot shift the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
need to release the hip a lot shift the
head<00:00:43.550> over<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.510> lining<00:00:45.720> up<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
head over so that we're lining up the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
head over so that we're lining up the
spine<00:00:46.560> more<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:47.700> Betty's<00:00:48.030> left<00:00:48.390> foot<00:00:48.720> I'm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
spine more over Betty's left foot I'm

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.479 
spine more over Betty's left foot I'm
gonna<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.380> ahead<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.620> move<00:00:49.829> her<00:00:49.980> head<00:00:50.220> she's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
gonna go ahead and move her head she's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
gonna go ahead and move her head she's
not<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.140> she's<00:00:52.350> no

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
not gonna like this right so she's no

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.130 
not gonna like this right so she's no
longer<00:00:52.649> over<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.220> standing<00:00:53.640> leg<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.690> she<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
longer over the standing leg now she is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.760 
longer over the standing leg now she is
yeah<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.280> she<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.730> turns<00:00:57.000> her<00:00:57.210> face<00:00:57.770> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
yeah if she just turns her face that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.200 
yeah if she just turns her face that
doesn't<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.309> her<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.610> standing<00:01:00.090> leg

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
doesn't put her over the standing leg

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.780 
doesn't put her over the standing leg
she's<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> pull<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.899> ear<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.489> rib<00:01:02.489> cage

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
she's got to pull that ear out rib cage

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.499 
she's got to pull that ear out rib cage
hip<00:01:03.329> knee<00:01:04.129> standing<00:01:05.129> leg<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.969> that<00:01:06.180> does

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
hip knee standing leg what that does

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.300 
hip knee standing leg what that does
that<00:01:06.810> gives<00:01:06.869> us<00:01:07.170> compression<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.159> bit

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that gives us compression a little bit

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
that gives us compression a little bit
longer<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> we've<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.020> swing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
longer so that we've got time to swing

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.680 
longer so that we've got time to swing
and<00:01:10.560> prepare<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.150> body<00:01:12.390> weight

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
and prepare and it has some body weight

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.730 
and prepare and it has some body weight
into<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:13.020> leg<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.590> push<00:01:13.860> off<00:01:14.990> very<00:01:15.990> hard<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
into that leg to push off very hard to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
into that leg to push off very hard to
do<00:01:16.920> slow<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.790> let's<00:01:18.000> speed<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.540> it'll<00:01:18.840> be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
do slow so let's speed it up it'll be

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
do slow so let's speed it up it'll be
harder<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.260> see<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:20.610> might<00:01:20.760> be<00:01:20.909> able<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
harder to see we might be able to do a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.010 
harder to see we might be able to do a
little<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.570> better<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> standing<00:01:24.570> leg<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
little bit better on the standing leg so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
little bit better on the standing leg so
we're<00:01:25.170> shifting<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.340> foot<00:01:26.610> I'm

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
we're shifting over that foot I'm

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
we're shifting over that foot I'm
releasing<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.210> hip<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.720> he's<00:01:27.840> releasing<00:01:28.200> hers

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
releasing my hip but he's releasing hers

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
releasing my hip but he's releasing hers
we're<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.220> standing<00:01:29.700> leg<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.600> should<00:01:30.810> be

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we're on that standing leg we should be

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.880 
we're on that standing leg we should be
able<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> swing<00:01:31.530> farther<00:01:32.990> swing<00:01:33.990> farther<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
able to swing farther swing farther and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
able to swing farther swing farther and
push<00:01:35.610> more<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.680> reverse<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.270> moving

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
push more now we reverse now I'm moving

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
push more now we reverse now I'm moving
into<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.930> left<00:01:40.470> hip<00:01:40.740> Betty's<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.280> her<00:01:41.369> right

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
into my left hip Betty's into her right

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.820 
into my left hip Betty's into her right
hip<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.150> we're<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.350> standing

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
hip a little bit we're into the standing

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.149 
hip a little bit we're into the standing
leg<00:01:44.240> still<00:01:45.240> offset<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.080> we<00:01:46.260> feel<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.979> we're

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
leg still offset but we feel that we're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
leg still offset but we feel that we're
into<00:01:47.490> Betty's<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:48.030> leg<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.470> push

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
into Betty's right leg now we can push

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.960 
into Betty's right leg now we can push
longer<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> reach<00:01:52.070> release

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.690 

and<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.210> couple<00:01:59.420> centered<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.280> we're<00:02:01.580> not

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and a couple centered so if we're not

over that leg we're centered I have a
little<00:02:04.250> bit<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.550> weight<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:04.730> my<00:02:04.970> left<00:02:05.180> she<00:02:05.360> has
