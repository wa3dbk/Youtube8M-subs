00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.630
 soft 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.440

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.849

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.520
 How about friends I bring you a video of 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.150
 How to prevent your console from stalling 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.160
 playstation 3 slim good we will use 4 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.130
 supports to raise the console well 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.830
 prevents it from overheating we will also use 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.390
 a clear 12 volt cooler should be 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.510
 adapted a small transformer for 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.609
 so it works 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.910
 well this is how it should be after 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.500
 console recommendations number 1 avoid 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 that the console is attached to the wall 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.539
 you should always leave a space number 2 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.579
 that the cooler should not put the air into 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.619
 console since it will help to make it enter 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.539
 more dust to the console which is not 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.629
 recommended the cooler should help 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.729
 extract internal heat but three 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.979
 play maximum two hours and leave 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.990
 rest for at least an hour and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.320
 half 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.170
 number 4 that there are no objects on top of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.960
 the console 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.210
 that will help a lot to flow the air the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.310
 console number 5 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.040
 after playing leave aired a 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.080
 good weather and then cover it with a 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.380
 flannel or rag what you have 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.940
 so that no more good dust enters 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.470
