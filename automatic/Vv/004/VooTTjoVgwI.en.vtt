00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
all right so what I did was I put my

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.120 
all right so what I did was I put my
thumb<00:01:09.370> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.730> third<00:01:10.000> fret<00:01:10.240> E<00:01:10.300> string<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
down strum on that and I kind of had a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.110 
down strum on that and I kind of had a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.120 

still<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.160> that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
still have that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.250

still there

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.730 
still there
already

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.640 

instead<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.700> D<00:02:42.850> all<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.170> alternates

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
instead of D all right so it alternates

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.710 
instead of D all right so it alternates
first<00:02:45.430> time<00:02:45.640> through<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:45.940> d<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.240> second<00:02:46.600> time

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
first time through is d the second time

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.180 
first time through is d the second time
through<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.960> ends<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.290> okay<00:02:47.770> but<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> still

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
through it ends on it okay but you still

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.410 
through it ends on it okay but you still

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.999 
the way back to the beginning you want
to<00:06:07.330> mute<00:06:07.479> it<00:06:07.629> so<00:06:07.840> do<00:06:07.960> you<00:06:08.050> go<00:06:09.659> you<00:06:10.659> you<00:06:10.960> know<00:06:11.469> and

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
to mute it so do you go you you know and

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.100 
to mute it so do you go you you know and
do<00:06:12.099> your<00:06:12.249> thing

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
do your thing

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.360 
do your thing
alright<00:06:14.110> so<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.409> song<00:06:14.590> continues<00:06:15.039> on<00:06:15.159> you

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
alright so the song continues on you

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.619 
alright so the song continues on you
have<00:06:15.490> a<00:06:15.520> little<00:06:15.699> Solo<00:06:16.029> in<00:06:16.210> there<00:06:16.419> it's

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
have a little Solo in there it's

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.510 
have a little Solo in there it's
actually<00:06:17.139> done<00:06:17.289> by<00:06:17.439> a<00:06:17.469> guitar<00:06:17.830> and<00:06:18.009> I<00:06:18.069> think

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
actually done by a guitar and I think

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.399 
actually done by a guitar and I think
some<00:06:19.090> other<00:06:19.270> effects<00:06:19.779> it's<00:06:19.900> either<00:06:20.050> guitar

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
some other effects it's either guitar

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.999 
some other effects it's either guitar
with<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.650> bunch<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:21.300> various<00:06:22.300> effects<00:06:22.689> and<00:06:23.590> then

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
with a bunch of various effects and then

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.089 
with a bunch of various effects and then
another<00:06:24.250> regular<00:06:25.000> guitar<00:06:25.090> playing<00:06:25.599> or<00:06:26.099> it's

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
another regular guitar playing or it's

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.409 
another regular guitar playing or it's
something<00:06:27.430> weird<00:06:27.639> and<00:06:27.789> there<00:06:27.939> may<00:06:28.150> be<00:06:28.180> like<00:06:28.389> a

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
something weird and there may be like a

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.499 
something weird and there may be like a
synthesizer<00:06:28.990> or<00:06:29.229> something<00:06:29.500> like<00:06:29.590> that<00:06:29.650> um<00:06:30.509> so

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
synthesizer or something like that um so

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.719 
synthesizer or something like that um so
after<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:32.110> solo<00:06:32.349> and<00:06:32.529> everything<00:06:32.979> you<00:06:33.430> go

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
after the solo and everything you go

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.119 
after the solo and everything you go
back<00:06:33.969> in<00:06:34.330> you<00:06:34.599> repeat<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:34.960> chorus<00:06:35.199> and<00:06:35.650> it

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:36.129 
back in you repeat the chorus and it

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.529 
back in you repeat the chorus and it
goes<00:06:36.250> into<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.550> verse<00:06:36.729> and<00:06:37.060> then<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.300> song

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
goes into a verse and then the song

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.700 
goes into a verse and then the song
actually<00:06:37.839> ends<00:06:38.830> on<00:06:39.039> this<00:06:39.339> okay<00:06:39.729> it<00:06:40.180> goes

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.190 

so<00:06:43.220> it<00:06:43.340> ends<00:06:43.760> on<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.480> D<00:06:44.660> instead<00:06:45.230> of<00:06:45.320> going

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.750 

or<00:06:48.320> most<00:06:49.010> people<00:06:49.160> would<00:06:49.340> think<00:06:49.430> you<00:06:49.580> end<00:06:49.700> on

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
or most people would think you end on

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.910 
or most people would think you end on
the<00:06:49.880> a<00:06:49.910> but<00:06:50.180> you<00:06:50.270> actually<00:06:50.420> on<00:06:50.660> the<00:06:50.840> D<00:06:50.990> so
