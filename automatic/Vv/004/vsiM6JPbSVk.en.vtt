welcome back to Minecraft you want to
know<00:00:03.840> what<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> haven't<00:00:04.710> done<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.370> long<00:00:05.400> time

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
know what I haven't done in a long time

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.419 
know what I haven't done in a long time
well<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.200> know<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.040> probably<00:00:08.250> name

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
well you know what you can probably name

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.709 
well you know what you can probably name
a<00:00:08.490> lot<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.790> things<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> haven't<00:00:09.360> done<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> long

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
a lot of things I haven't done a long

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
a lot of things I haven't done a long
time<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.740> particular<00:00:11.250> I'm

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
time but the one in particular I'm

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
time but the one in particular I'm
thinking<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.780> been<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> while<00:00:13.200> since<00:00:13.500> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
thinking of is it's been a while since I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
thinking of is it's been a while since I
last<00:00:13.679> went<00:00:14.099> over<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> redstone<00:00:14.849> related<00:00:15.330> mod<00:00:15.480> so

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
last went over a redstone related mod so

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.420 
last went over a redstone related mod so
that's<00:00:16.289> exactly<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> do

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that's exactly what we're going to do

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.429 
that's exactly what we're going to do
here<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> called<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> redstone<00:00:19.109> paced

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
here this is called the redstone paced

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.550 
here this is called the redstone paced
mod<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.070> think<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.240> vertical<00:00:22.109> redstone

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
mod and think of it as vertical redstone

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.950 
mod and think of it as vertical redstone
but<00:00:22.830> taken<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> next<00:00:23.910> level<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
but taken up to the next level so the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.390 
but taken up to the next level so the
mod<00:00:25.109> adds<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.529> new<00:00:25.650> block<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> game

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
mod adds a new block into the game

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.210 
mod adds a new block into the game
called<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.570> guessed<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.990> redstone<00:00:28.560> paste<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
called you guessed it redstone paste and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.269 
called you guessed it redstone paste and
it's<00:00:30.210> basically<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.560> improved<00:00:31.980> version

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's basically just an improved version

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
it's basically just an improved version
of<00:00:32.730> redstone<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> way<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.690> craft<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
of redstone so the way you craft it is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.990 
of redstone so the way you craft it is
by<00:00:34.590> combining<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.130> slime<00:00:35.370> ball<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> piece

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
by combining a slime ball with a piece

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
by combining a slime ball with a piece
of<00:00:36.149> redstone<00:00:36.270> dust<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.250> you'll<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.489> four

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of redstone dust and you'll get four

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.229 
of redstone dust and you'll get four
pieces<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.300> redstone<00:00:39.480> paste<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.200> return<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
pieces of redstone paste in return and

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
pieces of redstone paste in return and
basically<00:00:42.239> redstone<00:00:42.840> paste<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.559> placed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
basically redstone paste can be placed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.840 
basically redstone paste can be placed
on<00:00:44.129> any<00:00:44.430> surface<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.750> block<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
on any surface of a block so to use this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
on any surface of a block so to use this
as<00:00:48.149> an<00:00:48.360> example<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.289> wanted<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> get

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
as an example here if we wanted to get

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
as an example here if we wanted to get
this<00:00:49.950> door<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> open<00:00:50.370> without<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.660> any

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this door to open without using any

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
this door to open without using any
redstone<00:00:52.440> torches<00:00:52.739> whatsoever<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
redstone torches whatsoever we can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.630 
redstone torches whatsoever we can
simply<00:00:54.390> place<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.039> redstone<00:00:56.399> paste

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
simply place down the redstone paste

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
simply place down the redstone paste
which<00:00:56.879> you'll<00:00:57.270> notice<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.199> actually

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
which you'll notice there are actually

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.000 
which you'll notice there are actually
four<00:00:59.309> sides<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.329> each<00:01:00.780> block<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
four sides of each block that you can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.810 
four sides of each block that you can
put<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.399> on

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
put it down on

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.810 
put it down on
so<00:01:02.940> rather<00:01:03.239> than<00:01:03.420> redstone<00:01:04.199> where<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.729> can

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so rather than redstone where you can

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
so rather than redstone where you can
only<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> down<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.409> block<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.799> can't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
only put it down on the block you can't

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
only put it down on the block you can't
you<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.280> no<00:01:08.430> choices<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> sort<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> what

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you have no choices to sort of what

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
you have no choices to sort of what
direction<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.799> pointing<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
direction it's it's pointing out from it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
direction it's it's pointing out from it
just<00:01:11.580> sort<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> Auto<00:01:12.060> connects<00:01:12.570> however<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just sort of Auto connects however it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
just sort of Auto connects however it
pleases<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.090> choose<00:01:15.570> which

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
pleases you can actually choose which

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
pleases you can actually choose which
direction<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.740> redstone<00:01:17.100> paste<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> pointed

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
direction the redstone paste is pointed

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
direction the redstone paste is pointed
so<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.290> ahead<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so if we want to go ahead and have it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
so if we want to go ahead and have it
connect<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> door<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
connect with the door up there we just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.249 
connect with the door up there we just
keep<00:01:22.280> placing<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.360> sides<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
keep placing it up the sides of the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.550 
keep placing it up the sides of the
block<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.720> under<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:27.869> top<00:01:28.110> blocks<00:01:28.380> as

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
block and then under these top blocks as

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
block and then under these top blocks as
well<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.159> overhangs<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> then

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
well it can go on overhangs and then

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300 
well it can go on overhangs and then
once<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.290> connect<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> block<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
once we connect it with the block that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340 
once we connect it with the block that
the<00:01:32.430> door<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> let's<00:01:33.600> add<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lever<00:01:34.140> down

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the door is on let's add a lever down

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.300 
the door is on let's add a lever down
here<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.970> boom<00:01:35.970> doors<00:01:36.780> open<00:01:37.110> pretty<00:01:37.740> frickin

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
here and boom doors open pretty frickin

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.969 
here and boom doors open pretty frickin
cool<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.810> green<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> off

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
cool so it's green when it's in the off

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.010 
cool so it's green when it's in the off
state<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.880> orange<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
state and it's orange when it's in the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
state and it's orange when it's in the
on<00:01:43.170> state<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.759> regular<00:01:44.939> redstone

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on state and just like regular redstone

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
on state and just like regular redstone
it<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> range<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.159> 16<00:01:47.579> blocks<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it goes for a range of 16 blocks and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.870 
it goes for a range of 16 blocks and
then<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> fades<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.649> its<00:01:49.829> regular<00:01:50.340> green

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
then it fades out to its regular green

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.960 
then it fades out to its regular green
color<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.500> notice<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.159> redstone

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
color so as you notice here redstone

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.880 
color so as you notice here redstone
paste<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.509> redstone<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.439> run<00:01:55.619> side

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
paste and redstone can actually run side

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.280 
paste and redstone can actually run side
by<00:01:55.920> side<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.450> actually<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.990> two

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
by side so you can actually have two

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.859 
by side so you can actually have two
parallel<00:01:58.799> lines<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.369> current<00:01:59.640> without<00:02:00.600> them

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
parallel lines of current without them

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
parallel lines of current without them
messing<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.649> each<00:02:01.829> other<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.640> allows<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
messing with each other which allows you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.959 
messing with each other which allows you
to<00:02:03.329> sort<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:04.950> make<00:02:05.520> circuits

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to sort of really really make circuits

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
to sort of really really make circuits
more<00:02:06.299> compact<00:02:06.780> although<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> same<00:02:07.649> time

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
more compact although at the same time

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
more compact although at the same time
you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.280> also<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.700> place<00:02:09.300> lines<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can also just place lines of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449 
you can also just place lines of
redstone<00:02:10.379> paste<00:02:10.679> next<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.039> each<00:02:11.129> other<00:02:11.310> as

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
redstone paste next to each other as

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.190 
redstone paste next to each other as
well<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.300> mean

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
well so I mean

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.240 
well so I mean
if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> still<00:02:13.530> want<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.770> use<00:02:13.830> your<00:02:14.099> redstone

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
if you still want to use your redstone

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300 
if you still want to use your redstone
you<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.599> option<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.560> also<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:17.160> able

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you have that option and it also is able

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
you have that option and it also is able
to<00:02:17.640> interconnect<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> redstone<00:02:18.870> paste

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
to interconnect with the redstone paste

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
to interconnect with the redstone paste
we<00:02:19.769> turn<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.099> off<00:02:20.280> right<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.390> has

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
we turn this off right here so this has

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
we turn this off right here so this has
no<00:02:21.840> current<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.129> we<00:02:23.700> add<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.910> little

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
no current in it but we add a little

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
no current in it but we add a little
side<00:02:24.629> connector<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.709> again<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
side connector here so again see the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.530 
side connector here so again see the
little<00:02:26.610> highlighting<00:02:27.060> box<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
little highlighting box in the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.080 
little highlighting box in the
right-hand<00:02:27.930> corner<00:02:28.110> boom<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.819> connects

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
right-hand corner boom now it connects

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
right-hand corner boom now it connects
with<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> regular<00:02:30.720> redstone<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.140> you'll

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
with the regular redstone and you'll

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.740 
with the regular redstone and you'll
notice<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> current<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.390> flowing

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
notice that the current is now flowing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
notice that the current is now flowing
through<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.650> redstone<00:02:34.980> paste<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.970> pretty

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
through the redstone paste so pretty

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.900 
through the redstone paste so pretty
cool<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.739> choose<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.160> interconnect<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
cool you can choose to interconnect it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 
cool you can choose to interconnect it
with<00:02:39.000> redstone<00:02:39.269> if<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> want<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.620> only

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
with redstone if you want but it's only

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.130 
with redstone if you want but it's only
optional<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.970> there<00:02:42.629> we<00:02:42.750> go

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
optional so there we go

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.589 
optional so there we go
that's<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.620> basic<00:02:44.069> gist<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.580> how<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.420> works

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
that's the basic gist of how it works

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.479 
that's the basic gist of how it works
now<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.080> set<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.620> few<00:02:46.799> examples<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.340> so

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
now I just set up a few examples here so

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.039 
now I just set up a few examples here so
you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.819> see<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> interacts<00:02:48.540> redstone

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
you can see how it interacts redstone

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.800 
you can see how it interacts redstone
torches<00:02:49.470> goes<00:02:49.830> up<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.640> sides<00:02:50.910> walls<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
torches goes up the sides walls and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
torches goes up the sides walls and
overhangs<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.709> forth<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:53.160> is

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
overhangs so on and so forth so this is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.589 
overhangs so on and so forth so this is
just<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.489> little<00:02:53.700> example<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.180> an<00:02:54.299> inverter

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
just a little example of an inverter

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.319 
just a little example of an inverter
that's<00:02:55.530> done<00:02:55.799> actually<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> side<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
that's done actually on the side of the

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.449 
that's done actually on the side of the
block<00:02:57.540> instead<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.349> normal<00:02:58.950> redstone<00:02:59.340> which

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
block instead of normal redstone which

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.559 
block instead of normal redstone which
would<00:02:59.670> obviously<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.360> interact

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
would obviously have to interact

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.289 
would obviously have to interact
horizontally<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.160> flip<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.090> off

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
horizontally so flip it on and off

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.690 
horizontally so flip it on and off
you'll<00:03:03.599> notice<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.230> torch<00:03:04.470> will<00:03:05.310> invert

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you'll notice that the torch will invert

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.809 
you'll notice that the torch will invert
when<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> turned<00:03:07.049> on<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.640> that's<00:03:08.640> just

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
when this is turned on and that's just

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.370 
when this is turned on and that's just
one<00:03:08.970> example<00:03:09.000> right<00:03:09.510> there<00:03:09.660> another<00:03:09.930> really

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
one example right there another really

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.890 
one example right there another really
cool<00:03:10.590> thing<00:03:10.650> note<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:12.239> despite<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.870> fact

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
cool thing note is that despite the fact

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.380 
cool thing note is that despite the fact
that<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.709> by<00:03:13.920> one<00:03:14.160> area<00:03:14.519> should

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that this one by one area should

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.870 
that this one by one area should
technically<00:03:16.019> only<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.470> able<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.799> have<00:03:17.670> one

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
technically only be able to have one

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.910 
technically only be able to have one
block<00:03:18.090> occupying<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.230> example<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.769> put

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
block occupying it for example if I put

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.330 
block occupying it for example if I put
redstone<00:03:20.430> right<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:20.959> then<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:23.130> that's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
redstone right there then I like that's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.650 
redstone right there then I like that's
all<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:23.850> all<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.000> could<00:03:24.180> do<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.299> could<00:03:24.420> just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
all it's all I could do I could just

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.210 
all it's all I could do I could just
place<00:03:24.900> redstone<00:03:25.139> there<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.709> occupies

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
place redstone there and that occupies

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.610 
place redstone there and that occupies
the<00:03:26.489> entire<00:03:26.519> 1x1<00:03:27.510> space<00:03:27.750> whereas<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the entire 1x1 space whereas with the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.710 
the entire 1x1 space whereas with the
redstone<00:03:29.010> paste<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:30.000> actually<00:03:30.299> have<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.450> on

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
redstone paste I can actually have it on

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.110 
redstone paste I can actually have it on
the<00:03:31.139> bottom<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.889> have<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.310> side<00:03:32.489> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the bottom I can have it on the side and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670 
the bottom I can have it on the side and
I<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.359> have<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> other<00:03:33.930> side<00:03:34.049> or<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I can have it on the other side or the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.319 
I can have it on the other side or the
top<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.760> if<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.420> flip<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.139> lever<00:03:37.639> boom<00:03:38.639> torch

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
top so if I flip this lever boom torch

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.620 
top so if I flip this lever boom torch
goes<00:03:39.540> off<00:03:39.750> pretty<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:41.430> darn<00:03:41.760> useful<00:03:42.329> in

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
goes off pretty pretty darn useful in

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.270 
goes off pretty pretty darn useful in
being<00:03:43.139> able<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.380> make<00:03:43.500> things<00:03:43.799> far<00:03:44.250> more

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
being able to make things far more

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.030 
being able to make things far more
compact<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.090> again<00:03:45.299> just<00:03:46.019> keeps<00:03:46.260> on<00:03:46.470> inverting

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
compact so again just keeps on inverting

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
compact so again just keeps on inverting
it<00:03:47.100> inverts<00:03:47.579> both<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:48.000> them<00:03:48.120> because<00:03:48.450> this

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it inverts both of them because this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.030 
it inverts both of them because this
redstone<00:03:48.930> paste<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> side<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.829> this

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
redstone paste is on the side of this

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.979 
redstone paste is on the side of this
block<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:51.030> redstone<00:03:51.359> paste<00:03:51.569> right<00:03:51.750> here

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
block and the redstone paste right here

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.500 
block and the redstone paste right here
is<00:03:52.170> on<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.950> underside<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.790> block<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.420> it

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
is on the underside of this block so it

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.140 
is on the underside of this block so it
gets<00:03:54.660> both<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> torches<00:03:55.639> pretty<00:03:56.639> freakin

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
gets both the torches pretty freakin

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.440 
gets both the torches pretty freakin
cool

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
cool

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.960 
cool
alright<00:03:58.349> so<00:03:58.680> that's<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.609> also<00:03:59.790> just

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
alright so that's that and I also just

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.910 
alright so that's that and I also just
set<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.630> up<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.049> show<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> current

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
set this up to show you that the current

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.890 
set this up to show you that the current
can<00:04:02.040> travel<00:04:02.430> downwards<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.180> well<00:04:03.389> as<00:04:03.540> upwards

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
can travel downwards as well as upwards

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.690 
can travel downwards as well as upwards
and<00:04:04.139> we<00:04:04.950> can<00:04:05.099> just<00:04:05.310> open<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.790> door<00:04:06.019> like<00:04:07.019> so

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
and we can just open the door like so

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.509 
and we can just open the door like so
alright<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.000> now<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.180> set<00:04:09.540> up<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.780> couple<00:04:10.319> of

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
alright so now I set up a couple of

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.920 
alright so now I set up a couple of
SuperDuper<00:04:11.519> basic<00:04:11.910> circuits<00:04:12.299> just<00:04:12.660> for

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
SuperDuper basic circuits just for

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.960 
SuperDuper basic circuits just for
another<00:04:13.560> proof<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.069> concept<00:04:14.549> as<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.790> how<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
another proof of concept as to how you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.120 
another proof of concept as to how you
can<00:04:15.299> make<00:04:15.690> things<00:04:15.870> far<00:04:16.109> more<00:04:16.260> compact<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.950> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
can make things far more compact so this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
can make things far more compact so this
is<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.370> NAND<00:04:17.849> gate<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.810> as<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.109> right<00:04:19.229> now<00:04:19.289> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
is a NAND gate so as of right now you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
is a NAND gate so as of right now you
notice<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.220> door<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.430> closed<00:04:20.789> because

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
notice that the door is closed because

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.420 
notice that the door is closed because
this<00:04:21.359> redstone<00:04:21.630> torch<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.109> off<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.590> order<00:04:23.340> to

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
this redstone torch is off in order to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.100 
this redstone torch is off in order to
get<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.640> door<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.849> open<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.570> have<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.780> flip

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
get the door to open we have to flip

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.760 
get the door to open we have to flip
both<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.470> these<00:04:25.590> switches

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
both of these switches

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.950 
both of these switches
boom<00:04:27.759> that<00:04:28.090> inverts<00:04:28.389> both<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.660> torches

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
boom that inverts both the torches

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.270 
boom that inverts both the torches
there's<00:04:29.169> no<00:04:29.259> more<00:04:29.410> current<00:04:29.620> flowing<00:04:30.130> through

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
there's no more current flowing through

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.999 
there's no more current flowing through
this<00:04:30.639> redstone<00:04:30.910> paste<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.319> torch<00:04:32.560> goes

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
this redstone paste and the torch goes

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.020 
this redstone paste and the torch goes
into<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.400> on<00:04:33.490> state

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
into the on state

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.059 
into the on state
I<00:04:34.060> made<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.020> sorta<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.470> show<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.919> the

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
I made this sorta to show that the

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.790 
I made this sorta to show that the
entire<00:04:36.430> am<00:04:36.759> gate<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.479> built<00:04:37.720> on<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.530> wall

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
entire am gate can be built on a wall

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.070 
entire am gate can be built on a wall
vertically<00:04:39.400> something<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:40.630> can't<00:04:40.900> do

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
vertically something that you can't do

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.439 
vertically something that you can't do
again<00:04:41.440> with<00:04:41.680> regular<00:04:42.250> redstone<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.910> again

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
again with regular redstone and again

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.110 
again with regular redstone and again
just<00:04:44.319> makes<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.800> entire<00:04:45.069> thing<00:04:45.400> far<00:04:45.849> more

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
just makes the entire thing far more

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.200 
just makes the entire thing far more
compact<00:04:46.539> so<00:04:47.050> yep<00:04:47.289> there<00:04:48.069> you<00:04:48.220> go<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.729> NAND<00:04:49.090> gate

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
compact so yep there you go a NAND gate

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.409 
compact so yep there you go a NAND gate
for<00:04:49.599> ya<00:04:50.130> alright<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.370> finally<00:04:51.849> this<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.240> just

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
for ya alright and finally this is just

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.460 
for ya alright and finally this is just
a<00:04:52.780> super<00:04:53.199> compact<00:04:53.889> RS<00:04:54.400> nor<00:04:54.580> latch<00:04:54.639> so<00:04:55.539> or<00:04:56.050> RS

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
a super compact RS nor latch so or RS

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.990 
a super compact RS nor latch so or RS
Snorlax<00:04:56.979> as<00:04:57.940> they<00:04:58.569> used<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.870> call<00:04:58.930> it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
Snorlax as they used to call it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.040 
Snorlax as they used to call it
previously<00:05:01.000> you'd<00:05:01.150> have<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.479> make<00:05:01.569> this<00:05:01.780> in

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
previously you'd have to make this in

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.379 
previously you'd have to make this in
like<00:05:02.319> a<00:05:02.349> three<00:05:03.250> by<00:05:03.400> three<00:05:03.430> or<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.000> two<00:05:04.060> by<00:05:04.360> three

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
like a three by three or a two by three

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.080 
like a three by three or a two by three
area<00:05:04.840> now<00:05:05.500> with<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.770> redstone<00:05:06.159> paste<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:07.060> can

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
area now with the redstone paste you can
