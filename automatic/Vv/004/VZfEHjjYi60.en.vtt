00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
on suppose when you deal with avocado

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.390 
on suppose when you deal with avocado
because<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:02.350> warmth<00:01:02.619> of<00:01:02.680> your<00:01:02.739> hands<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.280> the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
because the warmth of your hands and the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
at home you'll always it will get on

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.870 
at home you'll always it will get on
your<00:01:10.869> fingers<00:01:11.140> if<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:11.590> use<00:01:11.680> gloves<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.310> kind

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
move a little a little bit faster the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.560 
move a little a little bit faster the
avocado<00:01:20.710> doesn't<00:01:21.040> heat<00:01:21.369> up<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.210> first<00:01:22.420> thing<00:01:22.509> i

in<00:01:44.740> plastic<00:01:44.890> wrap<00:01:45.220> that's<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.820> key<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.060> this

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
in plastic wrap that's the key to this

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.670 
in plastic wrap that's the key to this
that's<00:01:46.479> going<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.690> cause<00:01:46.870> enough<00:01:47.170> friction<00:01:47.320> so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
that's going to cause enough friction so

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.440 
that's going to cause enough friction so
when<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:47.860> roll<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.340> sticks<00:01:48.700> down<00:01:48.909> tight<00:01:49.240> and

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
when we roll it it sticks down tight and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.000 
when we roll it it sticks down tight and
it<00:01:49.810> kind<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.020> comes<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.440> little<00:01:50.530> bit<00:01:50.740> so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
it kind of comes in a little bit so

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.469 
it kind of comes in a little bit so
you're<00:01:51.130> not<00:01:51.220> just<00:01:51.280> rolling<00:01:51.970> like<00:01:52.120> this<00:01:52.330> that

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
you're not just rolling like this that

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.090 
you're not just rolling like this that
just<00:01:52.600> keeps<00:01:52.870> sliding<00:01:52.960> will<00:01:53.620> create<00:01:53.920> friction

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
just keeps sliding will create friction

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.430 
just keeps sliding will create friction
and<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.520> will<00:01:54.640> help<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.510> come<00:01:55.659> together<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
and it will help it come together so you

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.570 
and it will help it come together so you
want<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.620> have<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.799> green<00:01:56.979> side<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
want to have the green side on the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.890 
want to have the green side on the
outside<00:01:57.880> first<00:01:58.060> its<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.299> presentation<00:01:58.750> side

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
outside first its a presentation side

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.810 
outside first its a presentation side
put<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.530> your<00:01:59.650> hand<00:01:59.860> and<00:01:59.979> then<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.670> kind

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
put it in your hand and then just kind

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.880 
put it in your hand and then just kind
of<00:02:00.940> slide<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:02.170> want<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.380> kind<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.560> shingle

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
of slide it you want to kind of shingle

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.380 
of slide it you want to kind of shingle
it<00:02:02.979> we're<00:02:03.370> going<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.549> put<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.820> avocado<00:02:04.090> on

down and then let it touch each other

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.760 
down and then let it touch each other
like<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.180> make<00:02:55.780> sure<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.260> plastic<00:02:56.590> wrap<00:02:56.680> is

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
like that make sure the plastic wrap is

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.960 
like that make sure the plastic wrap is
not<00:02:56.920> fold<00:02:57.130> underneath<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.610> won't<00:02:57.820> come<00:02:57.940> out

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
not fold underneath or won't come out

back it up a little bit and then I pinch

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.790 
back it up a little bit and then I pinch
the<00:03:00.430> sides<00:03:00.610> roll<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.600> again<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.050> then

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
the sides roll it up again and then

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.780 
the sides roll it up again and then
here's<00:03:02.980> where<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.160> plastic<00:03:03.430> wrap<00:03:03.520> comes<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
here's where the plastic wrap comes the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.130 
here's where the plastic wrap comes the
hand<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.000> want<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> pinch<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.390> sides<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.930> the

plastic wrap does the work for you I
don't<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.700> printing<00:03:06.970> pressure<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.360> it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
don't have to printing pressure on it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.580
