meanwhile I followed the same process to
build<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.239> bottom<00:04:21.480> section<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.170> my<00:04:22.710> hollow

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
build the bottom section of my hollow

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.970 
build the bottom section of my hollow
form<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.330> where<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.600> appreciate<00:04:25.380> multiple

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
form this is where I appreciate multiple

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.250 
form this is where I appreciate multiple
face<00:04:26.190> plates<00:04:26.460> since<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.330> make<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.810> threaten<00:04:28.140> my

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
face plates since I make and threaten my

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.040 
face plates since I make and threaten my
own<00:04:28.380> wood<00:04:28.800> faceplates<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.640> can<00:04:30.180> have<00:04:30.360> as<00:04:30.570> many

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
own wood faceplates I can have as many

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.500 
own wood faceplates I can have as many
as<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:31.380> want<00:04:31.590> in<00:04:31.890> any<00:04:32.160> size<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.760> I<00:04:33.060> want

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
as I want in any size that I want

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.060 
as I want in any size that I want
now<00:04:33.780> I've<00:04:33.930> switched<00:04:34.169> over<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.890> bottom

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
now I've switched over to the bottom

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.100 
now I've switched over to the bottom
section<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.850> hollow<00:04:36.060> form<00:04:36.390> I'll<00:04:36.900> do<00:04:37.080> a

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
section of the hollow form I'll do a

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.020 
section of the hollow form I'll do a
rough<00:04:37.470> hollow<00:04:37.770> now<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.700> get<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
rough hollow now just to get the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.900 
rough hollow now just to get the
interior<00:04:39.330> uniform<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.350> don't<00:04:41.040> want<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.430> do<00:04:41.550> very

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
interior uniform I don't want to do very

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.630 
interior uniform I don't want to do very
much<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.480> interior<00:04:42.990> until<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:43.830> sure<00:04:43.860> of

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
much of the interior until I'm sure of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:05:01.580 
much of the interior until I'm sure of
the<00:04:44.940> exterior<00:04:45.360> shape<00:04:59.480> at<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.750> point<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.260> still

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
the exterior shape at this point I still

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.290 
the exterior shape at this point I still
have<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.919> upper<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.430> lower<00:05:02.520> sections

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
have the upper and lower sections

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.050 
have the upper and lower sections
separate<00:05:04.230> I'll<00:05:04.680> reverse<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.220> top<00:05:05.610> section

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
separate I'll reverse the top section

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.780 
separate I'll reverse the top section
onto<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> tailstock<00:05:07.050> with<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> cone<00:05:08.100> Center<00:05:08.610> on

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
onto the tailstock with a cone Center on

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.830 
onto the tailstock with a cone Center on
the<00:05:09.090> live<00:05:09.240> Center

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
the live Center

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.740 
the live Center
I'll<00:05:09.960> tool<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.190> two<00:05:11.370> pieces<00:05:11.610> together<00:05:11.940> with

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
I'll tool the two pieces together with

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.930 
I'll tool the two pieces together with
only<00:05:13.169> tailstock<00:05:13.590> pressure<00:05:14.070> while<00:05:14.880> I

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
only tailstock pressure while I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:27.990 
only tailstock pressure while I
establish<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.020> exterior<00:05:16.650> profile

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.490 

now<00:05:29.000> with<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.300> exterior<00:05:29.659> completed<00:05:30.319> I'll

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
now with the exterior completed I'll

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.980 
now with the exterior completed I'll
hollow<00:05:31.009> out<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.490> bottom<00:05:31.819> section<00:05:32.060> my<00:05:32.750> gouge

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
hollow out the bottom section my gouge

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:58.100 
hollow out the bottom section my gouge
works<00:05:33.349> good<00:05:33.860> enough<00:05:34.129> for<00:05:34.580> this<00:05:34.759> task

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.770 

then<00:05:58.740> switch<00:05:59.130> to<00:05:59.370> finish<00:05:59.820> hollowing<00:06:00.240> with<00:06:00.630> the

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
then switch to finish hollowing with the

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:18.320 
then switch to finish hollowing with the
top<00:06:00.960> section

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.970 

finally<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.510> conclude<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.230> two<00:06:20.440> sections

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
finally I conclude the two sections

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.490 
finally I conclude the two sections
together<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:22.120> tailstock<00:06:22.540> supplies<00:06:23.320> the

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
together the tailstock supplies the

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.290 
together the tailstock supplies the
clamping<00:06:23.890> pressure<00:06:23.920> with<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:24.670> hollow<00:06:24.940> form

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
clamping pressure with the hollow form

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.540 
clamping pressure with the hollow form
now<00:06:25.540> glued<00:06:25.900> together<00:06:26.080> I<00:06:26.530> can<00:06:26.980> refine<00:06:27.310> its

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
now glued together I can refine its

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.090 
now glued together I can refine its
exterior<00:06:27.970> but<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:28.930> have<00:06:29.080> to<00:06:29.230> be<00:06:29.320> careful<00:06:29.500> I<00:06:29.920> know

exterior but I have to be careful I know

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.340 
exterior but I have to be careful I know
I<00:06:30.280> have<00:06:30.580> about<00:06:30.820> 3/8<00:06:31.270> inch<00:06:31.480> wall<00:06:31.720> thickness<00:06:31.750> on

little concave on the bottom by the way

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.140 
little concave on the bottom by the way
I<00:07:05.140> had<00:07:05.710> glued<00:07:06.010> the<00:07:06.250> base<00:07:06.430> section<00:07:06.670> to<00:07:07.030> the

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
I had glued the base section to the

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.810 
I had glued the base section to the
faceplate<00:07:07.360> with<00:07:07.780> standard<00:07:08.440> yellow<00:07:08.770> glue<00:07:09.010> I'll

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820

sanding off any remaining marks I

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.200 
sanding off any remaining marks I
usually<00:07:17.590> do<00:07:17.770> this<00:07:17.950> in<00:07:18.160> a<00:07:18.250> drill<00:07:18.520> press<00:07:18.550> which

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
usually do this in a drill press which

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.050 
usually do this in a drill press which
is<00:07:19.240> safer<00:07:20.050> than<00:07:20.200> using<00:07:20.380> the<00:07:20.650> lathe<00:07:20.800> and<00:07:21.160> voila

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
is safer than using the lathe and voila

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.110 
is safer than using the lathe and voila
