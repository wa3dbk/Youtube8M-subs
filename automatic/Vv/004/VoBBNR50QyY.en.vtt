fully in the glitch hold on we take a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.580 
fully in the glitch hold on we take a
this<00:02:49.099> wave<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:50.440> enemies<00:02:52.750> also<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.840> can't<00:02:54.410> get

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
this wave of enemies also you can't get

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.170 
this wave of enemies also you can't get
in<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.859> glitch<00:02:55.100> if<00:02:55.250> there's<00:02:55.489> like<00:02:55.640> some<00:02:55.670> right

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
in the glitch if there's like some right

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:05.350
