players i've got i've got the normal

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
players i've got i've got the normal
versions<00:00:35.399> instead<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> blues<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> simply

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
versions instead of the blues and simply

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
versions instead of the blues and simply
the<00:00:37.260> fact<00:00:37.289> that<00:00:37.590> i've<00:00:38.010> used<00:00:38.280> their<00:00:38.460> blue<00:00:38.610> cards

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the fact that i've used their blue cards

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520 
the fact that i've used their blue cards
and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.420> didn't<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.170> them

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and I didn't really think much of them

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.709 
and I didn't really think much of them
and<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> their<00:00:42.210> normal<00:00:42.329> cards

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and so I just got to their normal cards

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
and so I just got to their normal cards
basically<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> goalkeeper<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.039> one<00:00:44.610> then

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
basically so the goalkeeper is one then

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.939 
basically so the goalkeeper is one then
ones<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.960> iker<00:00:46.469> casillas

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
ones and that is gonna be iker casillas

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
Alba and this guy is very very quick I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
Alba and this guy is very very quick I
pro<00:01:40.649> lost<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> coins<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.549> though<00:01:41.640> as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pro lost a lot of coins and though as

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
pro lost a lot of coins and though as
there<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> Malon<00:01:43.049> match<00:01:43.170> Neymar<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.710> now

there is a Malon match Neymar out now
and<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.820> feeling<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> 25k<00:01:46.170> packs<00:01:46.439> could

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and I'm feeling that the 25k packs could

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.580 
and I'm feeling that the 25k packs could
destroy<00:01:47.009> his<00:01:47.040> price<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.590> 238,000

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
destroy his price and because we 238,000

of<00:05:06.560> Cavani<00:05:07.070> he's<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.580> high<00:05:07.940> defensive<00:05:08.389> workrate

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
of Cavani he's a high defensive workrate

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.629 
of Cavani he's a high defensive workrate
means<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.229> he<00:05:09.380> does<00:05:09.650> not<00:05:09.680> play<00:05:10.010> there<00:05:10.250> he

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
means that he does not play there he

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.120 
means that he does not play there he
probably<00:05:10.940> plays<00:05:11.210> about<00:05:11.389> there<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.199> there<00:05:12.770> for

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130
