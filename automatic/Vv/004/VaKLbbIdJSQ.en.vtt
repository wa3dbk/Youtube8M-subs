00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
back again here's the rear shock without

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.460 
back again here's the rear shock without
the<00:00:02.730> spring<00:00:03.060> now<00:00:03.810> next<00:00:04.080> thing<00:00:04.259> I'm<00:00:04.319> going<00:00:04.350> to

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
the spring now next thing I'm going to

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.530 
the spring now next thing I'm going to
do<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.740> clean<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.400> shot<00:00:05.700> really<00:00:06.060> well<00:00:06.390> because

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
do is clean the shot really well because

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080 
do is clean the shot really well because
I<00:00:06.660> don't<00:00:06.839> want<00:00:06.870> any<00:00:07.170> dirt<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.980> inside<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
I don't want any dirt going inside the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480 
I don't want any dirt going inside the
shock<00:00:09.389> when<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.660> take<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.050> apart<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:11.280> that

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
shock when I take it apart and on that

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.560 
shock when I take it apart and on that
note<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.269> also<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.500> important<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:15.269> clean

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
note it's also really important to clean

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930 
note it's also really important to clean
the<00:00:15.750> bike<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.289> well<00:00:16.619> before<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.190> before<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the bike really well before I before you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
working on a dirty bike of any kind
because<00:00:23.730> that's<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.090> bad<00:00:24.390> dirt<00:00:24.779> gets

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
because that's just bad dirt gets

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.990 
because that's just bad dirt gets
everywhere<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.310> even<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> power

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
everywhere and I don't even use a power

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
everywhere and I don't even use a power
washer<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.900> cannot<00:00:28.380> tell<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> how

especially<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> swingarm<00:00:34.980> barrington

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
especially into the swingarm barrington

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
especially into the swingarm barrington
they<00:00:35.880> rust<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.390> there<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> old<00:00:37.410> adage

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
they rust out there are the old adage

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.130 
they rust out there are the old adage
out<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> sight<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.489> mind<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.020> I'm

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
out of sight out of mind so then I'm

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
out of sight out of mind so then I'm
going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.829> next<00:00:41.070> oh<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.120> Maddie

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
going to do that next oh I think Maddie

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
going to do that next oh I think Maddie
wants<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.840> say<00:00:43.050> hello<00:00:43.340> she's<00:00:44.340> supervising

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
wants to say hello she's supervising

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.290 
wants to say hello she's supervising
Maddie<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> super<00:00:45.899> wonder<00:00:46.379> dog<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.950> she<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
Maddie the super wonder dog there she is

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
Maddie the super wonder dog there she is
another<00:00:48.300> good<00:00:48.480> shot<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> dog<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:50.039> then

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
another good shot of the dog and then

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
another good shot of the dog and then
I'm<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> proceed<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> shock

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
I'm going to proceed to take the shock

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.069 
I'm going to proceed to take the shock
apart<00:00:52.739> after<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.160> clean<00:00:53.780> first<00:00:54.780> thing<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
apart after it's clean first thing I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.590 
apart after it's clean first thing I
want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> reservoir<00:00:57.270> right

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
want to do is in the reservoir right

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
want to do is in the reservoir right
here<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.500> Schrader<00:00:58.829> valve<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here the Schrader valve I'm going to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.150 
here the Schrader valve I'm going to
unscrew<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.960> bleed<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
unscrew that and bleed off all the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
unscrew that and bleed off all the
nitrogen<00:01:02.370> pressure<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.899> really

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
nitrogen pressure because that's really

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
nitrogen pressure because that's really
important<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:04.769> what's<00:01:05.100> happening<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
important because what's happening on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.480 
important because what's happening on
the<00:01:05.640> inside<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> bladder<00:01:07.619> inside<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the inside there's a bladder inside of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.750 
the inside there's a bladder inside of
here<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.570> charged<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.409> 150<00:01:11.010> psi

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
here that's charged with about 150 psi

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
here that's charged with about 150 psi
of<00:01:11.970> nitrogen<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> oil<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.640> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of nitrogen and then the oil is all on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
of nitrogen and then the oil is all on
this<00:01:15.240> part<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this part right in here and what the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.910 
this part right in here and what the
nitrogen<00:01:17.759> does<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.750> help<00:01:19.350> stabilize<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
nitrogen does and help stabilize the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
nitrogen does and help stabilize the
damping<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> air<00:01:22.020> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
damping because if you get in the air in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
damping because if you get in the air in
the<00:01:22.409> shock<00:01:22.939> during<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> bleeding<00:01:24.570> process<00:01:25.049> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the shock during the bleeding process on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
the shock during the bleeding process on
upon<00:01:25.619> assembly<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:27.000> helps<00:01:27.330> minimize<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
upon assembly that helps minimize the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
upon assembly that helps minimize the
foaming<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> oil<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.520> really

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
foaming of the oil so it's really

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
foaming of the oil so it's really
important<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
important that you because you want to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
important that you because you want to
be<00:01:31.770> able<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> take<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> apart<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
be able to take it apart and then when I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
be able to take it apart and then when I
take<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> es<00:01:34.159> now<00:01:35.159> bleed<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> air<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.299> the
