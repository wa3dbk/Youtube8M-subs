00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
mature skin as well so personally I do

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.770 
mature skin as well so personally I do
prefer<00:00:53.649> matte<00:00:53.890> blushes<00:00:54.160> some<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.149> shimmer

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
prefer matte blushes some of the shimmer

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.270 
prefer matte blushes some of the shimmer
bright<00:00:56.079> blushes<00:00:56.469> can<00:00:56.680> get<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.829> little<00:00:56.920> bit<00:00:57.100> too

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
bright blushes can get a little bit too

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.620 
bright blushes can get a little bit too
shimmery<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.700> therefore<00:00:58.149> if<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.329> have<00:00:58.480> any

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
shimmery and therefore if you have any

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.840 
shimmery and therefore if you have any
you<00:00:59.110> know<00:00:59.140> problems<00:00:59.770> breakouts<00:01:00.430> on<00:01:00.579> your<00:01:00.700> face

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
you know problems breakouts on your face

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.700 
you know problems breakouts on your face
and<00:01:01.120> stuff<00:01:01.329> it<00:01:01.540> can<00:01:01.660> actually<00:01:01.930> accentuate

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
and stuff it can actually accentuate

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.069 
and stuff it can actually accentuate
that<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.879> really<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.449> this<00:01:04.600> blush<00:01:04.869> for

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
that so I really like this blush for

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.139 
that so I really like this blush for
that<00:01:05.229> reason<00:01:05.560> like<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> burgundy<00:01:06.280> wine<00:01:06.759> sort<00:01:07.090> of

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
that reason like a burgundy wine sort of

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.719 
that reason like a burgundy wine sort of
color<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:07.719> like<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.560> name<00:01:08.709> flushed<00:01:09.159> because<00:01:09.609> it

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
color I like the name flushed because it

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.429 
color I like the name flushed because it
actually<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.509> that<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.990> just<00:01:11.170> gives<00:01:11.350> you

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
actually is that it just gives you
