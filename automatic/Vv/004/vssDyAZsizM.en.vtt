like<00:00:09.340> it's<00:00:09.490> hot<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.400> we<00:00:12.789> basically<00:00:13.059> went<00:00:13.539> over

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
like it's hot so we basically went over

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.510 
like it's hot so we basically went over
the<00:00:15.070> physics<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:17.320> a<00:00:17.830> stall<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.340> what's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
the physics of a stall and what's

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.839 
the physics of a stall and what's
happening<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.539> install<00:00:19.929> deploy<00:00:20.349> your<00:00:21.160> voice

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
happening and install deploy your voice

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.700 
happening and install deploy your voice
changing<00:00:22.449> direction<00:00:22.599> as<00:00:22.990> well<00:00:23.019> as<00:00:23.289> your<00:00:23.470> hand

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
changing direction as well as your hand

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.499 
changing direction as well as your hand
we're<00:00:24.160> going<00:00:24.339> hand<00:00:24.550> in<00:00:24.609> a<00:00:24.699> circle<00:00:25.060> install

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
we're going hand in a circle install

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.839 
we're going hand in a circle install
then<00:00:26.289> broke<00:00:26.710> your<00:00:26.919> poor<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.460> your<00:00:27.640> hand

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
then broke your poor and your hand

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.630 
then broke your poor and your hand
change<00:00:28.150> direction<00:00:28.539> when<00:00:29.289> you<00:00:29.380> do<00:00:29.619> that<00:00:29.829> by

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
change direction when you do that by

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.440 
change direction when you do that by
moving<00:00:31.210> your<00:00:31.539> hand<00:00:32.220> then<00:00:33.220> out<00:00:33.700> of<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.940> circle

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
moving your hand then out of the circle

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.480 
moving your hand then out of the circle
so<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.989> point<00:00:35.290> isn't<00:00:35.410> accelerated<00:00:36.190> back

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
so that the point isn't accelerated back

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.250 
so that the point isn't accelerated back
into<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.910> circle<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.420> curved<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:37.990> on<00:00:38.170> the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
into the circle and curved it on the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.130 
into the circle and curved it on the
patents<00:00:38.740> and<00:00:38.890> boy<00:00:39.160> just<00:00:39.460> gets<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.930> travel<00:00:40.930> on

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
patents and boy just gets the travel on

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
patents and boy just gets the travel on
the<00:00:41.530> straight<00:00:41.950> path<00:00:42.130> than<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:42.640> wants<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:43.030> town

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the straight path than it wants to town

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420 
the straight path than it wants to town
so<00:00:45.550> that's<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.290> business<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:47.860> stall<00:00:48.160> and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
so that's the business of this stall and

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.060 
so that's the business of this stall and
you<00:00:48.520> can<00:00:48.670> again<00:00:48.880> use<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.750> stall<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.890> any

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
you can again use that stall in any

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.040 
you can again use that stall in any
directions<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.730> can<00:00:51.760> stall<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.630> point<00:00:52.990> is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
directions you can stall the point is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.050 
directions you can stall the point is
right<00:00:53.200> here<00:00:53.590> always<00:00:54.460> going<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.760> go<00:00:54.820> straight

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
right here always going to go straight

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.440 
right here always going to go straight
up<00:00:55.270> it's<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.410> up

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.120 

and<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.960> can<00:01:00.080> slow<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.380> anywhere<00:01:00.650> along<00:01:00.920> this

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
and you can slow in anywhere along this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.500 
and you can slow in anywhere along this
circle<00:01:01.400> okay<00:01:01.880> stop<00:01:02.090> stop<00:01:02.800> good<00:01:03.800> solid<00:01:04.510> that's

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
circle okay stop stop good solid that's

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.690 
circle okay stop stop good solid that's
up<00:01:05.660> again<00:01:05.900> start<00:01:06.350> with<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.680> 45<00:01:07.100> degree<00:01:07.130> angle

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
up again start with this 45 degree angle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.180 
up again start with this 45 degree angle
you<00:01:08.180> can<00:01:08.330> start<00:01:08.480> at<00:01:08.720> any<00:01:08.750> angle<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:09.980> want

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
you can start at any angle that you want

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.650 
you can start at any angle that you want
to<00:01:10.370> all<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.120> then<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.420> can<00:01:11.570> we<00:01:11.660> use<00:01:11.870> that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
to all right so then you can we use that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.230 
to all right so then you can we use that
to<00:01:14.660> Row<00:01:15.590> installs<00:01:16.100> almost<00:01:16.610> anywhere<00:01:17.030> where

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
to Row installs almost anywhere where

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.750 
to Row installs almost anywhere where
you<00:01:17.270> have<00:01:17.770> some<00:01:18.770> sort<00:01:19.070> park<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:22.520> went<00:01:22.670> over

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
you have some sort park and we went over

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.660 
you have some sort park and we went over
then<00:01:23.300> some<00:01:23.540> common<00:01:23.900> moves<00:01:24.200> when<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.710> have<00:01:25.100> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
then some common moves when you have to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.160 
then some common moves when you have to
koi<00:01:25.960> because<00:01:26.960> usually<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.950> swing<00:01:28.310> one<00:01:28.520> and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
koi because usually the swing one and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.590 
koi because usually the swing one and
those<00:01:30.170> ones<00:01:30.440> were<00:01:30.710> variations<00:01:31.580> on<00:01:32.060> same

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
those ones were variations on same

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.020 
those ones were variations on same
direction<00:01:32.810> same<00:01:33.530> direction<00:01:33.680> same<00:01:34.040> time<00:01:34.280> when

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
direction same direction same time when

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.420 
direction same direction same time when
you<00:01:35.350> stall<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:37.970> mode<00:01:38.509> through<00:01:39.080> this<00:01:39.430> this

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
you stall in this mode through this this

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.580 
you stall in this mode through this this
pattern<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.720> boy<00:01:42.560> basically<00:01:44.410> girl<00:01:45.410> like<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
pattern you boy basically girl like that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.580 
pattern you boy basically girl like that
and<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:47.180> simple<00:01:47.869> your<00:01:48.229> hands<00:01:48.440> are

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
and it's it's simple your hands are

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.990 
and it's it's simple your hands are
moving<00:01:48.710> at<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.009> same<00:01:49.190> time<00:01:49.430> during<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.790> same

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
moving at the same time during the same

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.950 
moving at the same time during the same
thing<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:52.820> can<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.330> once<00:01:53.690> again<00:01:53.869> in

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
thing and you can do that once again in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.870 
thing and you can do that once again in
any<00:01:54.080> direction<00:01:54.259> from<00:01:54.680> up<00:01:55.009> which<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.729> really

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
any direction from up which is really

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.460 
any direction from up which is really
hard<00:01:56.149> we<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.600> hear<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.899> for<00:01:57.410> that's<00:01:57.649> side<00:01:58.420> up

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
hard we can hear it for that's side up

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.960 
hard we can hear it for that's side up
do<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.619> down<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.780> one<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.970> that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
do it down you can just do one and that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.460 
do it down you can just do one and that
actually<00:02:05.420> leads<00:02:05.810> us<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.550> butterfly<00:02:08.470> once

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
actually leads us to butterfly once

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.340 
actually leads us to butterfly once
again<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.830> same<00:02:10.039> time<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.150> do<00:02:11.300> a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
again it's the same time if you do a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.710 
again it's the same time if you do a
split<00:02:12.350> apart<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.160> very<00:02:13.760> interesting

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
split apart then very interesting

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.480 
split apart then very interesting

on the pattern position in the hands and
circles<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.290> been<00:02:39.470> moving<00:02:39.710> in<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.280> poor

circles have been moving in the poor
you're<00:02:40.580> going<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.760> always<00:02:40.940> have<00:02:41.350> consists<00:02:42.350> of

you're going to always have consists of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.870 
you're going to always have consists of
relationship<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.160> they're<00:02:43.340> always<00:02:43.460> very<00:02:43.580> in

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
relationship but they're always very in

relationship but they're always very in
same<00:02:44.060> direction<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.570> opposite<00:02:44.900> direction

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.000 
or equal to each other or something like
that<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.230> those<00:02:48.380> are<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.560> same<00:02:48.770> time

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
that so those are the same time

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
you can do that a butterfly in opposite

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.180 
you can do that a butterfly in opposite
directions<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.320> here<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.650> want<00:03:03.860> your<00:03:03.980> ploy

heads<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> tail<00:03:41.520> so<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.120> may<00:03:42.150> stop

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
heads to the tail so that one may stop

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
to kind of look like this which makes

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
to kind of look like this which makes
this<00:03:44.340> removable<00:03:44.790> interesting<00:03:45.780> effect<00:03:46.080> that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
this removable interesting effect that

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.680 
this removable interesting effect that
we<00:03:46.320> can<00:03:46.470> use<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.860> isolations<00:03:47.580> or<00:03:47.850> go<00:03:48.510> into

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
we can use with isolations or go into

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.230 
we can use with isolations or go into
other<00:03:49.320> moves<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.850> can<00:03:51.030> use

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
other moves like that and you can use

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.870 
other moves like that and you can use
those<00:03:51.750> relationships<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.430> want<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.790> do

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
those relationships and you want to do

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.020 
those relationships and you want to do
if<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.330> have<00:03:54.360> here<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.530> do<00:03:56.030> butterfly

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
if you have here you can do butterfly

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.990 
if you have here you can do butterfly
one<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.830> those<00:04:04.980> are<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.190> basic<00:04:05.520> variations

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
one so those are the basic variations

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.500 
one so those are the basic variations
that<00:04:06.090> he<00:04:06.240> went<00:04:06.390> over<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:08.010> was<00:04:08.510> majority

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that he went over and that was majority

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.150 
that he went over and that was majority

or too late how to fix any problems that
you're<00:04:21.390> having<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.989> then<00:04:22.530> briefly

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
you're having and then briefly

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.300 
you're having and then briefly
introduced<00:04:24.080> series

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.629 

now<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:29.060> really<00:04:29.480> introduced<00:04:30.340> several<00:04:31.340> other

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
now we really introduced several other

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.960 
now we really introduced several other
mood<00:04:32.480> more<00:04:32.930> advanced<00:04:33.230> moves<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.919> use<00:04:34.550> stalls

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
mood more advanced moves that use stalls

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.180 
mood more advanced moves that use stalls
or<00:04:35.270> utilize<00:04:35.660> them<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.710> didn't<00:04:37.040> really

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
or utilize them but I didn't really

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.810 
or utilize them but I didn't really
focus<00:04:37.820> on<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.330> one<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:38.840> there's<00:04:39.610> always<00:04:40.610> like

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
focus on this one so there's always like
