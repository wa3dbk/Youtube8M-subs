 Hello everybody! Mattias at the newspaper VEGO here. 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.420
 Welcome home to me. 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.600
 From now on I will share videos here on our Youtube channel. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.700
 There will be cooking, a little reportage, there will be tips and tricks on how you can get better at vegomat. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.600
 So follow us! 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.840
 Today I was going to invite one of my absolute favorite desserts. 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.500
 It is a giant chocolate cake with pears and pecans. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.020
 Super-easy, go super fast to prepare and aaah what it is good. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 We are running! 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.880
 The first thing you need is two cans of preserved pears. 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280
 Pour off the shovel from them, because you don't need to. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.660
 Then lay down the pears in a gratin shape with the cut surface facing downwards, so that the stomach points upwards. 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.040
 It's just to cover the bottom and then if they don't quite fit, just put them on top of each other. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 So they get a little together. 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.380
 For the batter you need 150 g of butter. I use milk-free butter. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.400
 Down with it in a pile. It should preferably be room temperature because it is easier to work with. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.880
 1.5 dl of light muscovado sugar. It also goes well with regular powdered sugar, but I like muscovado sugar 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.980
 because it gives a small colaton to this cake. 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.660
 2 dl of wheat flour. 

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:34.583
 0.5 dl cocoa, so good you can find. 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.720
 1 teaspoon baking soda. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 0.5 teaspoons of ground cinnamon. 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.720
 0.5 teaspoons ground cardamom. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.340
 And that is to get a little touchy on it all. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.080
 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.760
 1.5 dl of milk. Here I use soy milk, but it goes well with oatmeal or almond milk. 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
 The milk you like best. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.400
 Finally, if you want ... then you can add 1 tablespoon Amaretto. It also goes well with rum 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.300
 or Kirsch. Some good liqueur you like. 

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:25.240
 It's just pouring down. 

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:28.908
 And then it is just to mix up all this. 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 I do it with a balloon whip, but it is possible to run with a whisk or in a food processor. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.460
 It should be a pretty lump-free batter. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.360
 This is super easy. Let children do this, you can't make mistakes. 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 Then take out the pears and click out the batter over. 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.240
 There are no strange things. It doesn't have to be smooth and smooth or something. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.060
 Just click out and smooth it as best it can. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.280
 Then this batter will crawl down between the pears and become a lovely cake that is almost 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.320
 like a chocolate sauce in the bottom. Ah, it's ridiculously good. 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.820
 This can also be prepared and put in the fridge before guests arrive. 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.040
 But, it goes so fast to do. 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.280
 After all, you want all the pears to get a little batter so that they feel appreciated. 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.740
 Now the batter is in place and then it is time for the pecans. 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.200
 And there are 1 dl pecans. 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.780
 If you don't like nuts or are allergic, skip them. 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.000
 I love pecans, especially in combination with some carbon atoms, chocolate and pears. 

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.867
 This is amazing. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.995
 Then when the pecans are distributed it is just to throw the mold into the oven at 200 degrees 

00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:57.536
 for 30 minutes. 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.680
 Keep in mind that it should be very messy in the middle, that's what is good. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.700
 There you go! Now it has only gone 25 minutes but it feels ready, so I took it out. 

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:25.827
 Let's see... 

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:27.100
 Oh... 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.420
 I think it's perfect. Do you see? 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.740
 One can eat it as it is. I like to have a glass of ice cream for. 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.400
 And that was all! How simple was it? 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.800
 And I can only say one thing, it's totally sick good. 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.880
 That being said, the cookie cake with almost like a chocolate sauce in the bottom. The pecans have been slightly roasted in the oven. 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.980
 Oh, just that. Continue to follow us here on Youtube. You can find the recipe on vegomagasinet.se. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.500
 Promise me that you bake this because it is absolutely incomparable. Have a good one. Hey!
