part<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> brush<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.830> gonna<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.160> ahead<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
part of the brush I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360 
part of the brush I'm gonna go ahead and
just<00:02:14.820> add<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.060> tiny<00:02:15.390> bit<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.780> definition<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.470> do

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
just add a tiny bit of definition I do

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.010 
just add a tiny bit of definition I do
realize<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:18.510> she<00:02:18.660> needs<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
realize that I think she needs just a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.360 
realize that I think she needs just a
little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.410> more<00:02:19.530> definition<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:20.010> her<00:02:20.130> cheeks

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
little bit more definition on her cheeks

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.980 
little bit more definition on her cheeks
so<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> where<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.930> ahead

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
so this is where I'm going to go ahead

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.860 
so this is where I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:22.290> dip<00:02:23.190> into<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> deeper<00:02:24.150> shade<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and dip into that deeper shade in the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
and dip into that deeper shade in the
palette<00:02:24.900> called<00:02:25.290> subconscious<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.190> as

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
palette called subconscious and as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.460 
palette called subconscious and as
always<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.300> highly<00:02:27.810> recommend<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.170> going

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
always I highly recommend just going

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.320 
always I highly recommend just going
back<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.680> forth<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.670> blending<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.209> out

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
back and forth and just blending it out

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
back and forth and just blending it out
until<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.410> confirm<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.400> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
until you can confirm that you have a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.070 
until you can confirm that you have a
perfect<00:02:32.940> smooth<00:02:33.270> gradation

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.170 

I'm<00:02:39.080> gonna<00:02:39.319> go<00:02:39.440> ahead<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.620> focus<00:02:39.830> on

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I'm gonna go ahead and focus on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.850 
I'm gonna go ahead and focus on
Roxanne's<00:02:41.180> nose<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.019> said<00:02:42.230> before<00:02:42.410> she

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860

add a lot more dimension is just adding

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.089 
add a lot more dimension is just adding
a<00:02:50.030> tad<00:02:50.360> bit<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.599> contour<00:02:51.140> at<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.800> bridge<00:02:51.980> of
