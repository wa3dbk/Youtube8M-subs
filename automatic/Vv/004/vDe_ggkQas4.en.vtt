I<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.579> tried<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.910> create<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.660> elephant

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I have tried to create an elephant

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.950 
I have tried to create an elephant
the<00:00:38.760> other<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.090> times<00:00:39.660> happened<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.590> close

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
the other two times happened very close

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.029 
the other two times happened very close
together<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:44.660> single<00:00:45.660> week<00:00:46.020> period<00:00:46.860> for

together for a single week period for

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.650 
together for a single week period for
LEGO<00:00:47.190> creations<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.590> after<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> spent<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
LEGO creations and after I spent a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.779 
LEGO creations and after I spent a
considerable<00:00:51.660> amount<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> those

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
considerable amount of time on those

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.959 
considerable amount of time on those
they<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.030> didn't<00:00:54.270> turn<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.199> any<00:00:55.379> real

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
they just didn't turn out with any real

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
they just didn't turn out with any real
positive<00:00:56.969> representation<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.410> elephant

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
positive representation for an elephant

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
positive representation for an elephant
like<00:00:59.010> yes<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.789> was<00:00:59.910> obvious<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.750> were

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
like yes it was obvious what they were

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
like yes it was obvious what they were
but<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.649> didn't<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> outcomes<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
but I just didn't like the outcomes of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
but I just didn't like the outcomes of
it<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> hard<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.680> wrapping<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.159> head

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it I had a hard time wrapping my head

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
it I had a hard time wrapping my head
around<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.630> concept<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.439> trying<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
around the the concept I was trying to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.120 
around the the concept I was trying to
do<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> larger<00:01:08.760> scale<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.680> wasn't

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
do a larger scale and it just wasn't

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.719 
do a larger scale and it just wasn't
working<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.760> me<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.090> either<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:13.220> unable<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> go

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
working for me I either was unable to go

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.320 
working for me I either was unable to go
large<00:01:15.270> enough<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:16.640> wasn't<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:18.000> small

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
large enough or wasn't going small

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
large enough or wasn't going small
enough<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> mid-range<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.680> didn't<00:01:20.009> seem<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
enough the mid-range just didn't seem to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
enough the mid-range just didn't seem to
to<00:01:21.150> gel<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.920> decided<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.630> was

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to gel so I decided to make one that was

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
to gel so I decided to make one that was
minifig<00:01:25.470> sized<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:27.890> setting<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
minifig sized and setting out to do so I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.569 
minifig sized and setting out to do so I
didn't<00:01:30.000> realize<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.720> stepping<00:01:31.079> into

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
didn't realize what I was stepping into

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
didn't realize what I was stepping into
once<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.850> completed<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.420> elephant<00:01:34.049> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
once I have completed the elephant we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.760 
once I have completed the elephant we
were<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> looking<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
were kind of looking at it me and me and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.100 
were kind of looking at it me and me and
my<00:01:37.770> son<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.040> we're<00:01:38.640> figuring<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.720> different

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
my son and we're figuring out different

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
my son and we're figuring out different
things<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.619> concepts<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
things and concepts and one of the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
things and concepts and one of the
things<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.630> writing<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> elephant<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
things was writing in the elephant so

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
things was writing in the elephant so
this<00:01:45.030> came<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.720> I've<00:01:46.020> been

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this came about because I've been

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.080 
this came about because I've been
working<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> long-term<00:01:46.979> project<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.880> has

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
working on a long-term project that has

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.780 
working on a long-term project that has
to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> castle<00:01:48.990> sets<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.460> find

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
to do with the castle sets you will find

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
to do with the castle sets you will find
out<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:50.970> about<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.869> time<00:01:52.829> goes<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
out more about that as time goes on I

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.030 
out more about that as time goes on I
imagine

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
imagine

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.780 
imagine
but<00:01:54.370> this<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:54.850> how<00:01:55.800> what<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:56.920> see<00:01:57.160> came<00:01:57.460> about

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
but this is how what you see came about

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.210 
but this is how what you see came about
and<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.930> didn't<00:01:59.170> spend<00:01:59.320> much<00:01:59.530> time<00:01:59.560> showing<00:02:00.070> you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
and I didn't spend much time showing you

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.450 
and I didn't spend much time showing you
on<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.640> carriage<00:02:00.910> itself<00:02:01.270> because<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:03.100> are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
on the carriage itself because this are

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.070 
on the carriage itself because this are
the<00:02:03.640> saddle<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.120> guess<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.420> could<00:02:04.540> say<00:02:04.570> because

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
the saddle I guess you could say because

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.520 
the saddle I guess you could say because
you<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:06.390> use<00:02:07.390> your<00:02:07.540> imagination<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:08.290> come<00:02:08.440> up

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
you can use your imagination to come up

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.320 
you can use your imagination to come up
with<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.710> own<00:02:08.860> concept<00:02:09.460> in<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.940> am

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
with your own concept in this I am

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.300 
with your own concept in this I am
purposely<00:02:10.929> building<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.590> for<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.010> specific

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
purposely building this for a specific

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.780 
purposely building this for a specific
thing<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.650> concept<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.280> there<00:02:15.460> now<00:02:15.730> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
thing but the concept is there now you
