00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
two years ago I paid like I think like

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.250 
two years ago I paid like I think like
1200<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:33.910> at<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.180> time<00:02:34.510> because<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> had<00:02:35.019> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
1200 for at that time because it had it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800
