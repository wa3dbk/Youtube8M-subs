00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.230
 hi friends from youtube I'm Juan Flores and 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.940
 Well I came to introduce you some 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.090
 Tips to take care of the Xbox 360 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.390
 Slim brand versions of elite and but 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.940
 of 20 and this without saying good we're going to 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.580
 Start first is the most recommended 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.160
 is that they have a separate piece of furniture 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.859
 devices with high energy such as 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.690
 mini sound equipment and components 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.690
 televisions 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.810
 another thing is that it should be in a 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.600
 space away from the wall as I would 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.490
 I have come from 30 over 30 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.280
 centimeters I think until about 40 o 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.710
 something like that centimeters but it must 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.250
 be 30 centimeters from the floor 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.980
 of the wall 2000 this part must also 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.320
 be ventilated because here the air comes out 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.510
 hot here hot air comes out 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.390
 same here comes the hot air of this 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.180
 release another thing that I recommend is 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.879
 they put some soda caps that 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.890
 the bottom part since they reach you 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.720
 see the reflection has also some 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.720
 oldies that there is also the air 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.800
 hot another thing a piece of advice that has 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.170
 lasted is that please play 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 about three hours a day for them to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.280
 last the consoles that do not have a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.250
 extra fan or an intercooler 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.070
 to the console good I have it from 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.540
 2007 hopefully you will be able to see the date of 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.729
 I do not know how it's a little pink 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.619
 but well my xbox is manufactured on 30 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.159
 September 2007 that is to say it comes with the 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.670
 plate the first the first modified 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.790
 after dinner good and lasted me 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 and has lasted bought in 2000 in 2009 will 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.600
 buy the console and until now they 're 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.700
 two years and I have it well alright well another 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 thing that I recommend is that please 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.640
 if they are going to buy hard disks discs 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.560
 hard hdd away I recommend you go 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.560
 where a technician even installs it 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.019
 because there are cases that Paris will 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.410
 to install in a 20 gig version 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.560
 one of 120 is not going to ask for a firmware 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.180
 extra and that's hard to install the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.180
 another thing that I can tell you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.530
 what do I tell them to have 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.990
 always updated to your ego but that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.860
 please update it via usb 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.750
 because they exist when you connect to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.600
 like it asks for update and this 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.700
 update is just a hoax to see 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.610
 if it has tarnished or not 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.160
 sorry if you have hacked flashed to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.350
 its that 's just for that they serve 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.130
 good updates I'm going to show you 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.480
 the update of ls 3.0 that came out 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.030
 in the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.409
 on December 6 , 2011 is the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.379
 last update that has come out and 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.739
 this and this update will welcome 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.409
 the games until November 2012 and 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.090
 well I'm going to show you here we're going to 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.430
 learn the console I recommend them 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.069
 they learn well by the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.680
 control button already good 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.400
 let's see good I'm watching 'bob 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.610
 sponge 'that from here already the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.610
 console excuse between the audio 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.550
 well there is the update the 3.0 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.020
 is the update is confirmed that 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.890
 all the games that come out 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.170
 November 2011 will be compatible 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.050
 until a new update comes out 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.940
 well here is the update here the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.200
 I have let's put some music 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.910
 for activity to have the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.090
 environment comes out I feel this is for 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.620
 connect the media center 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.400
 this needs to be connected to the internet 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.980
 if you have internet, you scrubbed yourself good 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.239
 because it is the one that has scrubbed the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.290
 console with a goat something you get into 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.060
 mediacenter and in a good way you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.790
 I recommend that you do not use any of 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.459
 these big fours I recommend them 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.079
 because those directly go to the air 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.169
 all those 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.970
 also here is everything here in social 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.150
 we found our little friend the avatar 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.400
 with the games and achievements that we have 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.099
 played so far you're good 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.949
 abitab and 12 thousand tons that is from me 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:41.550
 brother call of duty of 2012 ex for two 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.340
 It is mounted with ryder cane among others 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.379
 good here this section friends 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.990
 applications sessions to start our 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.360
 receptions for live I do not know 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.990
 I recommend because or want to be 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.840
 baneados or play with luck here 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.050
 in music I'm going to show you a 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.800
 tutorial how to spend legos music with the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.340
 lg 3.0 the applications this 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.039
 I recommend that you use it but only 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.169
 green squares because if we use the 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.930
 red square is mediacenter asks us 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.099
 internet and we are already in danger of 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.979
 I already have music just now 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.139
 installed games that I have two here them 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.050
 we leave three mics installed here in 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.750
 My room floor 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.199
 installed on hard disk I have the deadly 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.960
 kombat and that life and 12 wonder about 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.650
 how few because I have on the disc 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.000
 hard of 20 measurements of the pro and good 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.940
 There is no power I have not wanted 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.620
 enlarge the hard drive because I can 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.680
 bring problems I prefer to buy a 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.569
 external hard drive and already good this day 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.050
 have with the version of kinect as wine 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:56.169
 to 2.0 storage units 20 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.860
 in the 208 megabytes of hard drive there you are 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.990
 13 3.6 giganton in games of 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.330
 applications and that's what is going to 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.819
 leave on average two games already 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.189
 good here in permission of meanings 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.080
 here are the saved games of 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.889
 all the games 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.569
 already 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:22.439
 another thing is xbox like it is the first 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.439
 modified 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.580
 already comes with the hdmi cable but the 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:31.669
 problem is that my TV does not have no 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.340
 has cable has no hdmi input and no 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:37.389
 I know why it's good but I have 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.219
 connected the blue green and red wires 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.860
 in their streets they also create the high 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:45.199
 definition and something else that 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.199
 I recommend that you turn off the controls 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.749
 when they go to see a movie or when 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:54.439
 go listen to music because the 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:57.110
 batteries since I can tell you more than the 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:59.000
 source of power I have it at the top in the 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.800
 soil because there are cases that make 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.120
 too much noise to the power source and 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.900
 we spend 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.669
 well I think it's all I'm going to 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.160
 I recommend that when they go to update 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.350
 your echoes make it for a usb device 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.650
 and I'm going to teach you the method in 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.820
 next video I will also teach you 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.710
 to pass music from a normal guy to the 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.680
 memory or to the hard disk of elected 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.380
 I will also show you how to install 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.900
 an external hard drive like that of a 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.050
 asif terabyte to work as 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.699
 memory and I'll show you a little more 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.220
 of things but the problem is not 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.680
 I have the material here, good, I wish you 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.479
 Good luck subscribe hand up 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.050
 is that they liked low hand it is not 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:49.010
 comment are free and good be happy 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.010
