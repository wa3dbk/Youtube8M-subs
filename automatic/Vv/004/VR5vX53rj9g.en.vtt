want to give it more like details behind

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.550 
want to give it more like details behind
the<00:03:11.550> scene<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.510> example<00:03:12.569> in<00:03:13.080> Minecraft

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the scene so for example in Minecraft

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.890 
the scene so for example in Minecraft
when<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.830> hit<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> mob<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.660> will<00:03:15.780> do

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
when you hit the mob like you will do

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
when you hit the mob like you will do
like<00:03:16.050> an<00:03:16.200> odd<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.590> effect<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> map<00:03:17.459> will

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
like an odd but effect so the map will

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.150 
like an odd but effect so the map will
go<00:03:17.940> back<00:03:18.180> when<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.630> hit<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.959> yep<00:03:19.260> well<00:03:20.010> it's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
go back when you hit it yep well it's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.949 
go back when you hit it yep well it's
not<00:03:20.310> like<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.549> anymore<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> chance

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
not like that anymore there is a chance

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.100 
not like that anymore there is a chance
of<00:03:22.170> doing<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.610> because<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.660> not<00:03:24.780> like

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
of doing that but because it's not like

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.930 
of doing that but because it's not like
that<00:03:25.140> all<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.530> time<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:26.070> even<00:03:26.340> harder<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
that all the time it's even harder to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.310 
that all the time it's even harder to
kill<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.209> up<00:03:27.329> because<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:27.900> you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320

cannot just spam spam click it because

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.400 
cannot just spam spam click it because
it<00:03:31.680> will<00:03:31.829> just<00:03:32.010> go<00:03:32.549> for<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:34.079> kill<00:03:34.380> you

it will just go for you and kill you
yeah<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.950> also<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:36.420> cannot<00:03:36.720> back<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> lot<00:03:37.320> as

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
than a slaughter and also for the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.120 
than a slaughter and also for the
Scorpion<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.670> example<00:03:45.320> like<00:03:46.320> all<00:03:46.560> those<00:03:46.829> mobs

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
Scorpion for example like all those mobs

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.520 
Scorpion for example like all those mobs
are<00:03:47.280> neutrals<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:48.359> won't<00:03:48.630> attack<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.230> if

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
are neutrals they won't attack you if

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.710 
are neutrals they won't attack you if
you<00:03:49.769> are<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.280> attacking<00:03:50.760> them<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.600> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
you are not attacking them but for the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.750 
you are not attacking them but for the
Scorpion<00:03:52.019> for<00:03:52.440> example<00:03:52.829> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.100> mind<00:03:53.340> they

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
Scorpion for example in the mind they

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.610 
Scorpion for example in the mind they
will<00:03:53.940> automatically<00:03:54.690> attack<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.109> if<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.500> are

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
will automatically attack you if you are

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.300 
will automatically attack you if you are
like<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.130> lower<00:03:56.609> level<00:03:58.010> was<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.250> we

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
like a lower level was it that we

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250 
like a lower level was it that we
decided<00:03:59.760> one<00:03:59.970> level<00:04:00.269> above<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.840> you'd<00:04:01.140> be

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
decided one level above it and you'd be

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.400 
decided one level above it and you'd be
able<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:02.340> get<00:04:02.549> by<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.329> now<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:04.079> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
able to not get by you now that's to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.599 
able to not get by you now that's to
fend<00:04:05.370> off<00:04:05.600> low<00:04:06.600> level<00:04:06.989> miners<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.620> make<00:04:08.430> it

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
fend off low level miners and make it

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.840 
fend off low level miners and make it
more<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.150> threat<00:04:09.690> maybe<00:04:10.440> more<00:04:11.280> mobs<00:04:11.579> will

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
more of a threat maybe more mobs will

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.300 
more of a threat maybe more mobs will
have<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.299> trait<00:04:12.780> later<00:04:13.079> on<00:04:13.350> yeah<00:04:14.040> like<00:04:14.280> I

red spider as a small poison spyder a
skeleton<00:04:42.069> another<00:04:42.669> moment<00:04:43.029> the<00:04:43.090> grizzly<00:04:43.509> bear

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599

we've<00:04:46.599> we<00:04:46.930> talked<00:04:47.259> about<00:04:47.439> this<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.550> begged

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
we've we talked about this and I begged

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.209 
we've we talked about this and I begged
skip<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.270> change<00:04:49.569> it<00:04:49.779> and<00:04:49.900> he<00:04:50.259> did<00:04:50.499> get<00:04:50.770> told<00:04:51.009> by

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
skip to change it and he did get told by

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.029 
skip to change it and he did get told by
someone<00:04:51.430> else<00:04:51.610> maybe<00:04:51.819> a<00:04:52.120> dark<00:04:53.020> brown<00:04:53.349> horse

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
someone else maybe a dark brown horse

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.040 
someone else maybe a dark brown horse
would<00:04:54.550> be<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> better<00:04:55.060> idea<00:04:55.270> for<00:04:55.599> grizzly<00:04:55.930> bear

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
would be a better idea for grizzly bear

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.200 
would be a better idea for grizzly bear
so<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.949> think<00:04:57.219> that's<00:04:57.460> going<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.699> be<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:58.029> then<00:04:58.120> I

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
so I think that's going to be and then I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.429 
so I think that's going to be and then I
said<00:04:58.479> maybe<00:04:58.689> the<00:04:58.810> Endermen<00:04:59.110> should<00:04:59.289> be<00:04:59.409> a

00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
said maybe the Endermen should be a

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.529 
said maybe the Endermen should be a
lesser<00:04:59.680> demon<00:05:00.099> and<00:05:00.279> that'd<00:05:00.909> be<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> highest

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
lesser demon and that'd be the highest

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.209 
lesser demon and that'd be the highest
level<00:05:01.870> Marvin<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.379> game<00:05:02.560> at<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.800> moment<00:05:03.159> I

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
level Marvin the game at the moment I

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.399 
level Marvin the game at the moment I
think<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:04.210> that'd<00:05:04.360> be<00:05:04.479> awesome<00:05:04.659> that<00:05:05.229> would

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
think so that'd be awesome that would

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.709 
think so that'd be awesome that would
just<00:05:05.439> be<00:05:05.710> amazing<00:05:05.889> like<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:07.150> such<00:05:07.509> an

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
just be amazing like this such an

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.230 
just be amazing like this such an
incentive<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.379> go<00:05:08.650> higher<00:05:08.889> on<00:05:09.159> this<00:05:09.279> game<00:05:09.550> that

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
incentive to go higher on this game that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.550 
incentive to go higher on this game that
wasn't<00:05:10.719> on<00:05:10.810> my<00:05:10.930> ski<00:05:11.199> one<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:13.080> also<00:05:14.080> we<00:05:14.349> can't

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
wasn't on my ski one and also we can't

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.869 
wasn't on my ski one and also we can't
show<00:05:14.740> horses<00:05:15.129> at<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.400> moment<00:05:15.669> but<00:05:15.729> they're

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
show horses at the moment but they're

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.029 
show horses at the moment but they're
obviously<00:05:16.270> in<00:05:16.449> and<00:05:16.599> there's<00:05:17.050> also<00:05:17.199> unicorns

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
obviously in and there's also unicorns

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.860 
obviously in and there's also unicorns
but<00:05:18.789> we<00:05:18.969> we<00:05:19.330> used<00:05:19.629> a<00:05:20.759> glass<00:05:21.759> box<00:05:22.270> around<00:05:22.659> them

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
but we we used a glass box around them

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.659 
but we we used a glass box around them
and<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.379> had<00:05:23.529> a<00:05:23.560> texture<00:05:23.919> pack<00:05:24.069> on<00:05:24.250> so<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.580> I

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
and I had a texture pack on so that I

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.480 
and I had a texture pack on so that I
can't<00:05:24.909> see<00:05:25.089> the<00:05:25.210> class<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.889> yeah<00:05:27.310> there's

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490
