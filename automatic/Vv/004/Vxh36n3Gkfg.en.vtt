00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the back of the net so it was good to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
championship tournament I know

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
championship tournament I know
Bundesliga<00:01:29.790> science<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> guess

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Bundesliga science because I guess

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
Bundesliga science because I guess
people<00:01:31.290> play<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> other<00:01:32.549> channel<00:01:32.939> most

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
people play in the other channel most

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.700 
people play in the other channel most
likely<00:01:33.540> also<00:01:33.720> play<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> championship

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
likely also play in the championship

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
likely also play in the championship
tournament<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.610> face<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> Bundesliga

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
tournament so we face the Bundesliga

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
tournament so we face the Bundesliga
squad<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> am<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.310> me<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.549> usual<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
squad and am you just know me as usual I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
squad and am you just know me as usual I
just<00:01:39.720> never<00:01:39.840> liked<00:01:40.140> coming<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.560> against<00:01:40.950> them

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
just never liked coming up against them

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
just never liked coming up against them
but<00:01:41.340> we'll<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.329> very<00:01:42.540> early

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
but we'll make a one little very early

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
but we'll make a one little very early
on<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> few<00:01:43.560> minutes<00:01:43.740> later<00:01:44.009> we'll<00:01:44.220> break

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
on and a few minutes later we'll break

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.999 
on and a few minutes later we'll break
through<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> make<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.990> nil<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> very

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
through and make it to nil so a very

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
through and make it to nil so a very
good<00:01:47.280> start<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> game<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> did<00:01:48.899> not

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
good start to the game and it did not

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
good start to the game and it did not
end<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.770> play<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> three<00:01:50.340> minutes<00:01:50.700> more

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
end there we play the three minutes more

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.910 
end there we play the three minutes more
and<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.210> break<00:01:51.450> through<00:01:51.630> aquarelle<00:01:52.259> which

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and we break through aquarelle which

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
and we break through aquarelle which
drive<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> scoop<00:01:54.090> chip<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> terrible

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
drive for the scoop chip a terrible

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
drive for the scoop chip a terrible
scoop<00:01:55.140> chip<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.530> somehow<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> rebound

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
scoop chip but somehow the rebound

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
scoop chip but somehow the rebound
forced<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> water<00:01:57.299> son<00:01:57.570> who<00:01:57.659> will<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
forced to water son who will make it a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
forced to water son who will make it a
free<00:01:58.649> meal<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.360> lead

that is trapped on the board for track

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
that is trapped on the board for track

where Indian tried to get a shot in and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.900 
where Indian tried to get a shot in and
bought<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.649> goes<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.220> too<00:02:08.250> narrow<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> he

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
bought there goes way too narrow and he

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
bought there goes way too narrow and he
would<00:02:09.030> save<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> falls<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
would save that one but it falls to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.090 
would save that one but it falls to
Fernand<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.700> he<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.180> turn<00:02:12.390> around<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
Fernand in you he will turn around and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.640 
Fernand in you he will turn around and
get<00:02:13.430> into<00:02:13.820> position<00:02:13.850> for<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.750> shot<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.500> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
is off target and straight after that he

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
is off target and straight after that he
did<00:02:18.950> decide<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.430> post<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.090> game<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.720> quit<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
look at that shot from right into the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.870 
look at that shot from right into the
far<00:02:51.350> corner<00:02:51.380> nothing<00:02:52.070> my<00:02:52.190> keeper<00:02:52.520> could<00:02:52.640> do

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
far corner nothing my keeper could do

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.270 
far corner nothing my keeper could do
and<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.300> was<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.600> beautiful<00:02:53.990> shot<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.680> it

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and that was a beautiful shot and it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.070 
and that was a beautiful shot and it
makes<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:56.000> nil<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.240> my<00:02:56.510> opponent<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.020> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
makes it to nil to my opponent in the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.410 
makes it to nil to my opponent in the
15th<00:02:57.800> minute<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.670> looking<00:02:58.970> too<00:02:59.390> good

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
15th minute so not looking too good

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.060 
15th minute so not looking too good
there<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.050> eventually<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.470> would<00:03:00.650> create<00:03:01.010> a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
there but eventually I would create a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.860 
there but eventually I would create a
few<00:03:01.250> chances<00:03:01.550> could<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.090> hit<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.300> target<00:03:02.780> in

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
few chances could not hit the target in

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.990 
few chances could not hit the target in
a<00:03:02.930> grill<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.680> few<00:03:03.860> minutes<00:03:04.040> later<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.850> got

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
a grill and a few minutes later we got

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.400

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
goals he got early on and I decided to

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.450 
goals he got early on and I decided to
change<00:03:17.090> things<00:03:17.240> around<00:03:17.630> because<00:03:18.200> 442<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.430> a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
change things around because 442 is a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.450 
change things around because 442 is a
good<00:03:19.700> formation<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.660> 4<00:03:20.930> 12<00:03:21.320> 12<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.890> still<00:03:22.130> my

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
good formation but a 4 12 12 is still my

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.950 
good formation but a 4 12 12 is still my
favorite<00:03:22.490> formation<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.540> feel<00:03:23.780> most

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
favorite formation and I feel most

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.990 
favorite formation and I feel most
comfortable<00:03:24.290> playing<00:03:24.830> with<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.430> we
