00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:17.239
 so we go once the sentence the 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.239
 best white and red wine 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.870
 everything is for sale but of something yes 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.970
 I'm sure it 's an error 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.760
 it is unfortunate that the mythical is consumed 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.710
 neither did white wine the truth is 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.599
 learning from its excellent flavors and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.599
 aromas because this is the best 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.660
 the white wine besides being a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.449
 excellent appetizer is an unconditional 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.800
 allied for the hot months and this 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.260
 can be made from grapes 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 white or red so the difference with 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.100
 the red wines is that it takes or 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.829
 Grape peel has no contact with 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.239
 the must at the time of verification 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.159
 another time we will talk about how 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.780
 elaborates today we are going to focus on the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.460
 reasons why it's worth 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.760

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.160
 drink it they are fresh and radiant 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.900
 if the acidity contained in the wines 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.490
 whites and when they are due to 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.280
 correct temperature that can vary 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.420
 between 12 and 5 degrees centigrade 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.400
 depending on the strain and complexity of the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.010
 they will wrap us in a halo of 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.030
 freshness and pleasure 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.460
 imagine drinking a glass of wine 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.800
 white on a hot afternoon sitting on 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.740
 a terrace accompanied by the girl or 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.350
 boy of your dreams how they look like 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.240
 too acids please is lack of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.100
 custom do not tell me micheladas 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.380
 that you come with exorbitant amounts 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.840
 of lemon are not acidic 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.640
 the Mexicans to everything we add lemon 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.979
 then the nap is something that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.840
 we appreciate and enjoy only that in the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.850
 White wines is more subtle and elegant 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.729
 that is all 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.469
 They go very well with seafood and fish 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.479
 the beer and its cocktail called michelada 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.950
 It is a refreshing and delicious drink 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.740
 that goes well with all the fruits of the sea 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.060
 we do not discuss that but we challenge you to 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.729

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.830
 we respect those who drink red wines 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.510
 with options or prawns but it's like 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.660
 however, choose a wine that is not the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.670

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.260

 different from each other 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.420
