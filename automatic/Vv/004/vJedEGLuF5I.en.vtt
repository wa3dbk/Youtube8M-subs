00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.410
 Hi, I want to present this master's degree in 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.000
 project management and leadership 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.920
 cultural 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.660
 this is a very interesting master in 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.420
 everything regarding the field of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.180
 culture since it is not aimed at a 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.300
 only aspect of bone 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.880
 of theater dance but to others 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.560
 multiple aspects that can lead to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 for example museums 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 in international projects 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.190
 cultural cooperation and so on and so on and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 it's called management and leadership of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 cultural projects since we do 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.890
 much emphasis on the techniques of 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 differentiation of the three main 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.430
 roles that one must take into account to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 the time to carry out a project 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.559
 this is first the role of the leader the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.950
 leader is a has a particularity of 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.980
 particularity as 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.400
 it is said that you do not believe that the leader is 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.800
 innate that is some characteristics without 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.140
 However, there are some techniques that 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.590
 allow you to delve and take out aspects of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.930
 leadership we may need in a 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 determined moment the leader is everything 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 one who 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.460
 has a mission a long-term view 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.660
 who knows where he has to go and take 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 the team behind and yet there are others 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.240
 roles that are equally important 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 to take forward a project as they are 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.440
 the manager a good manager who 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 supports ideas and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.070
 designs that the leader himself has already made 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 is able to carry out those put in 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.210
 practice using all the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.630
 new technologies tools 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.830
 remains 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.890
 computer science and tics nowadays and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.959
 that we have all the tools here 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.170
 at the university rey ​​juan carlos for 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.130

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.849
 also this master since it uses all 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.800
 the computer tools brings together all 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.060
 a series of fields that are around 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.400
 directed to places where people who 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.910
 they already have a great experience inside 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.950

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.350
 situations that have already happened to 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.050
 other people and take advantage of things 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.560
 good things that have happened and avoid the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.170
 mistakes that is what usually happens 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.160
 occasions all teachers speak in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.709

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.990
 these aspects of a specific language 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.720
