00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.520
 People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in it by James Baldwin 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.940
 This is NES 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 This is the first impression of most people on Nintendo. 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.000
 This is also the first home machine of Nintendo. People who lived in that era probably can easily recognize it. 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.360
 "Nintendo" 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 "呃....Nintendo NES" 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.140
 But in October 1993, Nintendo released a host, but surprisingly.. not many people know it. 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.400
 "Imperial version of Nintendo"...Yes 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.600
 I don't know if this is 啥

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.120
 What is this host.. and why it is not known to the public. This is the story of this gaming history 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.500
 Game secrets 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.560
 Speaker: Norman Caruso 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.980
 NES2 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.480
 NES brings the game revolution and revitalizes the home game market 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.120
 The unique control handle that I have never seen before in N has brought it an amazing gaming experience. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.520
 Nintendo finally sold 60 million units. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.780
 Today is still the best one sold in Nintendo home consoles. 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.120
 Even if you join the SONY family, it is the third best model to sell. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.020
 Then in 1991, the old version of the US version was over. 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.480
 The 16-bit host generation has arrived, and the NES system looks like an old clock at this time. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.540
 However, many people still like the past Nintendo (referred to as NES) because he is cheaper than super. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.460
 And also has more than 800 software groups 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.420
 In 1993, Nintendo created the final tribute to his first host, and in October he sold NES2. 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.040
 NES2 is best known to use the upper loading cassette 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.580
 This was designed by Lance Barr, the host designer of NES and SNES. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.600
 Barr claims that the appearance of the square is outdated, I think it is time to change to a smoother and more attractive appearance. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960
 And Barr is definitely right. 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.480
 Comparing these two new and old versions, the NES2 is smaller and lighter than the NES. 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.260
 The power switch is similar to SNES, you can simply turn on the power by pressing the button 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.000
 The host has two controller slots just like the prototype. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.920
 In the past, the old surroundings, like light guns and gold finger cards, can also operate normally. 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.780
 Although some players will complain that the golden finger sometimes has problems, the original author of the golden finger card, Galoob, has quickly released the correction file to solve the problem. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 However, the controller adopts a new design, and he is closer to a super handle like a dog bone shape. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.600
 The biggest and most obvious improvement is that the cassette socket is changed to the top of the host. 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.900
 Do you remember to blow the cartridge first every time you plug the game into the mainframe and press the cassette repeatedly to make the damn reading light flash? 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.280
 This is due to the design flaw of the original NES. 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.540
 When you press the cassette, the metal pins of the game will bend over time and the metal will be damaged. 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.400
 This will result in poor contact, making it impossible to read NES 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.020
 The new version of the NES does not have this problem, the cassette can be inserted as firmly as the super 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.440
 Although it has a problem that it is too tight to be pulled out 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.060
 This host sounds very good, it should be a big sale. 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.120
 But unfortunately it didn't, the model was discontinued within a year, and the last game of NES was released in 1994. 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.780
 What happened in the end?? 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:32.240
 Um..... As far as this host is concerned, there are some drawbacks for beginners. For example, if the AV terminal is not attached, you can only use the past RF terminal. 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940
 Second, there is no LED light display 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.040
 I have already forgotten it several times, and the host is still working. 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.900
 Another problem is that Nintendo used to require horizontal insertion and locking. 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.540
 Therefore, some game cartridges may cause shaking and distortion 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.320
 This will cause some noticeable but unclear lines on the screen. 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.360
 The serial number is also removed. 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.280
 However, the biggest reason for the decline of NES2 is that he only started selling at the end of the NES host life. 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.060
 The 16-bit generation has arrived, and most of the players have already moved to the new console. 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.120
 Despite its flaws, NES2 is still my first choice for playing NES games. 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.720
 Very simple.. because his execution is very stable 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.420
 And he is also small and will not occupy the space of the cabinet. 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.160
 At the time, the price of this thing was $49.99. 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.580
 Cheaper than the current XBOX360 game 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.160
 And now you can buy it on ebay for about $70-150. 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.900
 But I bought the console +66 games for $40. 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.680
 And my friend bought the console +25 games for $10 in the flea market. 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.860
 So don't give up hope, maybe there are NES2 waiting for you there. 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.000
 If you are lucky enough to get one, he is a very valuable and highly valued collection. 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.420
 Ok.. Let’s review the contents of this chapter now. 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.980
 Today we learned that in 1993, Nintendo released a new version of the redesigned NES. 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.700
 This host is lighter and smaller, and has a new version of the controller 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.360
 The cassette is also changed to the top insert 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.460
 However, the host lacks the AV terminal and the LED light, and the image often shows some lines. 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.180
 The host will be discontinued soon after the release, and the NES host life will end. 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.060
 In short... this is the game’s secret story this week. 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.500
