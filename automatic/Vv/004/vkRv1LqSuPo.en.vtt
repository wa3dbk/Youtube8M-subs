now<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.109> big<00:00:19.380> position<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
now the big position that we want to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.400 
now the big position that we want to
talk<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.539> Xel'Naga<00:00:21.960> towers

control these days L Naga towers is so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
control these days L Naga towers is so
important<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.439> main<00:00:25.590> reason<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
important the main reason is because it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
important the main reason is because it
gives<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.390> access<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> natural<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
gives you access to the natural and the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
gives you access to the natural and the
third<00:00:29.070> base<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.580> players<00:00:30.269> could<00:00:30.539> set<00:00:30.840> up

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
third base now players could set up

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.650 
third base now players could set up
right<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.529> yes<00:00:32.090> but<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.270> fact<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
right here yes but the fact of the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.130 
right here yes but the fact of the
matter<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:35.399> very<00:00:36.140> defensive

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
matter is they are very very defensive

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
matter is they are very very defensive
and<00:00:37.260> they're<00:00:37.649> contained<00:00:38.129> semi<00:00:38.579> contain<00:00:39.030> it's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and they're contained semi contain it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560 
and they're contained semi contain it's
hard<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.140> around<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.829> force<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.510> try<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
hard to go around this force and try to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
hard to go around this force and try to
put<00:00:43.140> pressure<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.649> opponent<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.210> if<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
put pressure on your opponent so if you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
tower what that basically enables you to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
tower what that basically enables you to
do<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> expand<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.870> above<00:00:51.870> three<00:00:52.320> bases<00:00:53.329> now

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
do is expand up above three bases now

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
do is expand up above three bases now
the<00:00:54.360> problem<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.840> taking<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> Xel'Naga

the problem with taking the Xel'Naga
tower<00:00:56.219> too<00:00:56.579> fast<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tower too fast is that you don't want to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
tower too fast is that you don't want to
take<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.579> leave<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.420> guess

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
take this and then leave your I guess

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.130 
take this and then leave your I guess
your<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.550> main<00:01:02.820> very<00:01:03.629> exposed
