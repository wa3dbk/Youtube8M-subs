00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
that just randomly placed in that's how

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.870 
that just randomly placed in that's how
they<00:03:24.920> get<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.100> purple<00:03:25.340> jam<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:25.670> just

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.640 
they get the purple jam you just
randomly<00:03:26.180> jump<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.600> them<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.870> then<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.230> tasted

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
randomly jump on them and then it tasted

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.830 
randomly jump on them and then it tasted
the<00:03:27.709> purple<00:03:27.980> gem<00:03:28.130> area<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.390> know<00:03:29.540> because

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the purple gem area and you know because

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.610 
the purple gem area and you know because
they're<00:03:29.989> not<00:03:30.109> moving<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:31.570> don't<00:03:32.570> know<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:33.019> no

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
they're not moving I don't know it's no

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.199 
they're not moving I don't know it's no
you<00:03:33.680> don't<00:03:33.950> put<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.160> randomly<00:03:34.760> in<00:03:35.000> their

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
you don't put that randomly in their

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.640 
you don't put that randomly in their
psyche<00:03:35.570> one<00:03:35.780> that's<00:03:36.230> probably<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> most

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
psyche one that's probably the most

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.580 
psyche one that's probably the most
random<00:03:37.010> warp<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.430> whole<00:03:37.640> game<00:03:38.079> some<00:03:39.079> some

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
random warp in the whole game some some

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.690 
random warp in the whole game some some
of<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.739> more<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:42.170> kind<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.620> obvious<00:03:42.769> cuz<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
of the more it's kind of obvious cuz the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.009 
of the more it's kind of obvious cuz the
nitrous<00:03:44.030> aren't<00:03:44.239> moving<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.660> stuff<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.959> I

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
nitrous aren't moving the stuff and I

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.080 
nitrous aren't moving the stuff and I
don't<00:03:45.319> know<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.530> no<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:45.859> not<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.310> probably

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
don't know it no it's not it probably

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.300 
don't know it no it's not it probably
isn't<00:03:47.180> possible<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:47.840> nor<00:03:48.470> do<00:03:48.650> dog<00:03:48.949> just<00:03:49.130> put

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
isn't possible but nor do dog just put

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.370 
isn't possible but nor do dog just put
that<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.609> there<00:03:49.790> it's<00:03:50.329> just<00:03:50.540> random<00:03:50.870> that's

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
that in there it's just random that's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.300 
that in there it's just random that's
all<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.620> is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
all it is

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
I see yes you see ok now I'm probably

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.260 
I see yes you see ok now I'm probably
dying<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.890> lot<00:03:58.640> more<00:03:58.819> necessary<00:03:59.060> than<00:03:59.510> um<00:04:00.040> then

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
dying a lot more necessary than um then

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.820 
dying a lot more necessary than um then
get<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.300> lot<00:04:02.540> more<00:04:02.569> than<00:04:03.080> necessary<00:04:03.790> yes<00:04:05.830> I'm

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830

get a lot more than necessary yes I'm
just<00:04:07.520> tied<00:04:07.880> again<00:04:08.230> yes<00:04:10.090> yes<00:04:11.090> yes<00:04:11.150> yes<00:04:11.599> because

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
just tied again yes yes yes yes because

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
just tied again yes yes yes yes because
last<00:04:12.470> part<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:13.700> was<00:04:13.819> actually<00:04:14.030> generally

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
last part that was actually generally

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.140 
last part that was actually generally
hard<00:04:14.870> part<00:04:15.230> so<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> can<00:04:16.639> actually<00:04:16.790> die

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
hard part so you know I can actually die

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:27.690 
hard part so you know I can actually die
then<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.750> part<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.230> just<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.590> easy

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.270 

yeah<00:04:28.700> yeah<00:04:29.389> oh<00:04:29.690> no<00:04:30.290> ain't<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.800> hard<00:04:31.070> it's

I<00:04:34.280> didn't<00:04:34.820> control<00:04:35.180> my<00:04:35.300> d-pad<00:04:35.660> properly<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.200> to

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
I didn't control my d-pad properly so to

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:44.890 
I didn't control my d-pad properly so to
my<00:04:36.979> fault<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:41.180> can't<00:04:41.360> really<00:04:41.600> see<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:43.900> did

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
my fault you can't really see this did

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.120 
my fault you can't really see this did
you<00:04:44.990> see<00:04:45.110> this<00:04:45.200> nitrous<00:04:45.590> back<00:04:45.800> there<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.070> I

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
you see this nitrous back there that I

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.690 
you see this nitrous back there that I
just<00:04:46.340> don't<00:04:46.639> wish<00:04:46.880> Matt<00:04:47.150> madly<00:04:47.750> Josh<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:49.490> did

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
just don't wish Matt madly Josh you did

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.390 
just don't wish Matt madly Josh you did
okay<00:04:50.000> good<00:04:50.180> okay<00:04:51.050> yeah<00:04:51.320> well<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:51.770> some<00:04:52.130> reason

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
okay good okay yeah well but some reason

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.280 
okay good okay yeah well but some reason
I<00:04:52.460> find<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:52.729> level<00:04:53.030> much<00:04:53.270> much<00:04:53.479> easier<00:04:53.510> to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
I find this level much much easier to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.350 
I find this level much much easier to
complete<00:04:54.500> them<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> our<00:04:54.979> last<00:04:55.280> one<00:04:55.490> even<00:04:56.240> if

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
complete them the our last one even if

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.710 
complete them the our last one even if
even<00:04:56.539> if<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:57.190> ya<00:04:58.190> know<00:04:58.550> even<00:04:59.000> even<00:04:59.180> if<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.600> is

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
even if it ya know even even if it is

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.000 
even if it ya know even even if it is
just<00:04:59.750> for<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.169> crystal<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.560> find<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.919> easier

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
just for the crystal I find it easier

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.800 
just for the crystal I find it easier
this<00:05:01.340> level<00:05:01.640> than<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.240> other<00:05:02.360> one<00:05:02.539> even

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
this level than the other one even

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.040 
this level than the other one even
though<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.169> later<00:05:03.410> level<00:05:07.030> nope<00:05:08.050> nope

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.110 
assignment death threat it's just a warp
it<00:05:20.750> makes<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.050> even<00:05:21.289> more<00:05:21.440> easier<00:05:21.979> that's<00:05:22.940> what
