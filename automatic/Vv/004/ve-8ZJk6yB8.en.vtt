 man for these purposes from the federal

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.500
 rubles

 approximately 25 total 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 billion rubles first of all they 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 deal with interest subsidies 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.120

 transport and special equipment by our 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.160
 federal structures and of course 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.860
 money should be allocated only to 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 purchase of equipment which is collected on 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.650
 the territory of our country all these measures 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:08.120
 must in aggregate 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.420
 stim feast market decline decline 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.920
 production volumes the market will decline by 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.330
 in relation to 14 years by about 245 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.490
 the situation is developing it unfortunately not 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.070
 became better she became more complex 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.160
 least we need to answer all 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.870
 recent problems 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.720
 few years farming 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.000
 shows a good pace of development 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.150
 situation with the presence of technology with fuel 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.490
 mineral fertilizers with financial 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 it is also a good resource as a whole and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.350
 that's what 's the problem with mineral 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.990
 fertilizer the difference between domestic and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.330
 external price will average 20-30 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.010
 percent to regions are listed from 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.620
 federal budget over a hundred and eight 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.350
 billion rubles for regional 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 authorities in the whole country brought to 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.620
 so you about 20 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.360
 billion rubles 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.370
 average cost of motor fuel 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.830
 grew up in relation to January 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 it is of course additional financial 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.400
 load on our 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.130
 agricultural producers understand that 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.040
 such a test its obvious economic 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.170
 interests of fuel producers 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.400
 impossible to reason like that something wrong 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.810
 always chocolate i'm all the rest of them 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.310
 are dependent on a colleague 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.150
 which is zero or 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.640
 near-zero 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.860
 let's act differently then we just 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.620
 we will have to say that in failure 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.470
 agricultural work is to blame for those who are not 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.989
 distributed money from all proletarian 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.950
 straightforward let's decide everything 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.560
 organizational 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.110
 it was rightly said that one day 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.239
 feeds then the whole year becoming 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.540
 business in our country has not always gone in 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.900
 framework of legal field 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.820
 laws often changed 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.820
 today in terms of legal 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.630
 stability 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.840
 predictability should be allowed 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.700
 report to people calmly and openly 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 funds in essence thereby help 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.170
 fix previous mistakes new 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.510
 the law allows you to create a legal framework 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.560
 involvement in the economy of property which 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.060
 was 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.459
 the so-called gray zone and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.989
 re-register this property on her 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.140
 actual owners 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.330
 for the legalization of such property which 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.020
 previously hiding will need to file 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.610
 special tax return 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.740
 you can register any 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.070
 property which is currently 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.110
 is in nominal possession 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.300
 the owner and control and 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.770
 foreign companies and accounts in 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.130
 corresponding banks deadline 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.250
 filing such a declaration on December 31st 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.250
 of the year
