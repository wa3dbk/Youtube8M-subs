just<00:00:35.250> started<00:00:35.550> last<00:00:35.790> week<00:00:36.920> notice<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.070> they

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.299 
didn't use the new United signing which
leads<00:00:40.170> me<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> believe<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.219> even
