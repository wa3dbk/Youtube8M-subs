 To fill cracks in the wall, or simple holes left by screws or nails, it is necessary to use stucco 

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:28.671
 a white, dense and mellow material that dries in contact with air 

00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:46.021
 Before proceeding we clean the crack or the small hole, because often the margins tend to crumble easily 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.379
 using a spatula or a small scraper then gently remove the parts of the edge that are not well bonded to the wall 

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:19.192
 then with the help of a small broom or vacuum cleaner, we remove the dust that will have been created on the wall 

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:34.915
 Using a flexible spatula, take small quantities of putty from the jar, insert it in the crack and level the wall with the spatula 

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:59.040
 if the crack or the hole is very deep we will have to repeat this operation a few times, always using small amounts of putty 

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.620
 When the crack seems well filled we wait for the filler to dry completely 

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:38.590
 then we sand the wall, trying to perfectly level the stucco part with the wall on the sides
