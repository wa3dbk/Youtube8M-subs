I've<00:00:03.229> always<00:00:03.469> believed<00:00:03.919> the<00:00:04.040> best<00:00:04.250> wines<00:00:04.520> were

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
I've always believed the best wines were

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.880 
I've always believed the best wines were
made<00:00:05.299> on<00:00:05.480> the<00:00:05.600> edge<00:00:05.750> but<00:00:06.140> for<00:00:06.410> the<00:00:06.500> cultural

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
edge and in the cellar I've worked with

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.830 
edge and in the cellar I've worked with
a<00:00:10.040> lot<00:00:10.400> of<00:00:10.639> great<00:00:10.940> wine<00:00:11.150> makers<00:00:11.509> from<00:00:11.599> around

and we will not compromise that for

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.180 
and we will not compromise that for
anything

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.620 

this<00:00:43.190> is<00:00:43.340> one<00:00:43.490> of<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.670> busiest<00:00:43.790> times<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.360> year

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
this is one of the busiest times of year

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.510 
this is one of the busiest times of year
it's<00:00:44.870> spring<00:00:45.290> time<00:00:45.320> as<00:00:45.710> you<00:00:45.800> can<00:00:45.950> see<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.310> legs

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
it's spring time as you can see the legs

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.250 
it's spring time as you can see the legs
are<00:00:46.670> still<00:00:46.910> white<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.900> is<00:00:48.050> where<00:00:48.200> all

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
are still white and this is where all

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.160 
are still white and this is where all
the<00:00:48.440> pruning<00:00:48.800> starts<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.340> happen<00:00:49.960> now<00:00:50.960> we've

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the pruning starts to happen now we've

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.630 
the pruning starts to happen now we've
got<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.410> get<00:00:51.470> rid<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.680> all<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.190> last<00:00:52.370> year's

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
got to get rid of all of last year's

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.160 
got to get rid of all of last year's
would<00:00:52.850> because<00:00:53.180> if<00:00:53.300> we<00:00:53.390> don't<00:00:53.660> we're<00:00:53.990> going<00:00:54.110> to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
would because if we don't we're going to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.630 
would because if we don't we're going to
have<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> jungle<00:00:54.740> in<00:00:54.890> here<00:00:54.920> we<00:00:55.250> could<00:00:55.370> have<00:00:55.490> way

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
have a jungle in here we could have way

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700 
have a jungle in here we could have way
too<00:00:55.700> many<00:00:55.970> grapes<00:00:56.210> they<00:00:56.630> won't<00:00:56.840> ripen<00:00:57.080> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
too many grapes they won't ripen and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.500 
too many grapes they won't ripen and
we'll<00:00:57.980> have<00:00:58.100> huge<00:00:58.430> disease<00:00:58.790> issues<00:00:58.970> so<00:00:59.360> this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
we'll have huge disease issues so this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.930 
we'll have huge disease issues so this
is<00:00:59.660> this<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.140> big<00:01:00.440> big<00:01:00.650> push<00:01:00.890> right<00:01:01.040> now<00:01:01.160> when

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
is this is a big big push right now when

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.550 
is this is a big big push right now when
you<00:01:02.120> aiming<00:01:02.480> for<00:01:02.690> greatness<00:01:02.900> it's<00:01:03.350> those

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
you aiming for greatness it's those

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.290 
you aiming for greatness it's those
small<00:01:03.770> cuts<00:01:04.190> at<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.489> end<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> makes<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.120> big

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
small cuts at the end that makes a big

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.320 
small cuts at the end that makes a big
difference<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.930> lot<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.860> what<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:07.340> do<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.880> manual

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
difference a lot of what we do is manual

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.180 
difference a lot of what we do is manual
them<00:01:08.480> by<00:01:08.660> hand<00:01:08.990> having<00:01:09.590> some<00:01:09.800> mechanized

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
them by hand having some mechanized

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.810 
them by hand having some mechanized
pieces<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.820> fantastic<00:01:11.480> if<00:01:11.930> used<00:01:12.470> correctly

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
pieces is fantastic if used correctly

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.880 
pieces is fantastic if used correctly
but<00:01:13.820> ultimately<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.020> tension<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:15.500> detail

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
but ultimately the tension to detail

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.770 
but ultimately the tension to detail
comes<00:01:16.220> from<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.910> hands-on<00:01:17.270> approach

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.810 

they<00:01:20.320> had<00:01:20.470> traveled<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> world<00:01:21.040> looking<00:01:21.400> at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
they had traveled the world looking at

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.240 
they had traveled the world looking at
soils<00:01:22.240> looking<00:01:22.659> at<00:01:22.780> some<00:01:23.200> weather<00:01:23.770> patterns

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
soils looking at some weather patterns

soils looking at some weather patterns
and<00:01:24.700> temperatures<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.950> with<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.490> vision

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
and temperatures and all with the vision

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.330 
and temperatures and all with the vision
of<00:01:28.030> producing<00:01:28.900> wines<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.650> resemble<00:01:30.130> as

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
of producing wines that resemble as

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.160 
of producing wines that resemble as
close<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.119> Chardonnay<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.509> Pinot<00:01:31.810> is

close to the Chardonnay and Pinot is

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.800 
close to the Chardonnay and Pinot is
from<00:01:32.320> burgundy<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:34.119> regions<00:01:34.390> that

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
from burgundy and the two regions that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.800 
from burgundy and the two regions that

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
allow me to do it our Niagara and then

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.580 
allow me to do it our Niagara and then

I'm just meeting with Phil check on up
you<00:01:46.659> know<00:01:47.130> Chardonnay<00:01:48.130> sites<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.610> our<00:01:48.700> recent

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you know Chardonnay sites and our recent

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.870 
you know Chardonnay sites and our recent
sites<00:01:49.330> should<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.259> down<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.280> about<00:01:51.430> 23<00:01:51.850> hours

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
sites should be down the about 23 hours

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.570 
sites should be down the about 23 hours
of<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.509> then<00:01:52.630> you'll<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.679> 334<00:01:59.580> we're
