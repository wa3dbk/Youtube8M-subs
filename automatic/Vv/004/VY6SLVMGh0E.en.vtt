with a bike with a quick-release and
then<00:03:14.330> later<00:03:14.570> upgrade<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> wheel<00:03:15.500> set<00:03:15.800> that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
then later upgrade to a wheel set that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.400 
then later upgrade to a wheel set that
