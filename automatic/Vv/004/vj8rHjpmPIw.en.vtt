over<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.119> general<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.659> seems<00:01:44.690> like<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.259> a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
over on general it seems like it's a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.590

little bit more in a white color than
what<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.899> would<00:01:48.080> get<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.770> under<00:01:49.310> four<00:01:49.459> three

jellybean<00:01:50.330> which<00:01:51.099> with<00:01:52.099> some<00:01:52.129> things<00:01:52.580> touch

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
jellybean which with some things touch

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.969 
jellybean which with some things touch
with<00:01:53.209> so<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.959> can<00:01:54.080> definitely<00:01:54.170> be<00:01:54.470> something

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
with so that can definitely be something

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.619 
with so that can definitely be something
that<00:01:55.160> that's<00:01:55.910> probably<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.420> more

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:56.629 
that that's probably the more

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.410 
that that's probably the more
interesting<00:01:57.440> thing<00:01:57.950> here<00:01:58.310> about<00:01:58.879> this<00:01:59.270> little

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.150 
still be the same kind of thing here I'm
for<00:02:16.970> sure<00:02:17.269> hmm<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:18.080> gonna<00:02:18.230> drag<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.800> down<00:02:18.950> like

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
for sure hmm I'm gonna drag it down like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.369 
for sure hmm I'm gonna drag it down like
this<00:02:19.340> maybe<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.120> see<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:21.019> seems<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
this maybe you can see that it seems to

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.240 
this maybe you can see that it seems to
be<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.680> bit<00:02:21.830> more<00:02:22.099> maybe<00:02:22.280> transparent

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
be a little bit more maybe transparent

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:47.780 
be a little bit more maybe transparent
perhaps<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.940> maybe<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.450> miss<00:02:26.660> guessing

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.809 

okay<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:48.659> what<00:02:49.439> is<00:02:49.560> more<00:02:49.830> new<00:02:50.069> in<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.580> little

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
okay so what is more new in this little

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.210 
okay so what is more new in this little
update<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.840> seems<00:02:52.079> like<00:02:52.290> they've<00:02:52.470> updated<00:02:52.799> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
update it seems like they've updated the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.449 
update it seems like they've updated the
landscape<00:02:53.730> keyboard<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.079> we<00:02:55.680> would<00:02:55.920> go<00:02:56.129> in

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
landscape keyboard so if we would go in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.339 
landscape keyboard so if we would go in
into<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> typing<00:02:57.750> mode<00:02:57.930> here<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.780> we<00:03:00.780> do<00:03:01.019> have

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
into a typing mode here and we do have

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.309 
into a typing mode here and we do have
the<00:03:01.500> keyboard<00:03:01.739> here<00:03:02.360> let's<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.450> try<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
the keyboard here let's just try the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.330 
the keyboard here let's just try the
landscape<00:03:04.709> mode<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:06.590> you'll<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.799> able<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.099> see

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
landscape mode and you'll be able to see

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.530 
landscape mode and you'll be able to see
how<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.940> looks<00:03:09.239> over<00:03:09.659> here<00:03:11.299> from<00:03:12.299> what<00:03:12.450> I've

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
how it looks over here from what I've

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.819 
how it looks over here from what I've
heard<00:03:12.569> should<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> little<00:03:13.530> bit<00:03:13.620> more

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
heard should be a little bit more

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.420 
heard should be a little bit more
compact<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.590> could<00:03:16.709> happen<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.099> be<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
compact so that could happen to be and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.619 
compact so that could happen to be and
nicely<00:03:18.090> update<00:03:18.510> there<00:03:19.519> some<00:03:20.519> other<00:03:20.760> additions

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
nicely update there some other additions

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.869 
nicely update there some other additions
here<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:24.230> hello<00:03:25.230> see<00:03:25.500> her<00:03:25.709> yeah<00:03:26.099> overall<00:03:26.639> it

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
here is hello see her yeah overall it

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.000 
here is hello see her yeah overall it
should<00:03:26.940> definitely<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:28.170> performance

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
should definitely be a a performance

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.440 
should definitely be a a performance
boost<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:31.250> compared<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.430> compared<00:03:33.389> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
boost and in compared to compared to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.649 
boost and in compared to compared to
earlier<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.319> definitely<00:03:35.069> do<00:03:35.220> see<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:36.269> I

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
earlier I definitely do see that when I

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.020 
earlier I definitely do see that when I
am<00:03:36.959> putting<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.500> device<00:03:37.799> down<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.489> booting

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
am putting the device down and booting

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.640 
am putting the device down and booting
it<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.540> terms<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.609> N<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.409> kind<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it up in terms of the N the it kind of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.250 
it up in terms of the N the it kind of
feels<00:03:43.859> like<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.040> animation<00:03:44.840> overall<00:03:45.840> slow

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
feels like the animation overall slow

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.379 
feels like the animation overall slow
bit<00:03:46.409> quicker

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.479 

again<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:52.230> additions<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.769> really<00:03:53.069> changed

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
again the additions have really changed

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.089 
again the additions have really changed
that<00:03:53.669> much<00:03:54.139> there<00:03:55.139> probably<00:03:55.290> many<00:03:55.620> many<00:03:55.799> many

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
that much there probably many many many

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.390 
that much there probably many many many
small<00:03:56.459> tweaks<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.510> terms<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.500> system<00:03:58.889> and

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
small tweaks in terms of the system and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.860 
small tweaks in terms of the system and
