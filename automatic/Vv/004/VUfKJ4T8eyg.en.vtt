00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.889
 We will now learn to work with 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.410
 music and clip we clips are symbols 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.550

 online independent running on 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.420
 independent of the main time line 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960
 So we're going to create a new one now. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.529
 here the flash and the craque of the subscribed type

 zero point 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 done that we will draw 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.290
 now to vary a little a ball 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 It's good here in the tool pane 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.629
 same place where there is a square is all 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.719
 the tool has a small arrow on 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.270
 lower right corner if you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.840

 have a square can open you draw 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 a ball an oval tool to ok 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.760
 done this holding shift pleasure in the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.860
 Scale I'll hold as from the left. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.530
 Drag to make a ball 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 done that draw this ball I go 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.780
 explain with the company had black in it and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 I'll give you a right mouse button and then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.420
 I'll have to convert to a symbol 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.119
 rock as we are accustomed to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.829
 only this time the symbol will be 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.689
 I'm going to call that movie clip type. 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.320
 ball symbol 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.140
 the clip ok and registration can stay in 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.650
 that the position 0.0 within this 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.800
 symbol 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.230
 done that just the pre-selected 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.980
 this ball now you see in the corner 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.460
 right in the properties panel that we 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.830
 we have a movie clip type symbol 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.380
 Okay, what are we going to do now? 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.120
 come into this new clip realized that we 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.150
 we have our main timeline 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.760
 that to facilitate their identification I 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 I'll give you two clicks here on this layer and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.000
 I'll write the main one is to facilitate your 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.980
 understanding and what we are going to do now 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.470
 enter this world and clip and inside it 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.790
 working on your tv online is good 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.730
 independent of this online afternoon 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.800
 then two clicks here in a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.540
 new clip ball clip we created 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.780
 we will go into it and inside the ball 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.550
 clip we have another timeline 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.040
 regardless of what we're going to do 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.530
 now the shape-type animation 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.490
 we have a first who frame that has 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.790
 this ball 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.670
 the drawings a shape in that position with 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.090
 the properties and I'll create another one 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.720
 who frame aquino 10 right button on 7 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.160
 who frame and aquino in that frame 10 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.620
 with it selected 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.550
 You will give right button Fri 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.780
 transform and then holding out shift 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.900
 a keyboard 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.140
 you will modify the scale is out 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 schiff so that it modifies the scale to 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.840
 from the center of the object 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.840
 done that we have now 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.350
 an online attack inside the ball clip 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.410
 that block freemium has this shape 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.480
 those with these settings and do not have 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.030
 Brake ideas have this shape with these and 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.630
 settings by clicking 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.090
 any frame between 1 and 1 10 with the 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.450
 right click you will then click on 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 create shape turim is a tube in a 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.190
 you can observe 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.100
 the ball faster size will become 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 modifying and determining this size 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.980
 to test inflation we will give 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.600
 control enters keyboard 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.970
 you have acquired this animation and it 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.060
 is happening inside the new clip 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.440
 the movie clip itself is stopped in 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.760
 we have this animation 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.160
 Happening, it's good, let's close it here. 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.410
 Let's do it now and go back to that. 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.109
 main online afternoon where a new 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.930
 clip is inserted to do this you 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.540
 Click on the little set here or else you 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.180
 click on scene one ceni one year will come back 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.940
 O here to sign a tram there has 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 main time that contains in itself muove 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.200
 clip and inside it is that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.290
 time there with that animation that ended 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.900
 to see what he was going to do now is to move 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.370
 the whole new clip with everything that is 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.410
 happening inside him how to make a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.070
 clean as we are already accustomed to 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.480
 do 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.530
 Okay, I'll make an owl then for this. 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.980
 I'm going to raise chickens up to frame 80 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:59.090
 Right click on 7 frame I go 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.060
 add a mosquito in that these 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.520
 frames right button customer muffin 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.000
 turkey 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.900
 and I will inform flash the following the table 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.940
 1 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.909
 this ball will be here in frame 80 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.889
 put this ball here half way 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.009
 here about 40 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.479
 I want her there is no other position and 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.780
 now I'm going to modify the 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.190
 only the next course in the course 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.590
 that line the path may change 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.310
 what the flash will do we will have 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.020
 a movie clip and I will drive 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.740
 make way for this team line 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.990
 observe because here I give to have 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.509
 we have this new drive 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.330
 clip but we know inside it 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.240
 Look, just click here at km 11 and I'm going to give you 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.870
 two clicks to enter the new clip 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:02.740
 we enter it inside it has that other 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:05.560
 animation is not protesting back to 1 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.009
 when we give in control in having the flash 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.449
 compile and if this animation generates a 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.159
 swf file with all the meats is 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:20.169
 working at the same time, it's fine then 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:22.060
 We are going to have the main team and the 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.919
 Clip morph has another animation 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.169
 independent happening 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.969
 Let's see how it goes with the athlete. 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:33.880
 on the keyboard a new clip happens 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.680
 whole is being moved and in 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.729
 he has independent animation 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.930
 happening 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.909
 ok based on this kind of feature of the 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.940
 flash to have a new clip inside 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:47.650
 animations is possible by 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.960
 example to do animation of this type that 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.810
 I'll show you now on the site that 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.380
 made a long time ago I do not have 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.740
 these little planes here information every 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.139
 this is a new clip and in 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.080
 this new clip has another one that is the 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.969
 spinning propeller at 59 has now 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.479
 ball animation 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:12.639
 is decreasing the gta animation of the propeller 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.439
 spinning tatão every airplane of its new 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.689
 clip and inside this new clip in 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:19.899
 independent animation happening that 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:23.729
 they spinning the feature and moved clip 

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:26.439
 will be very important in the construction 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.269
 interactive interfaces we go 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.919
 learn in the next classes because you 

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:31.919
 have enjoyed practicing
