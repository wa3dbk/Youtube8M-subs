surface<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.040> I<00:04:34.070> want<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.490> as<00:04:34.610> even<00:04:34.820> as

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
surface so I want to get as even as

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.030 
surface so I want to get as even as
possible<00:04:35.080> you've<00:04:36.080> got<00:04:36.290> this<00:04:36.410> knob<00:04:36.650> here<00:04:36.890> so

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
possible you've got this knob here so

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.070 
possible you've got this knob here so
you<00:04:37.130> can<00:04:37.250> adjust<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.640> angle<00:04:37.970> back<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.870> forth

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
you can adjust the angle back and forth

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.870 
you can adjust the angle back and forth
there<00:04:39.380> are<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:39.620> knobs<00:04:39.800> back<00:04:40.070> there<00:04:40.310> that

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
there are some knobs back there that

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 
there are some knobs back there that
hold<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.300> down<00:04:41.390> pretty<00:04:41.600> tightly<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.470> way

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
hold it down pretty tightly so the way

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.440 
hold it down pretty tightly so the way
it<00:04:42.650> works<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.070> just<00:04:43.250> you've<00:04:44.060> got<00:04:44.090> this

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
it works so you just you've got this

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.240 
it works so you just you've got this
Universal<00:04:45.050> clip<00:04:45.290> here<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.740> if<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.950> spend<00:04:46.160> too

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
Universal clip here and if I spend too

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.860 
Universal clip here and if I spend too
much<00:04:46.370> time<00:04:46.430> on<00:04:46.730> this<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.150> then<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.480> can<00:04:47.630> this

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
much time on this and then that can this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.710 
much time on this and then that can this
can<00:04:48.470> be<00:04:48.530> rotated<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.250> any<00:04:49.400> angle<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.540> just

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
can be rotated to any angle and you just

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.140 
can be rotated to any angle and you just
slide<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.140> there<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.520> clicks<00:04:52.730> in<00:04:52.880> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
slide it in there and it clicks in and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.260 
slide it in there and it clicks in and
so<00:04:53.330> there<00:04:53.480> we<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.920> drift<00:04:54.920> camera<00:04:55.280> it<00:04:56.030> was

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
so there we have a drift camera it was

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300 
so there we have a drift camera it was
kind<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.510> interesting<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.440> find<00:04:57.920> a<00:04:58.070> place<00:04:58.280> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
kind of interesting to find a place to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.880 
kind of interesting to find a place to
mount<00:04:58.760> all<00:04:59.030> this<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.450> wanted<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.260> as<00:05:00.440> low<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
mount all this I wanted it as low on the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.980 
mount all this I wanted it as low on the
bike<00:05:01.070> as<00:05:01.250> possible<00:05:01.820> but<00:05:02.420> at<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.600> same<00:05:02.750> time

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
bike as possible but at the same time

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.690 
bike as possible but at the same time
yeah<00:05:03.410> you've<00:05:03.650> got<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.890> watch<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.400> for<00:05:04.430> your

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
yeah you've got to watch out for your

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.790 
yeah you've got to watch out for your
legs<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.090> where<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:05.990> path<00:05:06.200> of<00:05:06.380> travel<00:05:06.590> is

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
legs and where that path of travel is

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.590 
legs and where that path of travel is
going<00:05:06.920> to<00:05:07.010> be<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:07.760> but<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.090> works<00:05:08.330> out<00:05:08.450> pretty

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
going to be so but this works out pretty

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.900 
going to be so but this works out pretty
cool<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:09.200> can<00:05:09.650> see<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.190> frame<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.730> might

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
cool I can see in the frame you might

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.580 
cool I can see in the frame you might
have<00:05:11.000> seen<00:05:11.090> some<00:05:11.330> other<00:05:11.390> videos<00:05:11.780> see<00:05:12.470> this
