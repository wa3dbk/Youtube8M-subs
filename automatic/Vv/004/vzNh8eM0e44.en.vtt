00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.390
 luxury guest in 'the party of 12' of the chain cope there was xabi 

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:09.340
 alonso who first greeted the reaction and then sent this message of 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.340
 tranquility for all Real Madrid supporters before Sevilla 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.289
 but he knows that whoever plays from his teammates will more than meet the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.029
 player is 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.890
 that are going to supply that adventure started when I do not share that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.159
 group 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.289
 no no no me that has taken us great detours 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 before or after this action and well then 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 I did not want to get lost because she had marcelo had taken the fifth 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.210
 that he did not play there hands on his part montoro is a shame but good some 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.440
 Once with the expo khedira with the two xabi alonso it feels good in the center of the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 field but who undoubtedly brings more benefits efe mesut ozil 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.640
 my function as a game more not because they are very much traveled both and in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.930
 change I'm a bit more positional more than trying to be close to the 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 gold companions 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770
 as much as possible take out 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.550
 that I did not get excited either because I did not know where I was 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.270
 in front of messi has more mobility moved between the lines 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 and that for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.380
 for my way of playing the sun 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.780
 It suits me very well when he tried to hook a balaclava with her 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.010
 ease I think we are missing we are in that will not try for the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.380
 contend a little more but a little more pause 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.690
 but not without doubt of the loans with those who were up the potential the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.890
 imbalance that they have 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.130
 it's much harder to find that the other does not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.160
 but trying to exploit that 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.170
 and then 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.150
 finding your moments of pause to better control the pair of these weapons 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.770
 like to have a little bit of respite 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.850
 we're on that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.939
 xabi alonso and josé mouriño have something in common the two are data strategists 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.150
 the Basque inside the pitch and the Portuguese from the band he prepares 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.900
 very well 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.700
 scientific situations that 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.970
 that then the match for porto time can be 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.990
 this is an a priori approach 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.500
 but if you want to rectify on the fly 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 and he is very good at rectifying and analyzing 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.460
 during the game like how is the situation 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.010
 and then also poses well now 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.910
 The possible problems are situations that may arise before the game 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.780
 bosh shows a solution you comment and to finish what better than your goods 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 that's why xabi alonso dreams above 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.179
 we are per 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.489
 this one is mine 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.659
 Mommy missed the league 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.319
 denounced in a league that the second both with the real with liverpool and the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.389
 Real Madrid 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.479
 that is, he does not know does not answer 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.839
 I did not expect this Tuesday
