00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.710
 so good afternoon today I want to show 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.730
 how does the alarm work I already 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 wrote a blog already installed on 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 a car with an additional relay unit 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.570
 for short signals because 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.880
 some install ask questions 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 skype in a personal answer seems to be like 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 there is nothing complicated but not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.950
 there were future issues like this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:52.050
 I will try to freeze everything on the phone 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:57.480
 so open the hood here will be 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.730
 the bell here is on it capacitors and 2-paradise 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:08.360
 the capacitor here is 10 thousand microfarad 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.360
 you can substitute and less will be less 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.540
 close here is armed 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.470
 disarmed but i don't have 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 short signals that is only if 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.119
 some door is not closed right now 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.119
 I will arm with an open door 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.240
 here she reports 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:43.259
 opened i mean i close put on 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 security can also be short here if juice 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:52.670
 the sensor from work does not work froze 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.670
 probably now try on the glass 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:42.440
 worked for completely often he sent for 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:45.230
 a day before the birds descend around 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.100
 the short one just worked it up let's say 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:58.220
 so that time 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:03:04.310
 10 thousand microfarad which is about to weight 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:08.870
 fully worked with in general here is 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.260
 Here is such a system, everything works 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.900
 the circuit will be attached to the video in onboard 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.100
 magazine and blog everything is nothing complicated 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.239
 all is not elementary and simple and all this 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.239
 really works on the car
