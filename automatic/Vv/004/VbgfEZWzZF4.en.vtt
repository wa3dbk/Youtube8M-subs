00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
charge them both concurrently so for

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
battery but if you want to be a little

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.809 
battery but if you want to be a little
bit<00:02:46.750> safer<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.500> again<00:02:48.160> I've<00:02:48.280> never<00:02:48.310> tested

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
bit safer and again I've never tested

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.630 
bit safer and again I've never tested
this<00:02:49.150> bag<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> hope<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.900> never<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.640> but

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
this bag and I hope I never have to but

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.759 
this bag and I hope I never have to but
something<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.180> do<00:02:52.329> when<00:02:53.079> I'm<00:02:53.200> charging<00:02:53.560> my

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
something that I do when I'm charging my

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.690 
something that I do when I'm charging my
batteries<00:02:54.390> I'll<00:02:55.390> put<00:02:55.569> them<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.840> lipo<00:02:56.319> bag

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
batteries I'll put them in this lipo bag

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
batteries I'll put them in this lipo bag
then<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.880> way<00:02:58.030> should<00:02:58.090> something

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
then that way should something

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.930 
then that way should something
catastrophic<00:02:59.170> happen

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
catastrophic happen

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.589 
catastrophic happen
this<00:03:01.209> may<00:03:01.540> reduce<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.849> possibility<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:04.420> a

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
this may reduce the possibility of a

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.050 
this may reduce the possibility of a
fire<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:05.920> said<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.130> haven't<00:03:06.340> tested<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.849> may

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
fire like I said I haven't tested it may

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
fire like I said I haven't tested it may
or<00:03:07.239> may<00:03:07.360> not<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.590> can<00:03:08.739> check<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.190> link
