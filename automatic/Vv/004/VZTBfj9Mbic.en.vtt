00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
up back in the day when before they even
made<00:00:37.140> those<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.280> probably<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:38.640> them

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
made those but the probably make them

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
made those but the probably make them
now<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> center<00:00:41.989> plate

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
now and I actually had the center plate

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.220 
now and I actually had the center plate
curved<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.040> doesn't<00:00:44.489> look<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.789> big<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.510> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
curved so it doesn't look as big I think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
curved so it doesn't look as big I think
it<00:00:46.320> looks<00:00:46.469> much<00:00:46.980> better<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> curved

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
