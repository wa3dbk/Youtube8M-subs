00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
this is the circuit in connector so you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.819 
this is the circuit in connector so you
will<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:38.180> 30<00:00:39.180> pin<00:00:39.960> connection<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
will need to have a 30 pin connection on

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.360 
will need to have a 30 pin connection on
your<00:00:41.040> iPad<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.590> Lightning

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
your iPad if you have the Lightning

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.740 
your iPad if you have the Lightning
connection<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.690> will<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.050> another<00:00:46.530> product

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
connection you will need another product

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.200 
connection you will need another product
but<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> will<00:00:50.280> connect<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:51.030> your

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
but the way it will connect with your

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.040 
but the way it will connect with your
keyboard<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.719> end

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
keyboard will be the same the other end

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.670 
keyboard will be the same the other end
of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> cable<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:59.370> goes<00:00:59.670> at<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of the cable is here and it goes at the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
of the cable is here and it goes at the
back<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.340> keyboard<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:07.970> now<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.030> just

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
back of the keyboard here now you just

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.520 
back of the keyboard here now you just
need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> open<00:01:10.409> GarageBand<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:15.119> working

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.270 

this<00:01:21.530> was<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> grand<00:01:22.070> piano<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.520> can<00:01:22.880> choose<00:01:24.280> any

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
this was a grand piano I can choose any

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:39.460 
this was a grand piano I can choose any
leads<00:01:25.820> like<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.900> working<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
leads like this one is working in the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.649 
leads like this one is working in the
modulation<00:01:39.860> as<00:01:40.160> well

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.020 

you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.840> control<00:01:49.229> any<00:01:49.470> other<00:01:49.770> instrument<00:01:50.400> for

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you can control any other instrument for

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
you can control any other instrument for
example<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.200> guitar<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.670> change<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
example the guitar you can change the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.820 
example the guitar you can change the
octave<00:02:03.920> from<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> higher

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
octave from this you can have a higher

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:19.790 
octave from this you can have a higher
or<00:02:10.280> even<00:02:11.280> higher<00:02:11.489> or<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.880> can<00:02:12.269> come<00:02:12.480> back

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:38.210
