00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Welcome to the brand new 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 samsung mp3 player as once called 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 We got together with the samsung 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 Galaxy S3 presented in London at that time 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.070
 still under the name people 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 how is here on the back unfortunately 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.530
 not described but I have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.929
 We also have it online under the name 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 found paypal costs about 40 euros 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.820
 with a lot of what you do not know why 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.490
 so bad is because of apple here for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.080
 50 euros a 2 gb gets called scale 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 gets what the same functions 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.670
 but that's why you're there 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.140
 better because it has a longer term 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.960
 and you can directly record your music 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 transmitted by a micro sd android 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.110
 So not only that's three 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.120
 but that too had safar and everything 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.270
 which has a micro-usb port here 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 I can transfer music like I do 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.379
 Show you soon when the device 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 unpacked you can mp3 wma flac 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.539
 Play cds and yes here is again 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 the software cremans once windows xp 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.690
 windows computer in general that one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.129
 computer connects and from there the music 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440
 wanted to transfer otherwise we have 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.350
 here the apple design trends 25 grams 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.090
 Metal clip and a sound live in the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 sound of the functions still allowed by 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 Better music quality with the credit too 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 produce by her simply a switch 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 I'll show you 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 we could see that really exists 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.860
 very small and if we are now 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.659
 compare here is for example nokia 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 bluetooth mp3 player not him 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.159
 However, function has nfc and still 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.869
 Anything else can you see that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 device is quite small is namely 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 now more out of the picture and we are looking 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.729
 First of us what we are here for 40 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 euro still get such a packaging 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650
 because that's a lot like us 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 Samsung are also used to something more like 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.770
 here at apple so first of all 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.900
 I'll show you how to do that here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 boring warranty card a quick 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.840
 start guide if we can as i am 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.310
 best you several languages 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.159
 especially without using the device 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.479
 This will be the display for most 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.729
 not easy here then we have 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 simply charger and that one loads that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.180
 device and transmits the music completely 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.619
 just over the headphone jack like 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.570
 we already know it from the apple 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.219
 standard three and a half meters port easy 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.159
 then connect it to the computer 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.979
 charge or transfer to music 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.790
 you can charge directly 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.110
 it will come back again 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.939
 hard artists on the phone for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 example of charging on the computer here with 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.970
 this usb connection so we see 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.340
 can also be similar and of course always 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.959
 still a headset while 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.910
 unfortunately not in her, however, too 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.410
 gold plated and headset or actual 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.050
 not here so no microphone for what 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.239
 should the need here already 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.620
 then of course we have the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.050
 mp3-player we can do 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.489
 by pulling the whole thing on here and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.799
 we can still move comes 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.209
 in this live in this sound function 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.709
 on the other side we still have 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.660
 catch up button because the whole is here 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.799
 from e touch and so not all 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.150
 and how touched in the bag 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.799
 trouser pocket or otherwise similar and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.420
 which always jumps back and forth 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.910
 the music we have a button and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.620
 I could choose shuffle and repeat 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 which, of course, here again 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.650
 practically is on Saturday with no 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.540
 connections but feels the metal club 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.370
 also very good at and metal 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.489
 clips are here the further infos 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.720
 and specs actually stated the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 must be specified and a reset 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.319
 We also have a little hole here 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.519
 even if something went wrong 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.470
 just take paper clip and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.670
 I stuck the problem 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.590
 but not yet now I take 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.870
 you just times this usb cable which I 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.340
 introduced you earlier and will 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.510
 I follow it on my samsung 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.010
 I already have all music 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.690
 from my samsung transferred to that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.879
 device was then you see how about 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.489
 the interface looks like this 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.850
 works that way and i would do it now 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.730
 Just make the player here 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.500
 just have to and then you have to believe 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.819
 I light up here for a short time or too 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.769
 not in any case that can be green 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.030
 light up red when it's under ten 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.950
 percent is from the battery and then you have to 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.099
 still have a tab hours runtime 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.239
 So you realize the thing has 15 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.519
 hours of music I'm stuck now 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.040
 Just put this on and stuck 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.910
 my samsung s3 and then we'll see 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.349
 what is happening 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.760
 a description Only Always 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.049
 three mentioned that you needed that but 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.870
 of course that happens too 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.430
 android other android devices so if 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.569
 I connect the lights to red, the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.980
 means it is loaded 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.510
 now that should be blue 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.910
 Data transfers can be successful and it 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.109
 will automatically be the file system here 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.389
 open the program and you can see 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.160
 usb drive a was connected 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.359
 did you feel very beautiful and me 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.829
 could music go in here now and 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.299
 here is all the music I have from 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.620
 my s3 played on this and 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.780
 I can actually do that too 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.799
 the music directly on my s3 play 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.180
 which you are very beautiful 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.650
 but without further 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.019
 Descriptions If I have something now 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.079
 I can go out of the menu here 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.270
 just look at my internal map 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.889
 go under music and there would have to 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.090
 everything is empty on the s3 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.940
 I have nothing to teach I have on 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.650
 my micro sd 32 gigabytes here 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.419
 actually everything that is important and me 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 could be back on movies and other 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.509
 transfer 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.129
 Of course, that will become music 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.900
 do not play offered but I can yes 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:44.240
 go in in music and I can 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.280
 Select here a piece of copy and say 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.599
 then go in here right now and then 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 say then and then it will be here 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.860
 recoded and is already like 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.659
 you can see your news end 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.099
 destination polder so there are those 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.259
 file already and i can say override 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.330
 and so just transfer it here and 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.130
 Already is ready for the dirty at 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.530
 music here on it I have 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.970
 about 15 minutes needed to 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
 Transfer that was already 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.120
 gender and notes the operation 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.190
 is really very easy what happens 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.780
 Now if I do not have samsung 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.770
 galaxy s3 actions of the description that 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.259
 Let's try it I have it here 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.810
 namely that HTC also has Android 4.0 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.520
 soda and then I put this now completely 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.219
 Just look at it and I'm curious what 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.080
 so nothing happens first 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.810
 therefore will not ever directly 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.380
 So support generally happens 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.699
 I do not think much of a pity and I am 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.960
 Let's see if it's even external 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.789
 storage memory is recognized 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.259
 space 95 employees and otherwise here 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.449
 not really, I just also 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.590
 micro sd in it so that's there 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.199
 I have not seen it I hope I have 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.240
 now here is a data transfer program 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.599
 What was wrong with me today? 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.449
 open it is normal to them the 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.430
 programs again so I'm looking for 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.460
 Of course I always have it here 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.719
 Nothing tastes beforehand so that's how it is 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.860
 as you probably do 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.440
 Would you notice I have some here 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.940
 program on it first since I have even 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.099
 not looked I have no here 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.870
 fall trance trading program on it though 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.400
 Nevertheless, that's a pity, of course 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.050
 and of course I will also one 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.460
 few other samsung devices test with 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.770
 the emergency should not be a problem 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.029
 but yes I will contact you again if 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.889
 I 'm starting to get a little more frustrated 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.779
 otherwise we find the device really 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.229
 very chic the connections and everything 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:29.090
 really nice and the music 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.009
 term and the loud the quality of 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.449
 music is also very nice and straight 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.080
 this function as yours 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.970
 Samsung mobile phone 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.500
 apparently far only music bears 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.599
 can transfer is really very 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.879
 Practically because you really need no 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.020
 notebook for data transfer if it is 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.939
 to things need until next my 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.050
 name is've watched pascal long 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:47.050
 and that was one of the tv
