was a bit of a struggle because coming
up<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.850> poses<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.289> bit<00:00:49.890> harder<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.489> me

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
represent mother nature but it's also a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.240 
represent mother nature but it's also a
cross<00:02:11.850> between<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:13.230> universe<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.860> Maya<00:02:14.100> is

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
cross between the universe that Maya is

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.210 
cross between the universe that Maya is
from<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.330> Atari<00:02:15.810> created<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> universe

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
from that Atari created in the universe

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520 
from that Atari created in the universe
that<00:02:17.250> I've<00:02:17.700> created<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.540> my<00:02:18.990> original

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that I've created for my original

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.130 
that I've created for my original
characters<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:20.850> why<00:02:21.030> her<00:02:21.300> dress<00:02:21.690> looks

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
characters so that's why her dress looks

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.860 
characters so that's why her dress looks
very<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> place<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.840> something<00:02:24.840> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
very out of place and something that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.670 
very out of place and something that
isn't<00:02:25.530> really<00:02:25.709> part<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.820> present-day<00:02:27.780> sort

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
isn't really part of a present-day sort

everywhere<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.700> but<00:04:16.660> like<00:04:16.840> it's<00:04:17.079> starting<00:04:17.440> to

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
everywhere and but like it's starting to

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.830 
everywhere and but like it's starting to
and<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.220> starting<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.699> cool<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.940> little<00:04:19.599> bit

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
and it's starting to cool a little bit

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.140 
and it's starting to cool a little bit
and<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:20.919> really<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.700> time<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.120> year

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
and so I really like that time of year

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.750 
and so I really like that time of year
just<00:04:22.690> because<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.470> don't<00:04:23.560> know<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:24.160> the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
just because like I don't know it's the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.330 
just because like I don't know it's the
colors<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.360> starting<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.870> change<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.830> like

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
colors are starting to change and like

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.210 
colors are starting to change and like
it's<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:29.080> colors<00:04:29.470> start<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.889> get<00:04:30.099> a<00:04:30.130> bit

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
it's the colors start to get a bit

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.379 
it's the colors start to get a bit
warmer<00:04:30.849> so<00:04:31.450> that's<00:04:32.320> what<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.740> color<00:04:33.010> scheme

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
warmer so that's what the color scheme

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.870 
warmer so that's what the color scheme
symbolizes<00:04:34.710> yeah<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.950> that's<00:04:36.160> also<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.639> time

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
symbolizes yeah and that's also the time

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.770 
symbolizes yeah and that's also the time
of<00:04:37.060> year<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.630> like<00:04:38.229> my<00:04:38.710> story<00:04:39.099> begins<00:04:39.780> with

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
of year that like my story begins with

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.200 
of year that like my story begins with
like<00:04:41.260> my<00:04:41.500> two<00:04:41.560> characters<00:04:42.130> Isaac<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.880> Tuco

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
like my two characters Isaac and I Tuco

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.060 
like my two characters Isaac and I Tuco
it's<00:04:43.720> around<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.050> same<00:04:44.260> time<00:04:44.289> where<00:04:44.830> their

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
it's around the same time where their

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.390 
it's around the same time where their
story<00:04:45.370> starts<00:04:45.849> so<00:04:46.810> that's<00:04:47.349> why<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.620> chose<00:04:48.099> that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
story starts so that's why I chose that

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.529 
story starts so that's why I chose that
time<00:04:48.699> of<00:04:48.910> year<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.680> there's<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.880> some<00:04:52.210> tree

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
time of year so there's like some tree

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.890 
time of year so there's like some tree
branches<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:53.470> are<00:04:53.530> part<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.310> like

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
branches that are part of the like

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.589 
branches that are part of the like
purplish<00:04:55.900> beige<00:04:56.229> ish<00:04:56.590> park<00:04:56.979> thing<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:58.360> is

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
from her dress represent like tree roots

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.510

and how they kind of like spread out
from<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.629> actual<00:05:20.499> tree<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:22.360> costume<00:05:22.840> is

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
from the actual tree and the costume is

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.679 
from the actual tree and the costume is
essentially<00:05:23.680> just<00:05:23.949> my<00:05:24.550> own<00:05:24.729> creation<00:05:25.240> and

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689 
essentially just my own creation and

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.129 
essentially just my own creation and
what<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:25.870> design<00:05:26.409> for<00:05:26.830> my<00:05:26.949> characters<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:28.139> so

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
what I design for my characters and so

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.019 
what I design for my characters and so
this<00:05:29.259> is<00:05:29.319> what<00:05:29.710> Maya<00:05:29.979> would<00:05:30.310> look<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.699> kind

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
this is what Maya would look like kind

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.490 
this is what Maya would look like kind
of<00:05:31.090> part<00:05:31.389> of<00:05:31.449> my<00:05:31.659> universe<00:05:32.249> so<00:05:33.249> yeah<00:05:34.349> for<00:05:35.349> this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
of part of my universe so yeah for this

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.159 
of part of my universe so yeah for this
picture<00:05:35.800> towards<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.610> end<00:05:36.879> I<00:05:37.300> sort<00:05:37.870> of<00:05:37.990> had

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
picture towards the end I sort of had

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.339 
picture towards the end I sort of had
issues<00:05:38.770> with<00:05:39.159> live<00:05:40.060> stream<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:40.659> Photoshop

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
issues with live stream and Photoshop

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.129 
issues with live stream and Photoshop
together<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:42.789> basically<00:05:43.389> what<00:05:43.629> happened<00:05:44.020> is

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
together so basically what happened is

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.610 
together so basically what happened is
live<00:05:45.129> stream<00:05:45.550> was<00:05:45.759> starting<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.330> lag<00:05:46.599> and<00:05:46.960> slow

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
live stream was starting to lag and slow

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.999 
live stream was starting to lag and slow
down<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:48.370> glitch<00:05:48.789> out<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:50.229> because<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.860> was

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
down and glitch out and because that was

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.890 
down and glitch out and because that was
happening<00:05:51.279> with<00:05:51.639> live<00:05:51.909> stream<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.449> ended<00:05:52.779> up

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
happening with live stream it ended up

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.679 
happening with live stream it ended up
affecting<00:05:53.620> Photoshop<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.580> I<00:05:55.330> didn't<00:05:55.569> really

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:55.689 
affecting Photoshop and I didn't really

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.779 
affecting Photoshop and I didn't really
realize<00:05:55.810> until<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.770> was<00:05:56.860> too<00:05:57.069> late<00:05:57.099> so<00:05:57.610> then

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
realize until it was too late so then

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.779 
realize until it was too late so then
photoshop<00:05:58.449> essentially<00:05:59.110> just<00:05:59.349> crashed<00:05:59.860> and<00:06:00.249> i

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
photoshop essentially just crashed and i

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.649 
photoshop essentially just crashed and i
lost<00:06:00.819> about<00:06:01.479> an<00:06:01.870> hour<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.520> half<00:06:03.729> maybe<00:06:04.089> two

background<00:06:13.330> isn't<00:06:13.599> as<00:06:14.020> nice<00:06:14.289> as<00:06:14.560> I<00:06:14.680> like

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
background isn't as nice as I like

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.010 
background isn't as nice as I like
intended<00:06:15.819> it<00:06:15.939> to<00:06:15.969> be<00:06:16.089> but<00:06:16.419> I<00:06:16.479> was<00:06:16.659> really

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
intended it to be but I was really

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.279 
intended it to be but I was really
really<00:06:17.289> running<00:06:17.589> out<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.860> time<00:06:18.189> so<00:06:18.669> I<00:06:18.909> just

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
really running out of time so I just

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.589 
really running out of time so I just
really<00:06:20.289> needed<00:06:20.500> it<00:06:20.740> to<00:06:20.889> be<00:06:21.159> finished<00:06:21.789> and<00:06:22.089> I'm

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
really needed it to be finished and I'm

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.379 
really needed it to be finished and I'm
actually<00:06:23.169> really<00:06:23.649> happy<00:06:23.800> with<00:06:24.310> the<00:06:24.430> result<00:06:24.789> so

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
actually really happy with the result so

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.999 
actually really happy with the result so
yeah<00:06:25.539> that's<00:06:25.719> the<00:06:25.930> reason<00:06:26.289> why<00:06:26.319> part<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.889> the

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009
