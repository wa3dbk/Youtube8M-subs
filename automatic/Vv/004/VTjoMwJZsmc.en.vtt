 Many people are still looking for this jailbreak 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.610
 to free your phones applications 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.250
 etcetera very well here we have the iphone 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:40.520
 3g and we will verify that you have the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.520
 version 4.2 point 1 and if it is 4.2.1 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.160
 and good to do this jailbreak 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.090
 we need the snow network program that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.520
 I will leave them in the description 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 to go and download it and we have 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.860
 that download the eye peas w 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.740
 from iphone 3g which is 4.2.1 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.100
 very good so I'm also going to 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.920
 leave 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.640
 in the description a link to go 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.070
 look for it and download it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 and let's start with the video very well 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 suppose this over here 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.920
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.920
 give extras select eye peas w 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.310
 and we look for the double ips that they downloaded 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 which is 4.2.1 restore 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.290
 we will look for it as a team 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780
 here it is 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.950
 we give in accept we come back and you 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.119
 we give in jailbreak 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.119
 and he is preparing 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.369
 we hope very well and there it appears 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.829
 install cydia and other things that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.470
 we can install what we are going what 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.689
 are installers and sidya and in the world 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.909
 watch with porcentage that is the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.739
 percentage of the battery if not 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.280
 disappears at the top and 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:18.340
 there are also the baseband that serve 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.340
 to release the iphones and so on 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.160
 next we give in and asks us to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.830
 turn off our 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 iphone 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.760
 what we are going to do 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.269
 and what we're going to do is we 're going to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.200
 put our iphone in mode of 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.170
 facebook and how it came, he puts the button 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 from next to activated and then we are going to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.439
 do what 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.439
 very well 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.000
 we give in next 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.840
 and first we're going to have to press the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.730
 power button three seconds later to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.520
 same time the home button for 10 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.050
 Seconds later 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.010
 and let go of the button d 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.920
 power for 15 seconds 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.630
 if you did not understand me in the program comes 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.940
 the steps 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.940
 let's make steak the break 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.790
 we give in next 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.060
 as you can see she is doing the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.060
 jailbreak 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.409
 if you do not get the first you can go back 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.659
 and try again because 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.759
 principle if it costs you the steps you 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.199
 you confuse and all that but it 's very 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.729
 simple already after you 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.499
 you get used to 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.499
 and here he is already doing 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.990
 and the program tells us that we can already 

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:41.670
 disconnect the cable 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.480
 because the whole process is being 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.740
 making on the iphone but for 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.230
 create insurance you do not have to disconnect 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.230
 nothing good what I recommend is that 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.750
 as power they will be able to see says jailbreak the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.750
 pineapple networks now 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.620
 let's hope 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.770
 this takes around some 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.190
 minutes 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.190
 so do not despair if it takes 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.210
 Well I'm going to put it in fast camera 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.449
 because faster is shorter the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.449
 video 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.700
 very good there the iphone and I just did 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.700
 the jailbreak 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.500
 I had to cut the video because it was 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.500
 I was ending my life to the camera 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.610
 there's the iphone on 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.610
 we unlock 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.310
 and as you can see there is Syria 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.110
 we click 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.999
 we give it to the user 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.420
 and is using the packages and everything 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.750
 that 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.450
 and so here's the video today how 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.470
 jailbreak an iphone 3g 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:59.020
 4.2.1 conversion 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:02.040

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.040

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.710
 share it with your friends 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:11.090

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.860
