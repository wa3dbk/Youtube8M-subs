00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.450
 there are accidents in life that leave you 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.879
 marked by that today 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.980
 I will talk about the scars that I have and 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.349
 how I have done them in order 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.900
 chronological always being a person 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.330
 who loves sports and is 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.310
 up and down has that come and go of the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 life there are times when I 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.740
 hurt the first one was this 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.040
 it was because of my sister when I had 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 about four medical years that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.199
 run with your hands back where 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 there were some obstacles but obviously 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.750
 he did it with all the intention the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 intention that his brother was with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.040
 hands back and it fell down I do not think it's 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 very funny fun to run with 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.680
 hands back where there are obstacles and that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 my brother say wow what fun game 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 If you achieve it with all the intention and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 you will say what an idiot to make him 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 case to 24 years we are all idiots the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.369
 second scar and I think the most 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 painful was this this is one of those and I 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.160

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.570
 brother was understanding the bed not in 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.410
 the bed was like this and they were 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.550
