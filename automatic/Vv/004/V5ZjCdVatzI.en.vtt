remember<00:00:20.160> points<00:00:20.520> ignition<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.750> problem

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
remember points ignition the problem

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
remember points ignition the problem
with<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.680> when<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> points<00:00:23.310> start<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
with them is when the points start to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
with them is when the points start to
wear<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.269> timing<00:00:24.810> changes<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.769> dwell<00:00:26.070> time

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
wear the timing changes the dwell time

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
wear the timing changes the dwell time
changes<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.689> affects<00:00:28.140> your

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
changes which which has affects your

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
changes which which has affects your
coil<00:00:28.590> saturation<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> course

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
coil saturation and then of course

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.569 
coil saturation and then of course
that's<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> affect<00:00:31.260> fuel<00:00:31.560> mileage<00:00:31.800> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that's going to affect fuel mileage so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.510 
that's going to affect fuel mileage so
why<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.989> modern-day<00:00:34.590> system<00:00:35.219> with

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
why not go to a modern-day system with

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
why not go to a modern-day system with
electronic<00:00:36.180> ignition<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.140> once<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.559> eliminate

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
electronic ignition so once we eliminate

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.119 
electronic ignition so once we eliminate
here<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.059> points<00:00:39.570> base<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.770> condenser

thing<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.450> checked<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.380> centrifugal<00:01:19.950> advance

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
thing I checked the centrifugal advance

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
thing I checked the centrifugal advance
that's<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> part<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> moves<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.049> I've

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that's the part that moves here I've

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.740 
that's the part that moves here I've
lubricated<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.670> nowhere<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.600> or

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
lubricated and there's nowhere in it or

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
lubricated and there's nowhere in it or
no<00:01:24.930> extreme<00:01:25.670> usage<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.180> again<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
no extreme usage in it so again for the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
no extreme usage in it so again for the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
mileage saan this car in the age
everything<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.600> great<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
everything was great here but be sure to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
everything was great here but be sure to
check<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.189> once<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.450> installed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
check that once you have that installed

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
check that once you have that installed
now<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> reason<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.070> didn't<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> pull

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
now the reason we didn't have to pull

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
now the reason we didn't have to pull
the<00:01:35.909> distributor<00:01:36.090> apart<00:01:36.780> normally<00:01:37.140> you'd

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the distributor apart normally you'd

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
the distributor apart normally you'd
have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.500> drive<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.979> roll<00:01:38.250> pin<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:39.000> the

gear out and take the shaft they make

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
gear out and take the shaft they make
the<00:01:41.640> window<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> point

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the window that actually is the point

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
the window that actually is the point
that<00:01:44.159> breaks<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> electronic<00:01:45.299> ignition<00:01:45.570> and

that breaks the electronic ignition and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
that breaks the electronic ignition and
they<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:46.740> pieces<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> put<00:01:47.820> one

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
they make it in two pieces so I put one

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
they make it in two pieces so I put one
piece<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.420> under<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> side<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.500> under<00:01:49.710> this

going<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.490> use<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> new<00:03:05.970> coil<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.840> going

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
going to use a new coil now it's going

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.690 
going to use a new coil now it's going
to<00:03:06.990> look<00:03:07.080> exactly<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.950> original<00:03:08.580> oil

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
to look exactly like the original oil

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.580 
to look exactly like the original oil
filled<00:03:09.000> coil<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:09.840> it's<00:03:09.990> designed<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.500> the

filled coil but it's designed for the
electronic<00:03:11.130> ignition<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:11.790> right<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.030> it's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
electronic ignition that's right so it's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.420

the Excel Super Stock now again you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.860 
the Excel Super Stock now again you
can't<00:03:14.670> use<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.030> points<00:03:15.390> coil<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
kind of spark this is going to give you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.850 
kind of spark this is going to give you
plenty<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.840> spark<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.770> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
plenty of spark you can have the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.680 
plenty of spark you can have the
capacity<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.580> over<00:03:20.790> 50,000<00:03:21.480> volts

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
capacity to be over 50,000 volts

capacity to be over 50,000 volts
probably<00:03:21.930> close<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> 60,000<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.190> need

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
probably close to the 60,000 if you need

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.100 
probably close to the 60,000 if you need
it<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:24.090> shouldn't<00:03:24.390> need<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.630> with<00:03:24.720> new<00:03:24.840> plugs

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
it you shouldn't need it with new plugs

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.530 
it you shouldn't need it with new plugs
wires<00:03:25.410> cap<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.130> rotor<00:03:26.220> we<00:03:26.880> put<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> bolt<00:03:27.390> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540

course<00:03:30.209> we're<00:03:30.330> ready<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.600> start<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.020> we're

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
course we're ready to start but we're

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.000 
course we're ready to start but we're
going<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> go<00:03:31.350> ahead<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.590> do<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> couple<00:03:31.980> things

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to go ahead and do a couple things

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.350 
going to go ahead and do a couple things
at<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.280> cooling<00:03:32.580> system<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.060> right<00:03:33.180> now<00:03:33.300> we

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
at a cooling system but right now we

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.250 
at a cooling system but right now we
need<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.660> take<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.810> break

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
need to take a break

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.440 
need to take a break
stick<00:03:34.770> around<00:03:34.800> we<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:35.489> full<00:03:35.730> finish<00:03:36.330> up

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
stick around we get back full finish up

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.580 
stick around we get back full finish up
the<00:03:36.570> cooling<00:03:36.870> system<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.200> make<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:37.530> thing

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the cooling system and make this thing

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.380 
the cooling system and make this thing
make<00:03:38.040> smoke<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.730> think<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.209> think

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
make smoke what do you think I think

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.890 
make smoke what do you think I think
yeah

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
yeah

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.959 
yeah
