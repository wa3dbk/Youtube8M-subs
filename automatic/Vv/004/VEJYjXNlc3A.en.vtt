how<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.970> pedal<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:32.080> out<00:02:32.350> in

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
how you can pedal you can see out in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.020 
how you can pedal you can see out in
front<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.799> boat<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.519> know<00:02:33.549> if<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.850> sight

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
front of the boat you know if your sight

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.850 
front of the boat you know if your sight
fishing<00:02:34.239> if<00:02:34.989> you're<00:02:35.200> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.470> standing

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
fishing if you're going to be standing

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.140 
fishing if you're going to be standing
up<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.069> lot<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:36.400> nice<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> seat<00:02:37.060> in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
up a lot it's nice to have the seat in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.850 
up a lot it's nice to have the seat in
this<00:02:37.209> position<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.350> up<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.739> down<00:02:38.830> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
this position you can get up and down a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.220 
this position you can get up and down a
lot<00:02:39.130> easier<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:40.209> hearing<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> boat<00:02:41.110> is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
lot easier the hearing on the boat is

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.440 
lot easier the hearing on the boat is
actually<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.400> handle<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.299> can

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
actually on this this handle and you can

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.360 
actually on this this handle and you can
see<00:02:43.630> as<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.900> move<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.319> on<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> other<00:02:45.099> side<00:02:45.340> of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
see as I move it on the other side of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.180 
see as I move it on the other side of
the<00:02:45.519> boat<00:02:45.670> there's<00:02:46.420> also<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.810> second<00:02:47.290> steering

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the boat there's also a second steering

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.830 
the boat there's also a second steering
control<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.880> switch<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.420> handle<00:02:49.750> to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
control so I can switch the handle to

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.390 
control so I can switch the handle to
either<00:02:49.959> side<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.410> boat<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.739> make

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
either side of the boat and make

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.740 
either side of the boat and make
adjustments<00:02:51.549> with<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> rudder<00:02:52.329> that's<00:02:52.630> in

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
adjustments with the rudder that's in

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.640 
adjustments with the rudder that's in
the<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:54.359> other<00:02:55.359> than<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.500> bottom

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the back other than that on the bottom

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.949 
the back other than that on the bottom
of<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.040> boat<00:02:57.220> what<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.180> did<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.540> try<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.750> make

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
of the boat what we did to try to make

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.539 
of the boat what we did to try to make
it<00:02:59.019> easier<00:02:59.769> if<00:03:00.010> you're<00:03:00.190> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> be

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
it easier if you're going to be

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.180 
it easier if you're going to be
installing<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:01.090> fish<00:03:01.269> finder<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.500> if<00:03:03.070> we

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
installing a fish finder this is if we

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.979 
installing a fish finder this is if we
were<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.370> flip<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.640> boat<00:03:03.790> over<00:03:03.870> integrate<00:03:04.870> it

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
were to flip the boat over integrate it

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.340 
were to flip the boat over integrate it
into<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.230> bottom<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.579> ranch<00:03:06.910> ready

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
into the bottom so it's a ranch ready

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.259 
into the bottom so it's a ranch ready
transducer<00:03:08.350> mount<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:09.370> mount<00:03:09.579> our<00:03:09.700> transducer

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
transducer mount we mount our transducer

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.840 
transducer mount we mount our transducer
in<00:03:10.390> here<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:10.959> actually<00:03:11.350> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> be

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
in here and it's actually going to be

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.460 
in here and it's actually going to be
safe<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.480> you're<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:13.959> able<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.140> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
safe so you're going to be able to you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.170 
safe so you're going to be able to you
know<00:03:14.590> ride<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.430> boat<00:03:15.549> right<00:03:15.730> up<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.030> beach

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
know ride the boat right up on the beach

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.250 
know ride the boat right up on the beach
or<00:03:16.359> anything<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.810> going<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.049> hurt<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
or anything it's not going to hurt the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.720 
or anything it's not going to hurt the
transducer<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:18.130> going<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.609> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
transducer and it's going to be in the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.009 
transducer and it's going to be in the
water<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.329> going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> get<00:03:19.600> temperature

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
water so it's going to get temperature

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.420 
water so it's going to get temperature
readings<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.160> make<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
readings and it's going to make the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.920 
readings and it's going to make the
install<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.790> your<00:03:22.060> transducer<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.600> lot<00:03:22.780> easier

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930

der<00:04:28.889> any<00:04:29.039> thing<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.370> just<00:04:29.550> screw<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.389> blocks

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
der any thing you just screw the blocks

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.090 
der any thing you just screw the blocks
right<00:04:31.110> into<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> boat<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:31.800> ready<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.010> go

right into the boat and it's ready to go

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.379 
right into the boat and it's ready to go
and<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.430> should<00:04:32.580> make<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.820> installation<00:04:33.000> a

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
and it should make the installation a

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.900 
and it should make the installation a
lot<00:04:33.570> easier<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:34.400> think<00:04:35.400> that's<00:04:35.669> about<00:04:35.789> it
