00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
crust at the edge you can leave them a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.400 
crust at the edge you can leave them a
little<00:01:29.440> bit<00:01:29.770> higher<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.180> keep<00:01:31.420> doing<00:01:32.080> it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.749 
and I flip it again and what happens you
have<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.660> always<00:01:37.869> make<00:01:38.290> sure<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.400> flour

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
have to always make sure that the flour
