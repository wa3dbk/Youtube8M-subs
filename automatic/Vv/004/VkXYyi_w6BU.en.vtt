 a varnishing of the wooden construction area 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 instead we oiled the wood like that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.239
 the wood can breathe and the natural 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.000
 surface is preserved 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.989

 Footswitch can be used for this control 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 be connected 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.400
 since we are at the organ 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 inverted preset keys of a real 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780

 cap of the encoders is here only 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.729
 provisionally and was in retrospect 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.439
 still replaced in the middle over the keyboards 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.979

 Rule are rasterized and give the 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.079
 instrument so the feeling of a real one 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.910

 organ is also supplied with electricity 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.739
 This is followed by the bushes for one-horse drivers 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.959
 pedal a switch pedal to control the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.220
 switch to an almost treble mode 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.139
 in this mode, the stop will be 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.690
 dynamics the keyboards handling the 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.769
