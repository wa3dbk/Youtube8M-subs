00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.679
 he has also placed the rest this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.679
 to the original 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.350
 and the other person 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.210
 and it's not like that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.210
 he gets ahead of 15-3 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.980
 suddenly he has trusted here he has 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.980
 trusted 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.600
 to be played there on the side of the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.050
 right many double faults to the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.050
 compensation 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 to block 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.420
 service message 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 Y 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 s 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 only me 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.830
 or they hit them harder 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.710
 crusade 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.350
 two 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.040
 but not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.830
 High level authentic show 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 tennis in these hours 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.030
 in which it has been put that you carry the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.160
 number three in the world this recently 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.160
 He was the French captain of the Davis Cup 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.440
 I combined the two charges 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.800
 we keep celebrating 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.170
 as a break against as we see there 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.330
 that his life gave his life to the network 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.150
 takes out the ass novak djokovic by uploading 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.940
 that ends up failing and then the volley and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.190
 now as we see 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 because it comes up as two faults 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.420
 with four aces 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.700
 we are much better 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.700
 I am already famous 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.220
 just press 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.190
 He counterattacks does not leave them perfect 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.560
 the first this second advantage pull out 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.000
 but not 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.580
 on your side and therefore in this 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.980
 second set espa 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.230
 Novak Djokovic for this scoreboard 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.230
 it would be very bad tastes 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.550
 and run 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.660
 so that I do 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.660
 and there is a dream 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.720
 separated 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.930
 but they will soon leave 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.930
 then normal normal 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.580
 this reminds me 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.080
 I thought I did not pass the ball 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.790
 the auction was very complicated 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.000
 makes him is left 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:55.470
 federer that look at the globe 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.470
 willy as far 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.380
 the rest 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.460
 from right to right that right here 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.699
 of the man who puts out his fist for the 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.699
 cibir 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.460
 there you have me 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.370
 there is the trust 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.370
 in the end it seems that he is already djokovic 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:38.830
 and there it is 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:42.009
 the party shouted novak djokovic 2 to 1 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.939
 partial of 4-6 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:49.869

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:52.240
