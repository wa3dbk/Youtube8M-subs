so let's get started this is really
really<00:01:10.000> easy<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.830> I'm<00:01:11.890> gonna<00:01:11.980> start<00:01:12.370> by

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
really easy so I'm gonna start by

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.370 
really easy so I'm gonna start by
putting<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.940> frozen<00:01:13.540> strawberries<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.260> the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
blender first because those are gonna be

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.720 
blender first because those are gonna be
a<00:01:18.940> little<00:01:19.240> bit<00:01:19.360> more<00:01:19.540> difficult<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.490> blend<00:01:21.490> up

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
a little bit more difficult to blend up

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.730 
a little bit more difficult to blend up
because<00:01:22.240> they're<00:01:22.480> frozen<00:01:23.050> so<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.350> like<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.590> put

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
that kind of stuff in the blender first

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.010 
that kind of stuff in the blender first
and<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.770> can<00:01:26.950> see<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.570> greens<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.840> the
