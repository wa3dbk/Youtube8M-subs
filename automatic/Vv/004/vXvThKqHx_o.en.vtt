00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.530
 we often talk about the shift 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.530
 email remind me 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:09.899
 affect the population 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.899
 and therefore I am 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 yes they can be 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.269
 which can be 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.859
 cardiovascular 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.249
 Because I am 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 those polluting mississippi natisone put 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.970
 and emblematic that in a country that squanders public money in the black hole 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.080
 of songs 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.110
 who carries out independent research and micro-fine dust on nanopathologies 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.650
 as stefano montanari and his wife antonietta gatti is forced to one 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.010
 collection to try to buy a microscope the necessary for these 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010

 night and nanoparticles 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.620
 what are what it means micro and nano particles means 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.360
 dgtv very small 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.690
 that you are micro 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.050
 I'm from 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.500
 order of magnitude of my beautiful meter if I am a damage of the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 billionth of a meter smaller are the particles 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.520
 plus these particles are pathogenic and what it means pathogenic pathogens 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.770
 what does it mean 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.310
 they can generate 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.490
 of diseases 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.590
 + modern tecia attico lucia that I use 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 the higher the operating temperature the smaller the particles are than me 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 tengo 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.190
 which means that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.750
 the beast have the barrel with the g 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 the low the best technology 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.180
 available and that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.640
 who produces the smallest particles we have said to be the most 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.680
 pathogenic 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.960
 what these particles do 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.950
 are 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.539
 expelled by the incinerator in this case but by all the high processes 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.790
 temperature 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.309
 remain suspended in the air 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.689
 falling 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.669
 more or less quickly depending on how big they are 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.659
 dm10 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.859
 who come 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.399
 normally called fine powders 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.979
 for us technicians are not at all fine powders but are called coarse powders 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.819
 and they are the ones that fall first but remain suspended in the air for 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.859
 days several days 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.999
 the smaller particle remains suspended longer 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:38.779
 are 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.729
 carried by the wind 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.470
 riccardo the earth with me the rain little charity itself 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.709
 in the long run 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.729
 the wind that solved

 recalculation circle pictograms resolved sweet cabbage helmet 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.969
 coffee table can be washed because they are very plump 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.019
 but we can make from these particles that we eat the head 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.329
 even animals eat grass on PC I can these particles 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.049
 most of these sensitive parts let us breathe 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.080
 what happens happens that these particles 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.149
 the smaller they are, the deeper they go in ours 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:16.909
 bronchus our lungs 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.529
 that end up in the alveoli 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:24.289
 the innermost deepest part of the lung from here I pass directly into 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:25.479
 blood 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.870
 there is a study done by lovanio university 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.969
 published in 2002 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.049
 which referred to our studies which show that these particles 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.289
 password to alveole blood within a minute 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.159
 and from here they are seized 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.449
 practically from all the organs because the blood does at home we cannot 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.699
 directing blood somewhere 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.369
 these particles are seized for example from the liver 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.019
 I'm talking about educational sites I see every day I'm talking about 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.159
 say something 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.159
 I read about some books 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:04.739
 filming from feb filtered by the film the liver behaves anyway if it is filtered 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.079
 these particles 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.199
 inside the liver 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.519
 they are seen as foreign bodies then our body tries to 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.609
 eliminate them and what it looks for you 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.889
 degradable but unfortunately these particles are not biodegradable 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.489
 for our human dimensions they are eternal 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.900
 the organism tries to isolate them and the islands in effect 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.770
 who does what 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.120
 it's called a granuloma 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 I put in fabric around 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.930
 an insulator 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.930
 which however does not inflammatory tissues since it is an inflammation 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.759
 inflammation that however lasts forever 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.039
 fiat duna 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.710
 chronic inflammation 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.409
 badoo become an actor 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.650
 become a tumor 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.780
 then 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.180
 these particles 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.240
 may be carcinogenic we have 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.020
 several hundred cases our pathological path of writing 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.560
 now 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.560
 but not only do we not only talk about cancers we also talk 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.839
 example mental disorders there are patients 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.080
 Our 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.430
 who come 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.909
 let pass reality piermartini 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.210
 these particles will be in the brain 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.190
 that the gulf syndrome the lucano balkan syndrome we count a lot d 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.999
 military 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.510
 they are all pathologies 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.080
 from high temperatures burst of bombs famous depleted uranium etc. penis 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.759
 these particles also end up in the brain 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.569
 talor the psychiatrist says is necessarily you're crazy you came back from the war 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.759
 misseri but I'm shocked 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.870
 actually their brain is full of these particles, a case of yours even today 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:43.879
 afternoon of this kind 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.129
 what all this means means that lineup 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.259
 manners 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.240
 to get rid of the most insane waste that of the incinerator 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.169
 because we have 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.710
 garbage 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.900
 lousy 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.430
 unpleasant 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.860
 we made it disappear from our eyes 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.090
 we hope transformed into positive little ones little ones 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.699
 if it breaks, they can pulse afterwards
