00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.859
 Hello dear channel viewers 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.600
 repair but today we will show how 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.090
 change the cabin filter on the car 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.690
 Renault Megane 2 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.119
 is he in the passenger part there in 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.640
 the case but to change it correctly 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.949
 we need to remove the glove box 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 what needs to be done coming 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.550
 glove compartment first snaps threshold 2 to 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.490
 the end is not necessarily enough like this 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.700
 from take you yours then shoot here 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.840
 the crust is removed and then suffer much 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.640
 here you can pull a little down here 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.530
 him snaps he's here at the girl's expense 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:54.160
 over than open the glove box disable 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:58.760
 side pillow here snaps skin 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:06.110
 remove the connector from the pillow here 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:10.490
 look very simple checkbox lion unless 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:17.140
 we removed, we immediately see two 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.140
 then reksana 20 mounting fishing rod unscrew 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.079
 this pay attention what's where we 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.149
 there is a search for this bracket 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:37.060
 there put a screw here this one this 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:37.060
 one god need a mount fine thread 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.310
 here is shit then when installing, too, not 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.229
 confuse that screw we have here 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.870
 here and see above 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.680
 nose cut up then 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.190
 we can see three more mounts 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 three screws also here is one 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:40.710
 here remains the posts like 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 unscrewed that is here here here 31 here 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.410
 one here we have one bolt for 1 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.810
 see segments is under the stubs such 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.110
 countries to hook and unscrew the last 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.110
 thesis 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.980
 by this 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:11.590
 disclose the glove box and pull it toward you in 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 we get out of here 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.079
 some therefore just from unity 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.540
 here we see the case for it will take place and 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.659
 filter for the convenience of shooting, we shot 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.900
 the duct from clicking on it does not shoot 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:33.159
 also come for convenience 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.470
 will latch it on 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:41.079
 the idea must have an idea 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.420
 here in one place on the article and hold 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:50.349
 on the clip from here bangs and here here 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.129
 so we see two self-tapping screws 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.579
 cabin filter is a freelance self - tapping screws 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.799
 if a 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.390
 either you have not changed either in the heart 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.359
 somewhere you change them may not be 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.180
 but they are sometimes needed because the filter 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.220
 there are bad holds there and there is 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.609
 regular places under the screws but watch 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.269
 they themselves should not be factories 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.269
 unscrew two screws 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.609
 Here we see the regular places so 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.910
 screw the same hole there is so 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:32.280
 You can modify yourself and here we compress 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:35.050
 side filter 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 is inserted one side ie here 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.960
 here he also latch there 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.110
 grabs here that edge we go for 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.090
 before the car that's after when 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.250
 steel filter we have there are many 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.310
 garbage so it can either be compressed 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.090
 air issuance have become this either 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.090
 disable or 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.560
 give out all the trash can then giving birth 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.950
 Naturally there but starting the installation 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.950
 new filter see exactly the same 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.850
 Here we see the fact that he is not 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.510
 therefore snaps into place 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.880
 screw here and use therefore 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.360
 also here if you somewhere when I 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.520
 do 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.020
 ask to pay attention to 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.900
 how the filter is fixed because 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.240
 Often happens the client we assort and 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.430
 filter is half so climbs and 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.210
 naturally blowing is weak because the flow 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.210
 all goes here 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.860
 well and postal how have changed we collect all 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:53.860
 in the opposite approach here it is important not 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.860
 break the switch neat present 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.580
 principle in a different way to put it very 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:09.479
 heavy 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:10.879
 here it is snapped up and twist everything 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:18.000
 watched 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:19.979
 I do not forget that we have a screw here and 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.180
 Now supplies spun all smoy 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:26.099
 cut for convenience remove the lock 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.669
 passenger cushion like it here 2 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:34.560
 what for 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:40.770
 sides on pretty shoot down here we are 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:43.770
 see where we have the latches now 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.789
 there is no difficult to insert the main 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.789
 skip connector
