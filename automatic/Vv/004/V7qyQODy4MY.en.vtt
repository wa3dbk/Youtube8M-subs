00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 but this is also a chapter of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.350
 Naruto 669 I remind you all those 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.910
 people who have not seen the sleeve of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 Naruto to the exact point where he 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.450
 is that you do not see in this video because they are going 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940
 to end up ruining the story by 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 please do not watch this video and like the manga 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.600
 that will come out but in English it is not yet 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.880
 complete this so tomorrow in the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 tomorrow will be in the video well for fear 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 I'm going to tell you what happened 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 first instance I tell them naruto have 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 awakened Naruto opened his eyes and so 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.810
 finished the chapter finished quite 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 weird, I would have liked them to finish 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
 otherwise, everything else was 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 very well and how all this was developed 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 chapter in the fight to send to see their 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 almost sense and sapping guy and gara 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.190
 they are all fighting together and believe me 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 when I tell them that guy sense and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.950
 it became very powerful will send the untouchable 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.870
 the indestructible bleeding by guy 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 sense and why because gays in sex 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 he died too powerful although all 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.239
 we know it's impossible for gay to sense and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
 defeat to kill we know perfectly 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 it's going to be something before we die we're going to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 discover something will demand before dying 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.710
 gais itself is not going to die in vain is not 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.780
 scare but 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 and it's causing you to send your de this 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.040
 so it is so big in fact he spat 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.510
 blood will flow and especially a phrase that 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.300
 he said to command that I could understand 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.369
 perfectly it feels like 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.409
 I was fighting with the first hockey 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.210
 again this powerful though the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.130
 first hockey that can not eject everything 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.259
 your power at this time but we can 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.330
 observe more or less how it was to be able 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.759
 on going up here and sense and hitting 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.530
 wood and I really liked this 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.810
