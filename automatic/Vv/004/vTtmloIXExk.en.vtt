light purple and the reason why I put
the<00:00:33.310> light<00:00:33.340> at<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:33.940> end<00:00:34.150> is<00:00:34.720> because<00:00:35.290> I<00:00:35.620> think

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
the light at the end is because I think

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.890 
the light at the end is because I think
it's<00:00:36.310> always<00:00:36.460> good<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.790> have<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.030> soft<00:00:37.330> color<00:00:37.660> on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
it's always good to have a soft color on

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's always good to have a soft color on
either<00:00:38.140> end<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.740> a<00:00:38.830> rainbow<00:00:39.010> cake<00:00:39.190> you're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
either end of a rainbow cake you're

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.340 
either end of a rainbow cake you're
going<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.730> use<00:00:39.880> for<00:00:40.150> butterflies<00:00:40.630> or<00:00:40.990> a<00:00:41.020> mask

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
going to use for butterflies or a mask

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.820 
going to use for butterflies or a mask
because<00:00:42.130> if<00:00:42.790> you<00:00:43.000> have<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.210> deep<00:00:43.930> color<00:00:44.320> for<00:00:44.740> the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
because if you have a deep color for the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.650 
because if you have a deep color for the
outside<00:00:45.310> or<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.580> inside<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:46.240> just<00:00:46.420> looks<00:00:46.600> too

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
outside or the inside it just looks too

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.140 
outside or the inside it just looks too
hard<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.890> lighter<00:00:48.160> colors<00:00:48.520> blend<00:00:48.850> with<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
hard the lighter colors blend with the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.210 
hard the lighter colors blend with the
skin<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.450> lot<00:00:49.660> easier<00:00:49.870> so<00:00:50.380> if<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.620> put<00:00:50.830> as<00:00:50.980> nice

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
skin a lot easier so if you put as nice

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.910 
skin a lot easier so if you put as nice
soft<00:00:51.579> color<00:00:51.910> at<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.150> end<00:00:52.380> then<00:00:53.380> it's<00:00:53.740> going<00:00:53.860> to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
soft color at the end then it's going to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.069 
soft color at the end then it's going to
blend<00:00:54.160> right<00:00:54.430> into<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.850> skin<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.900> won't

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
blend right into the skin and it won't

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.930 
blend right into the skin and it won't
be<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:56.470> hard<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.829> make<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.130> look<00:00:57.370> at<00:00:57.460> good<00:00:57.610> pink

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
be so hard to make a look at good pink

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.690 
be so hard to make a look at good pink
on<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.210> inside<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.890> corner<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.340> my<00:01:00.400> eye

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
on the inside at the corner of my eye

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.580 
on the inside at the corner of my eye
I'm<00:01:01.090> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.630> go<00:01:01.690> ahead<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:02.020> pounce<00:01:02.290> this

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
I'm going to go ahead and pounce this

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.340 
I'm going to go ahead and pounce this
down<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.220> just<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.940> edge<00:01:04.149> right<00:01:04.179> here<00:01:04.719> you

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
down on just the edge right here you

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.139 
down on just the edge right here you
don't<00:01:05.469> need<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.799> push<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.249> whole<00:01:06.460> flat<00:01:06.819> part

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
don't need to push the whole flat part

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.669 
don't need to push the whole flat part
just<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.659> edge<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:11.170> going<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.409> go<00:01:11.530> to

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
just that edge and I'm going to go to

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.919 
just that edge and I'm going to go to
diagonal<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.549> that<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.939> sponge<00:01:13.359> goes<00:01:13.719> from

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
diagonal so that the sponge goes from

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.190 
diagonal so that the sponge goes from
the<00:01:14.079> corner<00:01:14.439> of<00:01:14.560> my<00:01:14.740> inner<00:01:15.039> eye<00:01:15.310> up<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.719> right

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the corner of my inner eye up to right

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.039 
the corner of my inner eye up to right
before<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.950> arch<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.460> eyebrow<00:01:19.049> that's

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
before the arch of the eyebrow that's

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.590 
before the arch of the eyebrow that's
i'm<00:01:20.259> going<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.499> start<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.429> i'm<00:01:22.359> going<00:01:22.539> to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
i'm going to start it and i'm going to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.499 
i'm going to start it and i'm going to
press<00:01:23.079> down<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:27.100> make<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.609> butterfly<00:01:28.210> wing

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
press down to make that butterfly wing

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.550 
press down to make that butterfly wing
shape<00:01:28.959> until<00:01:29.789> about<00:01:30.789> right<00:01:31.389> here<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.380> don't

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
shape until about right here you don't

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.889 
shape until about right here you don't
want<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.740> go<00:01:32.859> much<00:01:33.009> farther<00:01:33.310> than<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.899> for

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
want to go much farther than that for

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.709 
want to go much farther than that for
the<00:01:35.020> bottom<00:01:35.469> wing<00:01:36.179> i'm<00:01:37.179> going<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.420> start<00:01:37.630> at

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
the bottom wing i'm going to start at

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.679 
the bottom wing i'm going to start at
the<00:01:37.749> cornea<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.200> eye<00:01:38.229> as<00:01:38.319> well<00:01:38.469> and<00:01:38.979> angle<00:01:39.399> my

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the cornea the eye as well and angle my

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.270 
the cornea the eye as well and angle my
sponge<00:01:40.689> down<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.289> i'm<00:01:41.350> going<00:01:41.499> to<00:01:41.560> bend<00:01:42.009> it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
sponge down and i'm going to bend it

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.309 
sponge down and i'm going to bend it
like<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:43.029> so<00:01:43.359> it's<00:01:43.539> shorter<00:01:43.630> because<00:01:44.139> we

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
like that so it's shorter because we

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.440 
like that so it's shorter because we
want<00:01:44.499> the<00:01:44.619> bottom<00:01:45.009> wing<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.789> be<00:01:45.909> shorter<00:01:46.420> than

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
want the bottom wing to be shorter than

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.090 
want the bottom wing to be shorter than
the<00:01:46.659> toppling<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.409> we're<00:01:47.499> shortening<00:01:47.889> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
the toppling so we're shortening the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.699 
the toppling so we're shortening the
sponge<00:01:48.369> by<00:01:48.609> bending<00:01:48.999> it<00:01:49.329> in<00:01:49.420> half<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:50.109> that

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
sponge by bending it in half and that

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.379 
sponge by bending it in half and that
also<00:01:50.979> it's<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.459> to<00:01:51.520> create<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.819> really<00:01:52.209> nice

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
also it's going to create a really nice

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:57.599 
also it's going to create a really nice
curve<00:01:53.049> for<00:01:53.709> the<00:01:53.740> bottom<00:01:54.159> wing<00:01:54.369> 20<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.579> be

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
curve for the bottom wing 20 this can be

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:04.520 
curve for the bottom wing 20 this can be
tricky<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.969> like<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.630 

and<00:02:05.530> bring<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.460> back<00:02:08.099> towards<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.190> other

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
and bring it back towards the other

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
and bring it back towards the other
corner<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.119> your<00:02:10.239> eye<00:02:16.080> okay<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.379> that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
corner of your eye okay so it's that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.920 
corner of your eye okay so it's that
easy<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.670> line<00:02:18.879> is<00:02:19.090> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.330> go<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
easy the line is going to go from the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.550 
easy the line is going to go from the
corner<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.319> eye<00:02:20.760> round<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.239> round<00:02:22.930> wing<00:02:23.290> round

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
corner of eye round a round wing round

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.610 
corner of eye round a round wing round
out<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:24.640> come<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:25.120> at<00:02:25.599> this<00:02:25.930> corner<00:02:26.319> so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
out and then come up at this corner so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.850 
out and then come up at this corner so
it's<00:02:26.800> round<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:27.489> up<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.420> both<00:02:28.870> start<00:02:29.590> in

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
it's round and then up so both start in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.670 
it's round and then up so both start in
your<00:02:30.489> inner<00:02:30.670> corner<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.299> end<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.500> outer

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
your inner corner and end and the outer

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.039 
your inner corner and end and the outer
go<00:02:32.890> ahead<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.760> same<00:02:33.970> thing<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.569> this

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
go ahead and do the same thing on this

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.690 
go ahead and do the same thing on this
part<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.680> make<00:02:35.830> any<00:02:35.980> little<00:02:36.280> mistakes

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
part so if you make any little mistakes

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
easy way to clean that up is to take a

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.420 
easy way to clean that up is to take a
wet<00:02:42.340> wipe<00:02:42.489> before<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.209> fully<00:02:43.720> dries<00:02:43.989> and
