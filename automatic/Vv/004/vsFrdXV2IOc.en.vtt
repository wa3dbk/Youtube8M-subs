today we're looking at the Lamborghini
Gallardo<00:00:04.520> which<00:00:05.520> has<00:00:05.730> now<00:00:05.970> gotten<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.919> circuit

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
Gallardo which has now gotten a circuit

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.370 
Gallardo which has now gotten a circuit
spec<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.300> course<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.690> had<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.900> take<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.170> look

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
spec so of course I had to take a look

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.770 
spec so of course I had to take a look
at<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.120> I<00:00:12.120> loved<00:00:12.420> it

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
at it and I loved it

at it and I loved it
just<00:00:13.590> look<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> color<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.890> have<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
just look at the color of it I have to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.560 
just look at the color of it I have to
say<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> best-looking<00:00:18.330> cars

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
say this is one of the best-looking cars

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.950 
say this is one of the best-looking cars
I<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.289> game<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.770> now<00:00:20.689> it's<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
I have in game right now it's not the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
I have in game right now it's not the
fastest<00:00:22.439> no<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.449> damn<00:00:24.779> cool<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:26.250> it's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
fastest no but it's damn cool and it's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
fastest no but it's damn cool and it's
now<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:27.320> favorite<00:00:28.320> circuit<00:00:28.680> car<00:00:30.320> as<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.529> can

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
now my favorite circuit car as you can

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
now my favorite circuit car as you can
see<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:32.219> no<00:00:32.460> problem<00:00:33.390> getting<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
see it has no problem getting up to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.200 
see it has no problem getting up to
speed

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
speed

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160 
speed
no<00:00:36.210> problem<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:38.690> let's<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.989> goes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
no problem at all let's see how it goes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.560 
no problem at all let's see how it goes
down<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> optimal<00:00:42.420> place

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
down here this is not the optimal place

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.110 
down here this is not the optimal place
to<00:00:42.809> test<00:00:43.020> high<00:00:43.230> speed<00:00:43.469> too<00:00:44.250> many<00:00:44.460> corners<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
to test high speed too many corners and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.290 
to test high speed too many corners and
too<00:00:45.239> many<00:00:45.360> cars<00:00:46.520> yeah<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> check<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
too many cars yeah you can check the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.520 
too many cars yeah you can check the
specs<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> first

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
specs of it first

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.170 
specs of it first
before<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.760> anything<00:00:51.059> else<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:53.180> 938

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
before we do anything else it's got 938

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.849 
before we do anything else it's got 938
brake<00:00:54.660> horsepower<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.430> 943<00:00:56.430> torque<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
brake horsepower and 943 torque which is

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
brake horsepower and 943 torque which is
which<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.489> car<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.390> got

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
which is good for this car it's it's got

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
which is good for this car it's it's got
almost<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.800> much<00:01:02.190> horsepower<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:04.250> murciélago

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
almost as much horsepower as murciélago

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.700 
almost as much horsepower as murciélago
which<00:01:05.670> got<00:01:06.650> 1,001<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:09.439> it's<00:01:10.439> fast<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.950> strong

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
which got 1,001 so it's fast it's strong

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
which got 1,001 so it's fast it's strong
better<00:01:13.710> fastest<00:01:14.159> running<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
better fastest running you know that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.600 
better fastest running you know that
song<00:01:16.400> okay<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> little

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
song okay let's take it for a little

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.249 
song okay let's take it for a little
high-speed<00:01:20.610> chase<00:01:20.880> shall<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.550 

this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> best<00:01:25.710> place<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.920> straight<00:01:29.310> on

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
this is the best place it's straight on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.130 
this is the best place it's straight on
it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.770> place<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> test<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.020> often<00:01:34.020> use

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's a good place to test it I often use

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's a good place to test it I often use
it<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.070> may<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.220> seen<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.299> have

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it as you may have seen if you you have

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.170 
it as you may have seen if you you have
watched<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:37.070> other<00:01:38.070> videos<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> crew<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.789 

don't<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.560> speed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
don't know if you can get any top speed

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.709 
don't know if you can get any top speed
results<00:01:47.280> here

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
results here

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:55.210 
results here
we<00:01:49.049> might<00:01:49.289> or<00:01:49.950> might<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:51.390> wait<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:51.749> await

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.399 

 and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.630 

okay<00:02:00.710> maybe<00:02:00.979> after<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.740> little<00:02:03.740> hill<00:02:03.920> yeah<00:02:04.399> I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
okay maybe after this little hill yeah I

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.370 
okay maybe after this little hill yeah I
think<00:02:04.969> after<00:02:05.119> this<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:05.749> do<00:02:05.899> it

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.339 

oh<00:02:10.410> yes<00:02:11.400> SSS<00:02:12.120> resistor

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
oh yes SSS resistor

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.120 
oh yes SSS resistor
way<00:02:14.890> elements

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.570 

422<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.860> was<00:02:24.070> hard<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.340> tell

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
422 I think it was it was hard to tell

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.630 
422 I think it was it was hard to tell
because<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:25.090> had<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.330> turn<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:26.160> await<00:02:27.160> some

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
because I had to turn to await some

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:38.830 
because I had to turn to await some
scars<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.620> good<00:02:29.800> ones<00:02:30.010> for<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:34.600> least<00:02:34.810> 4<00:02:35.560> 20

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.470 

that's<00:02:39.440> good<00:02:39.650> but<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> important<00:02:41.090> part<00:02:41.270> here

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that's good but the important part here

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.059 
that's good but the important part here
is<00:02:42.250> decided<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:44.690> has<00:02:44.840> no<00:02:45.170> problem<00:02:45.650> getting<00:02:45.830> up

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
is decided it has no problem getting up

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.670 
is decided it has no problem getting up
to<00:02:46.280> 400<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:46.970> its<00:02:47.150> own<00:02:47.300> without<00:02:48.020> using<00:02:48.560> anything

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
to 400 on its own without using anything

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.839 
to 400 on its own without using anything
else<00:02:50.770> can't<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.980> here's<00:02:52.190> too<00:02:52.459> many<00:02:52.610> corners

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
else can't do it here's too many corners

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.080 
else can't do it here's too many corners
but<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.360> saw<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.650> saw<00:02:55.840> yeah<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.870> know

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
enter sit down here I'm gonna test it
