00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
with the other sneakers if you didn't

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.030 
with the other sneakers if you didn't
own<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.770> before<00:02:11.129> check<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.270> other<00:02:12.390> brands

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
own one before check your other brands

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280 
own one before check your other brands
this<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.579> uh<00:02:13.610> they're<00:02:14.450> mostly<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:15.049> like

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this and uh they're mostly going like

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
this and uh they're mostly going like
the<00:02:15.439> same<00:02:15.650> sizes<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.670> others<00:02:16.939> it's<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.239> true

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the same sizes the others it's a true

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.899 
the same sizes the others it's a true
fit<00:02:17.719> and<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.829> grip<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.189> the<00:02:19.340> Contra<00:02:19.670> grip

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
fit and the grip is the Contra grip

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.839 
fit and the grip is the Contra grip
there's<00:02:20.689> nothing<00:02:21.049> different<00:02:21.230> with<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:21.590> grip

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
there's nothing different with the grip

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.509 
there's nothing different with the grip
it's<00:02:22.849> still<00:02:23.030> pretty<00:02:23.239> aggressive<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.109> think<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
it's still pretty aggressive I think the

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.369 
it's still pretty aggressive I think the
only<00:02:25.700> difference<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.269> can<00:02:26.299> see<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.870> they're<00:02:27.349> a

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
only difference I can see is they're a

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.520 
only difference I can see is they're a
little<00:02:27.650> thicker<00:02:28.010> right<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.900> know<00:02:30.170> they

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
little thicker right here you know they

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.670 
little thicker right here you know they
have<00:02:30.739> these<00:02:30.890> splits<00:02:31.640> versus<00:02:32.480> them<00:02:33.409> being

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
have these splits versus them being

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.250 
have these splits versus them being
really<00:02:34.519> solid<00:02:34.909> grips<00:02:35.150> right<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.720> speed

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
really solid grips right on the speed

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.380 
really solid grips right on the speed
cross<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.849> see<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.359> are

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
cross so you can see that there are

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.899 
cross so you can see that there are
splits<00:02:38.870> over<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:39.560> which<00:02:39.769> probably<00:02:40.370> if

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
splits over there so which probably if

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.069 
splits over there so which probably if
you<00:02:41.060> put<00:02:41.239> enough<00:02:41.450> weight<00:02:41.599> they're<00:02:41.870> going<00:02:42.019> to

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
you put enough weight they're going to

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.649 
you put enough weight they're going to
split<00:02:42.409> and<00:02:42.590> grab<00:02:42.769> much<00:02:43.010> better<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:44.209> one<00:02:44.450> thing

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
split and grab much better and one thing

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.319 
split and grab much better and one thing
I<00:02:44.810> realized<00:02:45.590> when<00:02:45.889> I<00:02:45.920> wear<00:02:46.189> these<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:47.060> more

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
I realized when I wear these I have more

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.690 
I realized when I wear these I have more
support<00:02:47.720> outside<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.590> shoe<00:02:48.829> left<00:02:49.489> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
support outside of the shoe left and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520 
support outside of the shoe left and
right<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.239> shoe<00:02:50.480> doesn't<00:02:50.870> move<00:02:51.049> like<00:02:51.079> left

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
right so the shoe doesn't move like left

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.349 
right so the shoe doesn't move like left
and<00:02:51.680> right<00:02:51.769> when<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.159> hit<00:02:52.669> my<00:02:52.879> feet<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.239> the

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
and right when I hit my feet on the

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.720 
and right when I hit my feet on the
ground<00:02:53.569> I'm<00:02:53.750> solid<00:02:54.290> over<00:02:54.500> there<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.099> can<00:02:55.280> tell

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
ground I'm solid over there you can tell

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.119 
ground I'm solid over there you can tell
that<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.510> got<00:02:56.689> more<00:02:56.930> ankle<00:02:57.319> support<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
that you got more ankle support all the

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.429 
that you got more ankle support all the
way<00:02:58.220> around<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.639> feet<00:02:58.849> coming<00:02:59.810> down<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.319> the

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
way around the feet coming down to the

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.710 
way around the feet coming down to the
toe<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.889> year<00:03:01.099> as<00:03:01.730> far<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.239> front<00:03:02.450> goes

view obviously the ties are the same you
just<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:18.799> quick<00:03:19.760> tie<00:03:19.970> them<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.299> then<00:03:21.019> tuck

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
just like quick tie them and then tuck

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.360 
just like quick tie them and then tuck
it<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.500> into<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:23.019> lace<00:03:24.019> right<00:03:24.319> here<00:03:24.560> into<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it up into the lace right here into the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.780 
it up into the lace right here into the
turn<00:03:25.849> of<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> share<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:27.190> inside<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.370> still

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
turn of the share and inside is still

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.030 
turn of the share and inside is still
ortholite<00:03:29.449> both<00:03:30.199> of<00:03:30.290> them<00:03:30.409> are<00:03:30.560> ortho<00:03:30.859> lights

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
ortholite both of them are ortho lights

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.969 
ortholite both of them are ortho lights
so<00:03:31.540> nothing<00:03:32.540> has<00:03:32.659> changed<00:03:32.989> inside<00:03:33.169> the<00:03:33.500> shoe<00:03:33.769> I

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
so nothing has changed inside the shoe I

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.890 
so nothing has changed inside the shoe I
usually<00:03:34.639> don't<00:03:34.970> mess<00:03:35.209> with<00:03:35.239> them<00:03:35.629> they're

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
usually don't mess with them they're

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.199 
usually don't mess with them they're
really<00:03:36.079> light<00:03:36.500> plus<00:03:37.250> they<00:03:37.729> give<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:37.970> lot<00:03:38.180> of

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
really light plus they give a lot of

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.750 
really light plus they give a lot of
support<00:03:38.659> so<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:39.169> really<00:03:39.859> didn't<00:03:40.129> feel<00:03:40.250> need<00:03:40.549> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
support so I really didn't feel need to
