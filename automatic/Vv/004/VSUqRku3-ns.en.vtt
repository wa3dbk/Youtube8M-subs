00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.780
 Many people do not even realize that the landing of astronauts on the moon was predicted more than 1,400 years ago ... 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.040
 in the Holy Quran 

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:15.928
 The module of astronauts broke away from the surface of the moon with a cargo of moon stones on board at 1 hour, 54 minutes and 1 second in the North American eastern time zone 

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:19.248
 At the same time, there are 25 time zones in the world. 

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:24.034
 In which the HOUR depends on the time zone in which you live 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.380
 Therefore, to be more precise ... 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 and not take into account the hour, which varies depending on the time zone 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.380
 there are only 53 minutes and 1 second - 54: 1 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.200
 "The Hour Approached and the Month Splintered" (54 surah, 1 ayah of the Holy Quran) 

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:46.366
 At this point, the astronauts left the moon with 21 kilograms of lunar stones. 

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:51.485
 The moon landing took place on July 20, 1969, on the solar calendar. 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 It is noteworthy that from the verse "The Hour is Near and the Month Split" (54: 1) 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.120
 to the end of the Quran ... 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.060
 1389 ayahs 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380
 1389th lunar year 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 equals 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.980
 1969 according to the Gregorian calendar! (Year of landing on the moon) 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.700
 Only the Almighty Allah, who knows everything in advance, could send down the Book, in which subsequent historical events ... 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.300
 reflected before they happen 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 We have already sent you a Scripture that contains a reminder of you. Do you not understand? (21 ayah, 10 sura 

00:01:53.317 --> 00:02:03.297
 54: 1 The hour came, and the moon divided. 54: 2 And although they see a sign, they leave and say: "This is strong magic." 54: 3 They considered these instructions to be false and went on the trail of their desires, but every event is immutable. 

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:08.751
 54: 2 And although they see the sign ... 

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:13.871
 This amazing fact became known 5 years after the manâ€™s flight to the moon. 

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:17.671
 But most do not realize the wonders around us. 

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.031
 The Most High tells us ... 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.760
 3:51 Verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship him: this is the direct path. "
