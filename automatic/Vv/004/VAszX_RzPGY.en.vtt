there's a piece on the bottom and the
top<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.060> sort<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> keeps<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> together<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.409> if

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
top that sort of keeps it together so if

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490 
top that sort of keeps it together so if
you<00:01:10.590> were<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> drop<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.970> wouldn't<00:01:12.840> fall

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you were to drop it it wouldn't fall

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
you were to drop it it wouldn't fall
now<00:01:13.770> however<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.640> still<00:01:14.670> able<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> dock

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
now however you're still able to dock

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.810 
now however you're still able to dock
this<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.470> easily<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.229> there

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
this very easily as you can see there

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.100 
this very easily as you can see there
even<00:01:20.820> though<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.090> able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> dock<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
even though you are able to dock this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.359 
even though you are able to dock this
very<00:01:22.680> easily<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> requires<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> lot<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.830> force

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
very easily it requires a lot of force

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
very easily it requires a lot of force
to<00:01:26.700> take<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.780> iPhone<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to take this off of the iPhone and that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
to take this off of the iPhone and that
means<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> were<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> drop<00:01:31.170> your

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
means that if you were to drop your

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.760 
means that if you were to drop your
iPhone<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.640> piece<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.299> stand<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.530> front

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
iPhone this piece would stand the front

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
iPhone this piece would stand the front
of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> case<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> lip<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.390> protection

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of the case has a lip for protection

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.109 
of the case has a lip for protection
right<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> were<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> drop<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
right here so if you were to drop it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.620 
right here so if you were to drop it
face<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.229> most<00:01:40.740> likely<00:01:41.420> spare<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
face down it would most likely spare the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.249 
face down it would most likely spare the
screen<00:01:43.079> from<00:01:43.770> shattering<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.659> sides<00:01:45.930> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
screen from shattering on the sides we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.880 
screen from shattering on the sides we
have<00:01:46.290> two<00:01:46.920> volume<00:01:47.460> rockers<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:49.170> silent

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
have two volume rockers and your silent

have two volume rockers and your silent
vibrate<00:01:50.310> switch<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.909> problem<00:01:51.299> I've<00:01:51.450> had<00:01:51.479> with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
vibrate switch one problem I've had with

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.660 
vibrate switch one problem I've had with
this<00:01:51.930> case<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.990> difficult

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
this case is that it is very difficult

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.899 
this case is that it is very difficult
to<00:01:56.670> switch<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.079> silent<00:01:58.770> mode<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to switch this to silent mode as you can

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.149 
to switch this to silent mode as you can

the<00:02:04.380> capability<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.299> switching<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> silent

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the capability of switching it to silent

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.100 
the capability of switching it to silent
mode<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:07.920> pinkie<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:09.110> really

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
mode and even with my pinkie I really

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
mode and even with my pinkie I really
just<00:02:10.259> can't<00:02:10.590> switch<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.330> sometimes<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.510> just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just can't switch that sometimes I just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.380 
just can't switch that sometimes I just
have<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> push

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
have to push

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
have to push
harder<00:02:13.660> really<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.680> gets<00:02:14.860> there<00:02:15.100> so

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
harder really down and it gets there so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.740 
harder really down and it gets there so
it<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> little<00:02:15.970> bit<00:02:16.090> difficult<00:02:16.270> especially

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it is a little bit difficult especially

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.660 
it is a little bit difficult especially
if<00:02:17.170> you're<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> situation<00:02:17.590> where<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.550> want

however turning the phone off of silent
is<00:02:23.110> very<00:02:23.440> easy<00:02:23.709> as<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.490> see<00:02:24.730> there's<00:02:24.940> more
