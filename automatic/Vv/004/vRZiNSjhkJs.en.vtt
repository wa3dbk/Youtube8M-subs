00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.380

 perch special on their porn 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.660
 special food 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 if it is in the heat and that he can not 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.810
 to fly 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.869
 if he doesnâ€™t have them 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 corner by translation 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 when people come to him memory is not 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.880
 remembers the speech they say here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.670
 but 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.640
 there are only legs so he 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.560
 replaces your circle the whole bow happens 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.570
 different varieties of macaw 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.969
 and I saw them cartoons called this 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 but flowed it there is such a multi where them 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.170
 as many as 38 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.900
 our rainbow world still has no pet 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 I think it 's time to get one of 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:13.640
 we will first ask them in adults how 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.310
 they care hello guys what 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 we are interested in a parrot until years to 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.240
 throwing away the budgeries very 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.370
 afraid of frost and afraid of catching cold 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.250
 so at home 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.890
 so that there is a little bit and no 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.280
 drafts and vents to be closed 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.010
 what you need to feed the parrots and always and 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.830
 should be in a cage eat no water 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.830
 should have good food and water should be 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.060
 always in a cage how to distinguish a parrot and 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.180
 parrot boy estrus over boy 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.570
 beak but the joints should be blue 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.900
 colors and the girl has great roses 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.470
 a pair of parrots can live together the whole 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 life but how much they are destined to live 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.120
 together they will always be together and will 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.750
 always porn and and there will be a family 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.270
 why the parrot hides bite under the wing 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.610
 if he is cold he is so hot he 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:25.180
 hides beak covered wing and 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.180
 warms up inside 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.790
 rainbow guys decided to have a parrot 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.990
