00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.469
 the formula in 2010 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.959
 And what a top movie of this masters game sells is that they are for it 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.239
 first actually 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:18.220
 However in yes an arcaderacer and would have used to make a game a formula 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 to make a sign that the promotions are really breeding fat 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.900
 you may want to live for it 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.940
 who they are 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.930
 but just not very good at the game but it is just everything 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.250
 the moving car not only around the wheel and on the grass 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 after that of course not to approve but if you go i dont do this here and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.220
 a special one there 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 And yes just go make this game 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.180
 that they are committed 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.450
 the kubber may come 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.970
 The newspaper says critical mass or you are going to notice this year 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.200
 jacks and 30 year old trainer 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.920
 what is that of course you have to start 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.699
 always with a bad old hour anyone can start a ferrari yes you 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.730
 bad car and that car does not have the pull 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.250
 I also noticed that for his team that wasn't 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.260
 because first during the first race in china max may be eighth with one 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.810
 force india the chosen 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.770
 because with his motorcycle utrecht he is pretty good if you all 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.370
 he helped expand then you really notice that your car is not about to steer but you have to 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.860
 just knows how to fascinate you 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.980
 according to iris that the shortest race distance you can drive 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.860
 she is 20 percent of the children are ten laps including a pit stop 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.010
 but that is not what I can no longer remember with other games such as the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.170
 the freedom i can't do it well i could sit in my first race 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.240
 so I had to miss a hpc sprint through that whole hurdle 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.460
 when i really had a huge hole from sunday to monday it was tricky but the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 back of the peloton in the front 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.159
 well you have to do some laps and close jumbo jet bye 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.429
 just a crucial day to come but never expected that i got it right away 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.530
 to become 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.010
 then went 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.170
 sneak peak someone a little too much as every block in nl 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 the temporary bet a penalty 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 or you must see this 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240
 the ns 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.400
 in short, if that is to be avoided, the black flag has 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.099
 we have to make this murder harder 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.800
 and you are really used to it 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.190
 the aggression of the van de hull and the drivers against whom the driver is driving 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.770
 which differs the one is up to safe 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.369
 then that is the bollard seen 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.409
 the real thing following on the cart to all critics' critics 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.149
 load 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.180
 he gets a try 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.060
 make the area a lot of terrain 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.510
 makes it really hard for you to catch up on a soft spot 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.510
 at sparta but at a given moment and an app for a job 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.519
 I felt 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.189
 the assumption that things did not go well with the stubbornness of the coins 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.819
 it was going to rain a lot 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.870
 chain store that this type of thing comes up for a full day that kind of choices 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.469
 you can really do it all 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.779
 yes, almost an hour and a half of racing, you already know how there is 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.149
 it just comes against the man himself, I think 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.309
 And yes, I think so too 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.499
 for more wages the enthusiasts 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.879
 want to become creemers 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.979
 he just wanted to drive as it should 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.289
 just neatly keep the line if you notice 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.110
 before someone comes after you 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.520
 a faster one are you who are going to cut a bp bend year we are just making up 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.529
 the place where you go 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:21.359
 no this is this is going to the final then you still go and the summer a lot I hope 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.419
 it very much to see what this is a game 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.669
 who not only try to mood in the newspaper friends 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.460
 very extensive 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.069
 just completely play that guy out then 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.739
 start playing multiplayer 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.099
 And yes problem is that now you actually just play 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.150
 with sports week 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.320
 created by 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.589
 the experience they have gained with the most enthusiastic guides and 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.509
 it belongs 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.239
 because they translate into that henin formula 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.559
 have bought series licenses in short 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.689
 all those aspects do not think sitting a seat so that balance between 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.269
 that it must have the challenge 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.659
 it's not about difficulty plot difficulty it's about tub days in it 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.979
 the point is that you are really running 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.810
 That is me myself in these people also time to see his review 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.479
 at a few points in game kings the way the cars open 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.890
 You know most people feel like a DJ who is already from Freiburg 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.850
 here simply those who weigh those deacons sixth floor of much less 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.380
 good handling have the same every turn you a little they had some 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.000
 helps or if I sat in a row with close behind because he got a bit through it 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.280
 ribbon went i could go hard i died she starts on the tape again
