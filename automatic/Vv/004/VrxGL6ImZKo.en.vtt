00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
Bluetooth signal doesn't take that long

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
Bluetooth signal doesn't take that long
to<00:01:23.970> transfer<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> once<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.530> transfer

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
to transfer and once it does transfer

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
to transfer and once it does transfer
rather<00:01:26.520> than<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.150> having<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.450> input<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
rather than you having to input a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
rather than you having to input a
password<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.710> sensor<00:01:28.979> detects<00:01:29.310> vibrations

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
password the sensor detects vibrations

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
password the sensor detects vibrations
and<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.869> unlocks<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.439> computer<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> that's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and it unlocks your computer and that's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
and it unlocks your computer and that's
basically<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.720> there's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
basically all there is to it there's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
basically all there is to it there's
nothing<00:01:34.110> else<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.799> works<00:01:35.310> almost

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
nothing else it works almost

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
nothing else it works almost
consistently<00:01:36.270> almost<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> hundred<00:01:36.900> percent<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
consistently almost a hundred percent of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
consistently almost a hundred percent of
the<00:01:37.380> time<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.979> which<00:01:38.549> isn't<00:01:38.700> really

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the time and which isn't really

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
the time and which isn't really
impressive<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.799> bluetooth<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
impressive because bluetooth is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
impressive because bluetooth is
sometimes<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> non<00:01:42.030> reliable<00:01:42.570> technology<00:01:42.890> but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
sometimes a non reliable technology but

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.429 
sometimes a non reliable technology but
in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> case<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.549> Bluetooth<00:01:45.000> 4.0<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in the case of Bluetooth 4.0 which is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.859 
in the case of Bluetooth 4.0 which is
quite<00:01:46.649> new<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.369> only<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.119> 2011<00:01:48.810> or

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
greater macbook pros it's quite

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
greater macbook pros it's quite
impressive<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> asked<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
impressive if you asked me and I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
impressive if you asked me and I
definitely<00:01:53.159> recommend<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.700> application

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
for only four dollars it certainly

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.160 
for only four dollars it certainly

unlock your computer which is why I

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.420 
unlock your computer which is why I
recommend<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.409> keep<00:03:25.799> your<00:03:25.859> phone<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
recommend that you keep your phone to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.670 
recommend that you keep your phone to
yourself<00:03:26.819> but<00:03:27.419> if<00:03:27.479> that<00:03:27.689> doesn't<00:03:27.720> work<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:28.319> I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
yourself but if that doesn't work out I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.050 
yourself but if that doesn't work out I
think<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.099> developer<00:03:29.549> should<00:03:29.579> work<00:03:29.849> on<00:03:29.939> a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
think the developer should work on a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.580 
think the developer should work on a
feature<00:03:30.299> where<00:03:30.629> this<00:03:30.810> doesn't<00:03:31.109> work<00:03:31.319> unless

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
feature where this doesn't work unless

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.830 
feature where this doesn't work unless
your<00:03:31.919> phone<00:03:32.099> is<00:03:32.250> unlocked<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.689> set

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
your phone is unlocked and you can set

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.599 
your phone is unlocked and you can set
up<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.989> passcode<00:03:34.379> on<00:03:34.439> your<00:03:34.620> phone<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:35.370> this

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
up a passcode on your phone so this

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.030 
up a passcode on your phone so this
issue<00:03:35.849> will<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.239> rendered<00:03:36.810> gone<00:03:37.199> in<00:03:37.590> terms<00:03:37.919> of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
issue will be rendered gone in terms of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.399 
issue will be rendered gone in terms of
Technology<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:39.299> utilizes<00:03:39.930> something

Technology this utilizes something

twice<00:04:27.849> and<00:04:28.150> I'm<00:04:28.240> done<00:04:28.539> so<00:04:29.080> yes<00:04:29.319> this<00:04:29.500> is

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
twice and I'm done so yes this is

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.010 
twice and I'm done so yes this is
definitely<00:04:30.069> a<00:04:30.099> cool<00:04:30.400> app<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.509> think<00:04:31.930> it

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
definitely a cool app and I think it

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.480 
definitely a cool app and I think it
deserves<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.620> number<00:04:32.889> one<00:04:33.039> spot<00:04:33.430> for

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
deserves the number one spot for

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.659 
deserves the number one spot for
utilities<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.750> unfortunately<00:04:35.710> for<00:04:36.189> mac<00:04:36.370> only

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
utilities and unfortunately for mac only

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.640 
utilities and unfortunately for mac only
currently<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.689> it's<00:04:38.050> only<00:04:38.199> for<00:04:38.289> people<00:04:38.590> who

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
currently and it's only for people who

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.309

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.499 
have a 2011 a Mac or greater which is
one<00:04:41.740> reason<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.849> think<00:04:43.210> someone<00:04:43.479> should

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
one reason that I think someone should

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.140 
one reason that I think someone should
upgrade<00:04:43.780> this<00:04:44.409> is<00:04:44.620> cool<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.610> developer

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
upgrade this is cool and the developer

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.939 
upgrade this is cool and the developer
should<00:04:46.180> focus<00:04:46.599> on<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.289> updating<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.889> a

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
should focus on just updating it a

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.740 
should focus on just updating it a
little<00:04:48.069> bit<00:04:48.219> more<00:04:48.430> its<00:04:48.939> own<00:04:49.060> version<00:04:49.509> of<00:04:49.569> one

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
little bit more its own version of one

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.899 
little bit more its own version of one
point<00:04:49.960> no<00:04:50.020> point<00:04:50.050> 1<00:04:50.560> keep<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.189> in<00:04:51.310> mind<00:04:51.550> this

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909
