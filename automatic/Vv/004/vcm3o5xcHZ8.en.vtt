 five types of foods that help the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 production of collagen and elastin the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 Collagen and elastin are two proteins 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.190
 who work hand in hand on the body 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 to give connective tissues their 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.440
 structure the collagen gives the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.560
 body tissues firmness while 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 elastin gives them flexibility 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.640
 when people start to get old 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.060
 their bodies begin to produce less 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.099
 amount of these proteins the collagen 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 is an essential protein for a skin 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.649
 Soft healthy and young children are more 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 collagen that adults that's why that

 the skin looks smooth and wrinkle-free 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 naturally the elastin is another 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 protein that helps maintain the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.149
 skin elasticity consume 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.610
 Foods rich in collagen and elastin 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.829
 helps to keep these proteins in the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 body and keep the skin smooth with the

 they provide lutein which helps 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.719
 increase elastin in the skin 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 increasing its elasticity vegetables 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 they contain vitamin C a vitamin 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.579
 important 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.759
 helps these proteins work in 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.090
 the body properly mainly

 substance that besides being a good 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 antioxidant contributes to the creation of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.299
 collagen is mainly contained in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420

 positive to increase production 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.689
 of collagen eat frequently

 ideal environment for the production of 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.920
 collagen if you are vegetarian you 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.599
 you can still get the same acids
