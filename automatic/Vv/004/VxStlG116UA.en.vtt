00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 vague brothers of minecraft ita mod io 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.480
 I am a piece and today I am here for 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.320
 survey the acres for spices mod 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.090
 let's start right away but let's see what 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 this introduces us this new fashion 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.330
 new fashion introduces us to new types of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.250
 creeper in minecraft as you see now 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 I too am surprised because you look 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 guys what's this stuff is an inter 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.920
 already at the wheel that doesn't make sense for though 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.219
 it's really beautiful so why me 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 like a lot especially ichri why 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.410
 they added one in particular because 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 it's very nice they added these 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 new three types of creeper then the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 strengthened clipper let's call it such a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.860
 little more defensive than the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.649
 others for but it is very nice for the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.420
 kickback texture should already be 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.829
 dead but you see that he is very resistant 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 and I will do no more harm my god 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.899
 practically destroyed everything does nothing 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 now I do revise when he dies 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 dies what too much now we try to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.720
 don't take the year 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.880
 ok then he did not even notice 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.490
 that of the burst ces pair of blow 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 without even making you see that you are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 preparing to burst 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.960
 and much of here was much more 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.140
 experience compared to the normal creeper e 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 will have a drop around one percent of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.229
 drop one object into another diamond 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.720
 the clipper they introduced is the pic i 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 lazy because according to another cute of 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 not all the meat is always there 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.600
 very rare that too many meats however like 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.049
 you saw the meat stolen though 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 also this creeper as in the end it is 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.079
 a creeper because look here is indeed 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.229
 skopje but instead of doing damage like 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.710
 the earlier clipper that you have 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.439
 saw it made a deep hole 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.170
 this kind of creeper will make it a hole 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.270
 in fact width as you see the vote 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.610
 this, however, is wider as you see more 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.730
 deep but also very wide because it has 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 watched destroyed practically everything 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.599
 the last clipper that this fashion 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.670
 introduces is the dragonfly clipper 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.099
 they called it so it will have this texture 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
 gold color and will not explode 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.870
 it is in the air it will not be able to explode 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.810
 so it's the easiest clipper to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.760
 find and almost never explodes let's say 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.769
 unless it's on the ground and it's a lot 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.830
 easy to kill too much experience 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.840
 like a normal creeper then guys 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.819
 that's all it adds 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.890
 this new fashion that we see at a 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.959
 next video remember to put me 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.830
