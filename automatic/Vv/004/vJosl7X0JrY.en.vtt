00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.040
 Y 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.940
 that for friends of the woman program to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.770
 woman two generations in the first 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.470
 months of the year we change clothes 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.510
 and the accessories and how to invest little 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.119
 but winning a lot is about today I bring you 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.310
 the advice to use a necklace not only from 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.359
 several ways but also to use it 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 as a belt 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 let's see our project today 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.550
 We are going to use ribbons pieces of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.519
 putter or plastic in silver color 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 acrylic rings if you want crystals 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.059
 the materials that you have in 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 house plus some pieces like these 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.059
 also to decorate and these links 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 of chains 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.579
 cut in sizes that you want 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.800
 give your design 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:05.320
 the first thing then will be to use a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.320
 piece of nylon and enter 7 beads 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 we will use celestial tones 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.880
 but you remember that I can do it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.890
 in black in red or if you want it for a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.190
 basic dress can also do it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.110
 only in silver and as you like 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.650
 I also recommend them to use colors 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 basic like blue gray the black these 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.220
 which are used in offices as 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.050
 uniforms because we remember that our 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 Customers can also be in 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.730
 advertising agencies in banks in 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.650
 any kind of office so you 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.140
 make your accessories so that they can 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.660
 combine them with the uniforms and so 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.060
 give them a different touch every day and not 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.120
 feel bored of using the same 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.380
 attire you have to remove the monotony every 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.600
 one of the days 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 when we have introduced the seven 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 we're just going to tie up in a way 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.399
 that remains strong or resistant and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.560
 We cut threads so we leftover 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:18.000
 let's do four pieces just like 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:20.700
 this step is to place in a 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.140
 Hook the chain pieces that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.019
 we had already cut 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 we look for the center or something close to 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.209
 center so that we stay a little 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.470
 capricious and after introducing the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.269
 three pieces we are going to close again 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 well it is well dita so that we do not know 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.739
 come out then we 're going to 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.739
 put in an end with hoop 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 we close well and follow our piece 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.730
 silver 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.330
 there is already this we are not going to cut 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 the excess because we're going to leave it as 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.930
 safe possible by giving it several turns 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.880
 with the thickest of the pliers so that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.600
 we are big 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.590
 the ring there is this what we 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.310
 missing now connect let's use 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.730
 this piece of ribbon and we fold it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.940
 we are going to tie it in the center 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.480
 with another thread we call it from 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.040
 cellular because well thin but 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.530
 resistant as the center here now I see 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:48.019
 everything is even I make a small 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:52.879
 knot like that and I start to place other 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:56.920
 beads with balines and that are of the same 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.920
 color of the rings we made 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.110
 let's go placing a light blue 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.150
 separated by silver 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.150
 according to the water we want to give 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.050
 when we have finished spinning the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.129
 accounts let's do the knot in the other 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.750
 always in the center 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.260
 here 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.760
 let's do the number 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.760
 we will cut only what is necessary 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.080
 and we fix them well 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.900
 we greet in the inside to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.380
 that by folding the bar you do not notice the 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.380
 knot 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.219
 because we are doing it that way 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.759
 important that if you are going to use a 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:02.619
 accessory as belt is very resistant 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.659
 because when you sit down normally 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.029
 does a pressure that can make it 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.820
 you burst the accessory here we have already 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:11.130
 this part 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.760
 now we need to place the others 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.760
 accessories 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.600
 let's match the bar so that 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.340
 tips remain the same 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.340
 and with a ring pin 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.080
 let's do 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.949
 the pendant of the tips 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.230
 we cover the ring end and another ring 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.810
 small is going to serve as support 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.350
 and we burn the ribbon so that we do not get 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.050
 Desile with time 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.810
 Now let's place the others 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.830
 accessories in a linear fashion 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.360
 separating with silver touches 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.460
 contrasting the sky blue with a green with 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.460
 transparent and as you like 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.860
 then this is 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.750
 well and it's going to cover up a bit the sea that 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.550
 we have done 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.550
 here we will make another ring 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.640
 and will help us to hold 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:31.009
 the other accessory that we made with the 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.190
 chains and the silver piece 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.730
 there is 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:49.570
 and the tip of our five and collar to 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:52.030
 the time this way is this wonder I'm going to 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.820
 remove this so they can see how 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:59.400
 We can use if we want it as a necklace 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.400
 we put this ornament in front 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.110
 we match a little and the rest we have left 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.300
 hanging in this way but if you 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.620
 we want how this adornment 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.770
 it is on the side 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:16.180
 and then we're going to do a 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.680
 knot here this is ideal for mailboxes 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.560
 but if we have a carved dress 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.370
 we can also use it 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.370
 up here 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.039
 is to touch it well 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.060
 in this way this is the accessory 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.040
 multifunctional that we talked about 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.980
 You can see here also other 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.690
 options part of the 2014 trend that 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.820
 you can only meet you in the program 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.870
 from woman to woman two generations 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.870
 we see in the next
