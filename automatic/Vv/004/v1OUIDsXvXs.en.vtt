for the remainder of this video I'm
going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.819> talk<00:02:44.910> about<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> gameplay<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.840> I

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
going to talk about the gameplay what I

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.170 
going to talk about the gameplay what I
liked<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.440> yes<00:02:47.220> certainly<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.819> fingers<00:02:48.120> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
liked and yes certainly the fingers I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
liked and yes certainly the fingers I
didn't<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.019> firstly<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.470> shooting<00:02:49.890> if

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
didn't like so firstly the shooting if

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.309 
didn't like so firstly the shooting if
it<00:02:50.400> was<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.519> lot<00:02:50.670> more<00:02:50.760> difficult<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.900> lot

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
it was a lot more difficult but a lot

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.949 
it was a lot more difficult but a lot
more<00:02:52.470> realistic<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:54.030> easy<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.720> score

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
more realistic it's not easy to score

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.809 
more realistic it's not easy to score
goals<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.410> can't<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.769> their<00:02:55.950> aim<00:02:56.190> your

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
goals you can't have their aim your

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.870 
goals you can't have their aim your
shots<00:02:57.150> more<00:02:57.900> than<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.470> had<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> fever<00:02:59.400> 14

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
shots more than you had to a fever 14

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880 
shots more than you had to a fever 14
even<00:03:00.299> powershot<00:03:00.870> seem<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.380> much<00:03:01.590> harder

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
even powershot seem to be much harder

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.160 
even powershot seem to be much harder
score<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> goalkeepers<00:03:03.420> can

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
score from because the goalkeepers can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.800 
score from because the goalkeepers can
be<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.620> opie<00:03:05.010> at<00:03:05.130> times<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.420> way<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.600> go

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
be so opie at times and the way to go

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.350 
be so opie at times and the way to go
for<00:03:06.930> me<00:03:07.110> would<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.590> finessed<00:03:08.160> shots<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.330> I

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
