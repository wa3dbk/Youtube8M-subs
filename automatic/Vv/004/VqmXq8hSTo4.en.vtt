00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
keeping both of these and I'll roll

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.730 
keeping both of these and I'll roll
again<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.679> keeping<00:01:59.130> both<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
again I'm keeping both of these and I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.880 
again I'm keeping both of these and I
rolled<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.280> six<00:02:02.789> on<00:02:02.999> that<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.749> here's<00:02:04.740> what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
rolled a six on that one so here's what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.489 
rolled a six on that one so here's what
I<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.570> if<00:02:06.570> any<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> those<00:02:07.020> combinations

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
I can do if any of those combinations

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.309 
I can do if any of those combinations
would<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.030> let's<00:02:09.240> say<00:02:09.420> this

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
would be up here so let's say this

the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.949 
the
and<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.810> could<00:02:25.200> take<00:02:26.159> that<00:02:26.400> card<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.749> it<00:02:27.780> in

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
and I could take that card and put it in

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.959 
and I could take that card and put it in
my<00:02:28.140> score<00:02:28.469> pile<00:02:28.739> facedown<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.549> could<00:02:29.730> even

in fact take that card and my own

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.839 
in fact take that card and my own
because<00:02:33.719> it's<00:02:33.930> still<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.319> my<00:02:34.499> hand<00:02:34.859> I<00:02:35.189> would

get four points and four point that
would<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.099> great<00:02:38.989> however<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.200> did<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.499> play

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
would be great however they did not play

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.039 
would be great however they did not play
that<00:02:41.010> card<00:02:41.219> they<00:02:41.400> played<00:02:41.639> this<00:02:41.849> one<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.359> since

that card they played this one and since

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
that card they played this one and since
I<00:02:43.230> cannot<00:02:43.560> take<00:02:43.829> any<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.219> those<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.609> then<00:02:44.819> I

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
I cannot take any of those up then I

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.990 
I cannot take any of those up then I
could<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.329> always<00:02:45.599> take<00:02:46.560> something<00:02:47.069> from<00:02:47.700> my

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
could just always take something from my

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.929 
could just always take something from my

next<00:02:51.180> players<00:02:51.450> turn<00:02:51.599> if<00:02:52.109> they<00:02:52.739> roll<00:02:53.239> three

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
next players turn if they roll three

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.429 
next players turn if they roll three
fives<00:02:54.780> let's<00:02:55.319> say<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:56.120> their<00:02:57.120> turn<00:02:57.480> then

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
fives let's say on their turn then

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.080 
fives let's say on their turn then
they'll<00:02:58.620> be<00:02:58.739> able<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.980> snag<00:02:59.340> both<00:02:59.760> these

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
they'll be able to snag both these

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.550 
they'll be able to snag both these
because<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:00.959> both<00:03:01.169> have<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.530> same

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
because they both have the same

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.619 
because they both have the same
combination<00:03:02.840> if<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:04.109> any<00:03:04.290> point<00:03:04.379> there<00:03:05.189> are<00:03:05.629> no

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
combination if at any point there are no

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.449
