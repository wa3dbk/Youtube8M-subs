00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.619
 finally the rain and the landscape cease 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 which in itself was already magical and mysterious 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 acquires a different image thanks to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.349
 the large number of waterfalls that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.349
 they run down the walls of the mountains 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 however for archaeologists the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 done working in areas with high 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.480
 levels of precipitation can 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.649
 represent several problems for example 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 the walls that are not yet 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.019
 fully consolidated can be seen 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.960
 softened by the accumulation of water 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.860
 of rain and derive in the collapse of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860
 some structure 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.050
 this incident captured by my camera does not 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.120
 it was an isolated fact several tens of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.550
 meters below the temple in the area 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.420
 of the terraces a complete segment of the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.030
 wall literally came down without 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.310
 However, this fortuitous event helped the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.470
 archaeologists to understand more about the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.910
 constructive system used for 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.910
 building of the terraces 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.030
 but not all were incidents 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.890
 lucky as far as I'm concerned the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.400
 rains caused me enough 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.410
 problems 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.970
 I am now in the path 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.340
 main this is the way that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.280
 daily workers pass 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.050
 the archeologists and good and I and of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140
 suddenly with the last rains that have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.550
 fallen extract or be the great wish and we 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.440
 they did back but behind my back 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.210
 Right in the middle of the sidewalk 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.670
 find a fallen tree 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 the problem is general that tree 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.300
 stuck there halfway we 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 affects everyone 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.650
 archaeologists visiting workers to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.380
 everyone as friends is his life and 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.760
 recording equipment tripod cameras e 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.740
 even a small crane type 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.470
 cinematic is enough 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.420
 complicated in a medium like this and if you 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.210
 we add the you have to look for a new 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 climb route 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.690
 definitely the solution is to clear 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.690
 the main road 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.470
 finally finish cutting the branch but 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.690
 how can a passionate man come out 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.670
 delay in cutting tomorrow's life 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.870
 perhaps among several we would have counted 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.250
 in 10-15 minutes however having 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.750
 trimmed today to mean a 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.270
 Earning time for tomorrow is a 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.550
 investment in time so tomorrow we spend 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.610
 with the direct teams we do and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.650
 by scales- effectively in the morning 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.780
 next the workers help me to 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.150
 upload my equipment and we cross without 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.330
 difficulty next to the remains of the tree 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.330
 fallen 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.420
 meanwhile in the temple located in 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.639
 the summit of the hill of the year 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.499
 heavy rains have hardly affected the 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.159
 work and consolidation work 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 continue at an excellent rate like this 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.049
 joint effort of archaeologists and 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:30.599
 inhabitants of tlayacapan return little 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.710
 little the old luster to the walls 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.080
 floors and stairways of the temple 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.750
 but one of the main benefits 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.420
 of this archaeological project is that the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 inhabitants of tlayacapan know more than 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.069
 its roots and take pride in the past 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.260
 from your community 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.049
 all this we had if we neither 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.620
 we even knew that there was this I 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.590
 banana had never come out here when it was 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.730
 younger I got on and never never took it 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.560
 meaning to this place we do not look very 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.750
 very leafy of trees and it was not given 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.439
 way now that we are here working 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.540
 with an answer that has the form of 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.540
 what in the pyramid 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.890
 but not all the archaeological work is 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.860
 Performs in the thicket of the mountain 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.330
 down in the collection center more 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.850
 people in the community make an effort 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 by rescuing the mud and the earth the 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.900
 heritage of his past 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.979
 and to work on this project that I 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.310
 invited to decide the closure of 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.310
 treatment 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.939
 I hope here with my companions to 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.200
 that the rosary falls in the work of 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:49.050
 Hill 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:53.240
 without washing the beacon and separating them and for 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.240
 it's a very nice experience because 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.280
 and I did not know ceramics and I did 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.330
 fact I commented that my 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.200
 mates and my dad but how do they follow 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.200
 now our relatives 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.640
 because I met my colleagues but 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.870
 now that we are participating then 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.980
 we live together we chat 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.260
 it is known that all the new link 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.600
 although it is heard as a task 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.780
 simple the work that these 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.730
 people is very important so under the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.770
 supervision of archaeologists follows a 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.660
 very elaborate process in which 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.310
 daily ceramic remains the 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.500
 pressure dug on top of the 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.170
 mountain are descended into bags of 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.060
 plastic each bag comes from an area 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.910
 specific to the excavation and it's 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.990
 separated cleaned and sorted 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.990
 agree on its origin and characteristics 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.080
 to give you an idea of the magnitude of 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.930
 this work at the moment you make these 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.729
 recordings has been found little more than 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.729
 a ton of materials
