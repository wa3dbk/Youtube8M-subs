00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
button that you cannot see because it

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.609 
button that you cannot see because it
isn't<00:00:18.660> mounted<00:00:19.170> yet<00:00:19.760> then<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
isn't mounted yet then we have the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.109 
isn't mounted yet then we have the

because<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.870> needed<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.380> frontier<00:00:35.370> suspension

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
because we needed a frontier suspension

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
because we needed a frontier suspension
that<00:00:36.360> means<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.950> suspension<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that means a suspension where the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
that means a suspension where the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
steering rack is in front of the axle

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.779 
steering rack is in front of the axle
and<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> steering<00:00:42.059> tie<00:00:42.480> rod<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.789> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and here is the steering tie rod and it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.650 
and here is the steering tie rod and it
comes<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.600> point<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.980> upright<00:00:47.280> and

comes to this point of the upright and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
comes to this point of the upright and
this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> X<00:00:49.110> aligner<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> front

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this is the X aligner so it is in front

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
this is the X aligner so it is in front
of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> axle<00:00:51.300> line<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.280> steering

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
driveshaft we have modified drift works

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.520 
driveshaft we have modified drift works
to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.070> upright<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:39.450> allows<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.170> lowering

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to be upright that allows the lowering

the<00:01:44.570> anti-roll<00:01:45.570> bars<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.290> stuck<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.979> now

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the anti-roll bars are stuck for now

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.679 
the anti-roll bars are stuck for now
because<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> car

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
because we don't know how the car

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.350 
because we don't know how the car
behaves<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.490> upgrade<00:01:50.640> them<00:01:50.970> later<00:01:51.149> if

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
behaves so we will upgrade them later if

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
behaves so we will upgrade them later if

the<00:02:01.049> custom<00:02:01.799> exhaust<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> looks

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the custom exhaust because it looks

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
the custom exhaust because it looks
rather<00:02:03.899> nice<00:02:04.549> nearly<00:02:05.549> three<00:02:05.880> feet<00:02:05.909> long

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
rather nice nearly three feet long

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.449 
and running into 2.5 inch side pipes
which<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.370> course<00:02:17.720> will<00:02:18.720> run<00:02:18.989> parallel<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
which of course will run parallel to the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.390 
which of course will run parallel to the
skills<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> preliminary<00:02:22.709> fitting

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
skills this is now a preliminary fitting

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.420 
skills this is now a preliminary fitting
so<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.599> shouldn't<00:02:24.870> care<00:02:25.079> about<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.500> weird

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so you shouldn't care about the weird

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.599 
so you shouldn't care about the weird
angle<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.180> has<00:02:27.329> with<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.599> chef<00:02:27.870> C<00:02:28.609> so

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
angle but it has with the chef C so

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.949 
angle but it has with the chef C so
basically<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.659> is<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> underneath<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.620> now

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
basically this is the underneath and now

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:50.470 
basically this is the underneath and now
let<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:33.989> car<00:02:34.560> come<00:02:34.890> down
