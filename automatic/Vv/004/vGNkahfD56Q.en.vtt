 well i'm flÃ¡vio ferreira teacher 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.930
 chemistry and dodo in technologies 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.860
 by the federal university of 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.960
 pernambuco 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.390
 we are developing a research where 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.789
 we managed to transform our tire to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:27.250
 spinal that is used in your car in the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:32.490
 your motorcycle in fuels in oil in gas 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.490
 in a carbon black and steel 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.980
 the objective of our research is to do 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.559
 meeting the reuse of tires where 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.050
 tires and insurance and make people 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.839
 can take advantage of all products that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.180
 He'll convince us to get the tire and 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.610
 terrestrial October in process 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.530
 tire collection will form a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.809
 gas mixture all these expenses 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.990
 including methane gas 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.240
 these expenses will be put up in a 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.369
 place within the machinery 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.360
 to win and enjoy transformed into 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.789
 energy 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.590
 another product that will be taken is that 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.869
 Naomi is inside the tire. 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.360
 that name it will melt and agent 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.060
 walter reused take ground was left 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.520
 metal tire industry is this 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 We can even take the river case. 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.170
 this oil that we have walks nothing more 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.090
 plus a kitchen we can 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.789
 put it in your car and do it all 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.100
 portugal with high quality 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.700
 fourth product is what we call 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.710
 background black that breath for what it serves 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 This book was the background of the so-called 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.320
 was used with pigments for farms 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.200
 but is used in addition to the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.969
 automobile chip with this whole

 all that body of your car that is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 painted with the color of the vehicle is that

 plastic is black background is important to 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.340
 People, we can do it. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 with which those garbage collectors are 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.270
 environmental agents 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.190
 then this research is not only 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.740
 research at the financial level is a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.340
 research that also involves my social 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 of the citizen
