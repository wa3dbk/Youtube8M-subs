00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.450
 and then good good people this is a motor of the 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.799
 romance left seventh generation model there 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.599
 2001 until 2006, I'll show you that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 some engine failures 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.660
 for those who do not know who they want 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 be aware of the update of some 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 more people can start here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:36.380
 logo is clearly visible reservoir 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.380
 maximum and will not take care of me 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:48.059
 the windscreen wiper reservoir 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 that the hydraulic reservoir of 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.250
 hydraulic steering is low is important 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.649
 see if it will not be luscious here 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 because if you have guilt in the system the eye 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.670
 It's going to leak a little, so who's there? 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.360
 You're giving your audience time to time. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 when a certain good that the dipstick 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.650
 and you can view it here. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.210
 You'll have a lot of people question logo 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.210
 I was going from there from the fuse box 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the fuse box 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.720
 Put your hand here you will have a rod 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.550
 in the case that the cover it is yellow 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.700
 this dipstick is the oil level of the carton 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.180
 in case this model here is the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 automatic model then the location 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 this rod is close by and worth remembering. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.870
 that in manual latem has explaining how 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 is that this reading is made because the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.580
 car is hot you have to turn it off 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.880
 and after about a minute he has 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.380
 to do this the removal of the ditch for 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.140
 receive information and oil level 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.330
 and try a flat totally flat place 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.600
 right 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.160
 in one year I think the wheel design that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.000
 my wrong 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.180
 the water reservoir to measure 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.180
 mass is very down there in case I can 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.190
 To say that you can not see it like that. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 They are looking at how to make the most 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.340
 If you are going to have to ask me to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.120
 and if it will put the lantern coast 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 flashlight on the wall of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.220
 rock in a car that you will win 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.950
 some ireland and you will have no idea 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.680
 the maximum or minimum is not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:57.200
 and I give you tips you come here at 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:00.689
 windscreen reservoir inserts 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.319
 because in the water tank of the 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.719
 cooling and the measurement made it 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.469
 siesta between the maximum and minimum that 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:13.769
 retires will have the markup here be 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.389
 now it's over next time you do not even need 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.480
 play in the lantern 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.090
 just put the rod and have idea where 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.659
 it was right 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:29.790
 no more the fitub the removal of the screws 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.739
 here is a pump resonance box 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.370
 steering power steering 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.099
 hydraulic 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.900
 Governor and soon 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.069
 below the trainer the air compressor 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.930
 condition that the lambda probe is 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.040
 located at the value of tactical love 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.760
 under the balcony to show the tip 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.790
 valley is worth remembering that not only the note and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.709
 box then if you go 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.810
 do some service in this region that 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.370
 it is important to see if your mechanic will not 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.889
 will accidentally damaged are 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.609
 because it is very fragile how 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:12.540
 everything works is that if you were a fan 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:17.359
 two sides and does not have many details to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.359
 more sure also round
