00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey people and get to my new one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 video here in the video I would like to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 Two spectators ask questions that I answer 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.809
 gotten in the last few days 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.830
 like some of you again 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.889
 have heard 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 I worked with him again 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.580
 that means I have some videos again 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.090
 where i created my background, so to speak 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 replace that is always a thing the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.010
 sometimes can be quite expensive 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.830
 and then came the same 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.040
 Freedom and may like what used 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.720
 ever a background system because 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 many of you or many youtubers 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 make the following use them easy 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.130
 The green fabric as a background system 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.870
 exciting behind me and I have 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.850
 Ten times something extreme prepared 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 Just blooming fabric you wrong 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.950
 stored then you see immediately if 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.150
 you unpack it is totally 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 wrinkled and if I have that now 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.550
 hang up behind me 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.649
 Do you see that in all the folds here 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 shadows are created and quasi others 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.420
 light colors that means we just have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.040
 only dark green shadow on this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.900
 then you do not have the best 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.130
 cinema program you get that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 not in the handle and has 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.590
 Accordingly, an incredible effort 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.450
 Turn that back around me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.010
 I spare the effort to spare 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 actually only two more 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 main systems so I still use 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 this material since I had even then 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 I made a video about how I work 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.040
 I link with that just at the end 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.930
 this videos as you can so again no 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.090
 but that's too expensive for me 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.680
 to build up all the stuff right now 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 hang out and the like 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 and there are two possibilities here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 I prefer these videos so fast 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960
 as possible to turn 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 possibility one is this one here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.229
 I buy this beautiful part here 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 just pack this out 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.119
 fabric parts photo fabric parts on a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.010
 metal frames are curious which are there 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 in many different colors as can 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.390
 you just unpack it so we see 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 here green blue and if you have this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.720
 opens up caution schnapps one has one 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.060
 complete background system what 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.530
 pretty curious I mean we see 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.100
 here also about small dents and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.860
 but that folds right in 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.850
 borders and this system can then be 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.100
 I'll just say that with one 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.100
 exciting then simply force here 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.090
 clamp a cabinet or something and 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.500
 then has a complete 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.870
 background system can imagine 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.240
 I can start right away I recommend 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.650
 always fits a nice daytime 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.450
 off as for example now here at the moment 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.190
 I almost need you here in this room 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.630
 Hardly anything to illuminate 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.920
 a bit to light my head and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.740
 my video is almost perfect 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.170
 created this system user this 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.870
 There are also a number smaller systems 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.940
 that is for the people then 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.400
 accordingly only her face or 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.680
 we want to film her upper body 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.330
 this system is just then 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.850
 accordingly only 80 or 60 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.380
 centimeter that is now white gold 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.060
 however, we have one here 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.200
 Zipper we can easily 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 open and underneath are many 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.050
 nice other colors sometimes too 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.940
 green and blue and we can go back then 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.950
 almost free our background 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.170
 make this system easy 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.160
 stand behind us and stand in front of us 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.410
 you can get started right away 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.210
 But the system that is not me now 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.540
 system what actually intended 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.480
 is 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.110
 this is from a manufacturer for 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.240
 Outdoor facilities and the builds these systems 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.000
 this is a kind marquise you 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.430
 builds in the garden and that is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.220
 on new system with three meter fabric times 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.990
 1 meter 80 included in it and the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.140
 Manufacturer also has this color in the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.970
 program green 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.970
 the system is now on me 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.120
 dearest costs 90 euro at 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.280
 cheapest manufacturer and the system 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.590
 I just got it all 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.270
 Cabinets mounted in my house or 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.360
 partly gone to the ceiling I have 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.520
 since several systems of the bought that 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.950
 Unfortunately, the system has to be mounted at an angle 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.140
 Otherwise there will be a roll on us 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.820
 the fabric is very strong on the edges here 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.530
 Top pure but when he reached the in 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.570
 I've just got one here 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.120
 wooden slat screwed on the back and 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.799
 then just have the system up here 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.180
 screwed on my closet 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.560
 your next advantage 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.600
 I'll just show you when I am 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.220
 I do not turn the system easy 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.140
 above and if I'm here fast 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.960
 many want the system easy 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.360
 down as I said it also has one 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.620
 lock there is a stand, so to speak 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.630
 You can do that on the floor 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.500
 fix or not i do that 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.120
 meanwhile different 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.750
 I always have one here 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.820
 Sparswangen and fasten that somewhere on the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.030
 cabinet that means I drive the system 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.260
 just down here and just consolidate 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.210
 with such a thrilling here 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.560
 grab some cupboard or you can 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.000
 you there if you wanted one too 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.640
 build something 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.410
 there are many many possibilities and 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.270
 so I'm with a handle virtually 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.800
 I still have to be ready for action 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.410
 a little bit for the lighting 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.660
 and we can start right away we have here 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.729
 at once free background with few 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.620
 color changes in stocks in it 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.260
 but most programs do that 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.630
 without problems and can almost immediately 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.810
 start what is old here at the system on 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.180
 best is we have absolutely no fold 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.550
 the system is better than this 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.140
 Systems are also relatively old 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.430
 Of course, look through this 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.690
 click together we have a few 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.550
 but they also work 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.800
 pretty good but i work 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.490
 meanwhile most like this 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.200
 system 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.240
 I have some systems too 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.380
 mounted horizontally and vertically like this 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.600
 that I'm the one out of the wall 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.850
 can pull out or up from the blanket 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.410
 So you can even this system several times 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.240
 combine with each other and if I do 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.479
 see what costs so profi systems here 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.650
 this role is also available in the profi 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.240
 variants this is a real rollos 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.460
 you hang on the ceiling for something like that 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.289
 you can easily experience 2 3 or 4 100 euro 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.770
 down 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:04.439
 and the system as I said around 90 euros 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.899
 so i hope i was able to help you with these 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.249
 help and ask questions 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.379
 to answer everything 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.119
 I just do the following times I hammer 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.779
 I showed the links to the whole 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:16.889
 Systems below in the video description 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:19.499
 important is just as I said you have to 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.909
 Look at it without wrinkles 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.580
 works or accordingly one 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.559
 i use better kings software 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.449
 come here first to the end of my 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.099
 I hope I could ask the question 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.389
 has sufficiently answer you 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.879
 video helps me please 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.439
 a thumbs up and wanted more 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.449
 Similar videos look for all things 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.949
 also the other video to the team 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.839
 I have that down here in the 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.399
 notes with linked and herewith 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:44.509
 I'll say goodbye until next time 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:44.509
 new market on youtube
