00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.879
 yes welcome to the season 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 on phishing 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.110
 today we are from holling in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.849
 Upper Bavaria and we will try here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.849
 to collect a couple of before to collect 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 Wait until then actually 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.470
 managed to catch a fish 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 has a small lid bachsaibling 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.949
 Relatively pulled because the fish 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.110
 Be so active and hold us now 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.699
 noticed that not only on 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.930
 slow for the bait or puzzle 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.730
 is caught but actually 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 pretty fast an active guided 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.699
 kÃ¶hler gives catch it wonders me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 a bit because actually 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 usually the club at such 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.760
 Water temperatures are pretty sluggish though 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.990
 it will be the same with you later on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 significantly faster execution fallen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.020
 and that's why we come to this one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.190
 Try the sun a little bit 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.210
 also come out nice again and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.870
 might be easy now 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.870
 bit more active 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 we have it on one of two maps 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.909
 caught silver with black points 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.670
 Yes 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.510
 not bad maybe i'll look if 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.510
 she can see 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.340
 There we have 40 again 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.630
 centimeter on the pose with white shows 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.930
 but how the device would say later 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.930
 even more 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.880
 21 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.640
 6 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.239
 here you doubt that there is anything 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.239
 becomes 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.810
 she really wanted that and she wanted it 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.810
 has also gotten 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.570
 here occurs 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.420
 we have a little bit now 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.070
 a protected area withdrawn 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.690
 So I'm going to graduate now 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.260
 again the same with today 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.260
 have acted 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.660
 we just have a whole lot to play 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.160
 normal game with 40 grams weight that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.250
 probably even up to 4 can also 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.410
 take less 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.260
 3001 agus as a role and I only believe 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.580
 15 of the capital I braided what 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.110
 still as a small pinch did 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.210
 is that I'm so braided before 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.400
 hour from 34 meters just before many 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.110
 just have as one 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.270
 little bit as a shock absorber because she does not 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.800
 is so clearly visible and yes so it is 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.490
 in principle a long procedure that you 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.990
 practically with catch-up and thereby less 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.880
 vehicles 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.960
 just like I had from winter on 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.080
 we still with the second method 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.870
 is fishing, that is fishing 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.580
 quite normal pose montage like her here 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.580
 just look here in the little wobbly 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.920
 two gram load and a few 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.450
 weights to swirl then you come 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.730
 iphone forell approach with a 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.140
 about six hooks could also be one 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.240
 four hooks or two hooks take that 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.930
 is then relatively the same also 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.820
 stopped here 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.760
 The route is about three meters now 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.740
 sixty long and has a weight of around 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.630
 the 20 grams it is actually berliner 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.360
 route which has a great action and 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.700
 as a rolling 2500 shimano blade runner 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.790
 if I think only 20 euro fell 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:18.000
 So they are also reasonably big 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.040
 trout or problems in check yes here 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.300
 I have a few more now 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.520
 players we used today 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.590
 to pose at very short we have 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.570
 just white in front of a batter I took 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.040
 would just recommend you pick 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.880
 a black ford brings through the 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.400
 white 1 day 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.570
 and maybe even a green one 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.770
 then you should actually have everything 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.040
 what you need and then just by 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.090
 try and yes now to the spenders 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.020
 I want to be a bit too 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.700
 pick pick 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.190
 So whatever you can do is actually 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.830
 We have spinner there for one thing 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.490
 silver then black that will open 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.720
 every case we have to have two colors 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.419
 and then you can also look around 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.630
 experiment like this one for example 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.970
 rainbow colors or with this 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.530
 brook trout colors and then there is 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.849
 Of course, even the exotics such 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.370
 Spinner bates, of course, are always 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.220
 good because it says so octopus shreds so yes 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.630
 I have times and also spinach leaves and 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.669
 then of course the normal place 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.500
 never wrong if the fish too 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.599
 a bit slower presentation 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.960
 stand up or maybe just up 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.250
 small fish exactly so much there 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.949
 You do not have to be overly 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.180
 take bait amount just a few 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.650
 different colors and then should 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.479
 actually work, especially in 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.800
 club where the free ones in the 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.240
 normal case based on everything here 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.919
 not at three on the tree is what us 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.330
 It is quite noticeable today 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.530
 It is important for them to change easily 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.840
 between the lures 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.159
 So we rarely do more than 10 20 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.810
 then throw with a bait switch 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.220
 but do not forget it again 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.659
 For example , you have to come back 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.580
 silver today started with silver 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.050
 Spinners have nothing caught and are 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.800
 later returned to silver 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.080
 have caught 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.250
 So just try replacing it 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.590
 but also uses of 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.509
 I only used you again 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.099
 again as a tip and yes then 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.960
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.460
 if you have any suggestions fans 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.960
 have what we can improve on 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.430
 our videos then just write us 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.750
 just try completely in the comments 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.750
 to be implemented next time
