00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 these guys and girls rest whatever 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 I'm Carsten Schatz why 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.989
 one or the other identified 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.989
 I consider this maybe is somehow 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.739
 I always like to spend my money through the floor of 118 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 unimportant 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 Deutschmann may also have heard rumors that Jack Sparrow 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.910
 a crew adjusts 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.000
 Not everyone has run out to the source of youth from the port 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.770
 but it is not the truth either 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 would not you want to be there, or maybe you would 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.750
 tanned 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 on our way 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 in eternal youth 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 during an expedition 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.040
 as it appears 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.330
 Jack Sparrow 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 Clinics were not rewarded RS 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.840
 Read here how it works 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 it was good to feel 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.270
 the search for the source of eternal youth 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 There is no purchase or the source available 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 as urban resources 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.670
 it's about the source 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 Hertha and way out of the way 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.859
 the 1 "If I wanted to try something now just interpret that way 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.390
 Judge is 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 Ulrich Rademacher in the report 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 what was going on there? 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.600
 the journey is driven many 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 first 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
 let eight 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.890
 the deadly accidents 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 but not 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 all that 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.219
 Mr. Clarity 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.529
 that he is no longer there 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.810
 "Why do you have to put back tougher supervision now? 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.810
 usually not 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.139
 Meyer 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:41.999
 Franziska 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.999
 Accommodates somewhere 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 I hate it 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.619
 Hannah also all of us agree that first again
