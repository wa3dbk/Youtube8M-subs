00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.740
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.580
 fabrics cone and forex ball cutter 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.640
 metal lime scissors stick bills 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.680
 sequins pins and cleans pipes 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 to begin we are going to divide the cone into 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.890
 four quadrants later we will divide it 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.680
 vertically on six floors for it 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 let's mark in the base what they would be 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.700
 the four corners 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.910
 then we will mark from each 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.140
 corner a line towards the tip of the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.570
 cone 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.360
 in this way we would leave divided 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.329
 our core on four sides now let's go 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.540
 to mark some curves from a line 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.940
 vertical to the other and in this way 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.379
 our cone will be divided into six 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.379
 heights and four sides 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 You see how we have already been divided into 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 six quadrants per side 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 the next step is to cut with the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 cutter each of the lines that we have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.820
 marked with the pencil both 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.820
 verticals like the horizontal ones 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 we already have all the cuts made 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 now we are going to line the quadrants with 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.330
 a piece of fabric that we will cut a 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.200
 little bigger than the quadrant that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.200
 let's go lining 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.020
 to cover it we put the little bit of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.870
 fabric on the quadrant we want 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.420
 line and with the help of the lime 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.400
 we are going to send lightly the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.030
 fabric in the crevices we've made 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.030
 with the cutter 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.380
 we do not have to press gently 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.520
 much simply so that we stay 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.520
 located the fabric 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.800
 now with the scissors we are going to cut 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 the excess fabric 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.450
 with the lime let's finish re-metering 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.830
 the edges of the fabric so that it does not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 see and remain hidden in the crevices 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.000
 let's do this same procedure 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.610
 with each and every one of the quadrants 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 that we have marked in the cone we 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.130
 we will change color in each 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.130
 of the heights 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.620
 You see how we have all the cone 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.700
 lined with different colors 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.880
 now to line the top 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.580
 we have cut a circle to which then 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.280
 we have cut these corners and he has 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.590
 this kind of cross is left we're going to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.470
 place on the top of the cone 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.300
 well centered by matching the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.450
 arms of the cross with the four 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.370
 quadrants that we have marked in the cone 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.799
 thus 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.799
 with the lime we put the cloth 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.730
 just like before we cut the excess 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 we finished putting a little 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.030
 and now what we will do will be a small 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.959
 fold 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:26.540
 hide the end of the cloth and re 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.540
 we will put in the same way 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.830
 and in this way we are going to cover the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.220
 four sides of the highest part of the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.220
 cone 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.200
 we do the same thing on the other side you 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.200
 we put 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.009
 we cut the excess 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.510
 and we make a small fold for 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.670
 hide 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.980
 the cloth is as if we made a clamp 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.070
 in the clothes that hide the fabric that we 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:20.680
 It remains in the crease and then we put 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.790
 the end with the lime in the indentation 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.400
 basically the password technique without 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.410
 needle consists of this you saw it 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.830
 also in the craft we made of the 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.830
 balloon 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.830
 we go now to the bottom to 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.000
 we have marked and cut it with the 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.010
 Cut a circle about 5 millimeters from the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.080
 edge of the base of the cone that will be where 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.720
 we finished the end that we have left 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.470
 hanging when lining the quadrants 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.060
 inferior you see how we have all been 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.060
 completely lined you see how we have 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.830
 forwarded the edges below the cone to 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.530
 that are hidden and then we have 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.030
 decorated with this clean pipes 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.710
 wrapping it around the cone and 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.380
 pricking his own wire in the cone 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.990
 Now let's decorate with beads or 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.630
 any kind of accounts inserting the 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.430
 on a pin to which we also put 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.760
 a sequin to make us the 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.760
 stop 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.180
 here you see how we have been left with a 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.100
 lots of different accounts and up 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.370
 we have put one in the form of a small 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.370
 star 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.400
 to put it on its feet we have cut the 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.740
 ball it is half and we 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.889
 lined with the same technique simply 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.370
 now we insert a toothpick in the center 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:55.100
 of the cone and in the center of the base and already 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.860
 we would stand and so simple 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.620
 it's how we made our fir 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.210
 Christmas with password without needle os 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.889
 I remember that in crafts point is 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.090
 you can download all the instructions 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.090
