00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
thing I tapped it the first time so just

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670 
thing I tapped it the first time so just
a<00:00:58.770> couple<00:00:58.890> points<00:00:59.809> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> better<00:01:01.200> than<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.530> up

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
a couple points this is better than I up

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
a couple points this is better than I up
cracker<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.850> cracker<00:01:03.059> doesn't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
cracker and the I up cracker doesn't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
cracker and the I up cracker doesn't
work<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.840> apps<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.530> verify<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
work for apps that verify with the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
work for apps that verify with the
server<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:07.940> covers<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.090> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.690> apps<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
server so that covers a lot of apps and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.570 
server so that covers a lot of apps and
this<00:01:10.920> appears<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:12.150> around<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
this appears to get around that so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.609 
this appears to get around that so
that's<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.820> positive<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> there's<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
that's one positive the so there's the

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
that's one positive the so there's the
sorry<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> profiles<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.939> are

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
when you get to that point so what this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
basically is doing is when you make an

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.440 
basically is doing is when you make an
in-app<00:01:47.520> purchase<00:01:47.970> somehow<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
in-app purchase somehow it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.240 
in-app purchase somehow it's
intercepting<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> his

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
intercepting it and it's going to his

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.200 
intercepting it and it's going to his
server<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:52.460> making<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> handoff<00:01:53.700> saying

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
server and making the handoff saying

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.230 
server and making the handoff saying
that<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> purchase<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.869> good

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.060 

so<00:01:59.240> now<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.870> you<00:02:00.050> have<00:02:00.110> those<00:02:00.320> installed<00:02:00.710> all

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so now that you have those installed all
