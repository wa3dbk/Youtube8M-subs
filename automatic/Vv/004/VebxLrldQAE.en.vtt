happens in a typical town house

happens in a typical town house
apartment<00:00:58.310> or<00:00:58.610> small<00:00:59.300> single-family<00:00:59.750> houses

apartment or small single-family houses

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.290 
apartment or small single-family houses
it<00:01:00.350> gets<00:01:00.470> reduced<00:01:00.830> down<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.100> basically<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
it gets reduced down to basically a

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.929 
it gets reduced down to basically a
little<00:01:02.840> thing<00:01:03.080> in<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.470> corner<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.950> so<00:01:04.460> when

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
little thing in the corner and so when

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.370 
little thing in the corner and so when
we<00:01:05.089> look<00:01:05.299> at<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.600> see<00:01:05.899> what<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.140> actually

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
we look at and see what that actually

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.319 
we look at and see what that actually
looks<00:01:06.649> like<00:01:06.859> in<00:01:07.189> plan<00:01:07.490> although<00:01:07.759> it<00:01:07.969> has<00:01:08.149> a

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
looks like in plan although it has a

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.050 
looks like in plan although it has a
fancy<00:01:08.960> name<00:01:09.170> pantry<00:01:10.009> it<00:01:10.189> really<00:01:10.609> isn't<00:01:10.759> all

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
fancy name pantry it really isn't all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.120 
fancy name pantry it really isn't all
that<00:01:11.119> useful<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.840> mean<00:01:12.020> we've<00:01:12.229> got<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.649> very

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
that useful I mean we've got a very

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.370 
that useful I mean we've got a very
little<00:01:13.460> bit<00:01:13.609> of<00:01:13.759> counter<00:01:14.000> space<00:01:14.240> we've<00:01:14.929> got<00:01:15.170> a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
little bit of counter space we've got a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.899 
little bit of counter space we've got a
45<00:01:15.890> degree<00:01:16.070> angle<00:01:16.399> which<00:01:16.490> you're<00:01:16.670> going<00:01:16.850> to

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
45 degree angle which you're going to

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.190 
45 degree angle which you're going to
talk<00:01:17.030> about<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:17.359> minute<00:01:17.450> what<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.719> does<00:01:18.049> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
talk about in a minute what that does to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.249 
talk about in a minute what that does to
the<00:01:18.320> rest<00:01:18.499> of<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.740> kitchen<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.420> does

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the rest of the kitchen but it it does

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.450 
the rest of the kitchen but it it does
it's<00:01:21.499> something<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.859> you<00:01:21.979> can't<00:01:22.219> really

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it's something that you can't really

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.849 
it's something that you can't really
even<00:01:22.549> walk<00:01:22.909> into<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.509> can<00:01:23.630> walk<00:01:23.840> up<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:24.560> and

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
even walk into you can walk up to and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.099 
even walk into you can walk up to and
it's<00:01:25.340> not<00:01:25.579> as<00:01:25.850> effective<00:01:26.509> at<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.749> end<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:27.020> the

of<00:01:29.899> pantries<00:01:30.409> yeah<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.770> my<00:01:30.890> biggest<00:01:31.130> issue

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
of pantries yeah and my biggest issue

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.160 
of pantries yeah and my biggest issue
with<00:01:31.670> them<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:31.999> when<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.359> designers<00:01:32.810> start<00:01:33.049> to

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
with them is when the designers start to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.739 
with them is when the designers start to
integrate<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.679> 45<00:01:34.130> degree<00:01:34.490> angle<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
integrate the 45 degree angle of the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.209 
integrate the 45 degree angle of the
pantry<00:01:36.140> into<00:01:36.380> other<00:01:36.590> elements<00:01:37.069> in<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
pantry into other elements in the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.559 
pantry into other elements in the
kitchen<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.609> this<00:01:37.700> case<00:01:37.909> they've<00:01:38.090> had<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.359> sham

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
kitchen in this case they've had to sham

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.630 
kitchen in this case they've had to sham
for<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.899> edge<00:01:39.049> of<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.319> island<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.280> resolve

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
for the edge of the island to resolve

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.609 
for the edge of the island to resolve
the<00:01:40.819> geometry<00:01:41.359> of<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.569> corner<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.469> makes

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
the geometry of that corner and it makes

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.950 
the geometry of that corner and it makes
the<00:01:42.740> island<00:01:43.159> awkward<00:01:43.549> also<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:44.329> door<00:01:44.600> swing

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the island awkward also the door swing

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.599 
the island awkward also the door swing
here<00:01:45.200> often<00:01:45.409> they<00:01:45.740> swing<00:01:46.039> out<00:01:46.219> and<00:01:46.249> they

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
here often they swing out and they

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.429 
here often they swing out and they
typically<00:01:46.969> use<00:01:47.090> House<00:01:47.479> passage<00:01:48.020> doors<00:01:48.289> which

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
typically use House passage doors which

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.870 
typically use House passage doors which
are<00:01:48.590> not<00:01:48.770> millwork<00:01:49.189> doors<00:01:49.399> they're<00:01:49.670> large

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
are not millwork doors they're large

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.399 
are not millwork doors they're large
they<00:01:50.119> take<00:01:50.359> up<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.569> lot<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> space<00:01:51.079> with<00:01:51.319> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
they take up a lot of space with the

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.260 
they take up a lot of space with the
swing<00:01:51.649> look<00:01:52.159> at<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.369> location<00:01:52.819> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.999> fridge

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
swing look at the location of the fridge

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.510 
swing look at the location of the fridge
this<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.509> very<00:01:53.840> common<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.710> designers<00:01:55.189> place

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
this is very common the designers place

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.919 
this is very common the designers place
the<00:01:55.729> fridge<00:01:55.939> right<00:01:56.179> up<00:01:56.329> against<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.749> corner

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
the fridge right up against the corner

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.809 
the fridge right up against the corner
pantry<00:01:57.380> think<00:01:57.770> about<00:01:57.979> how<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.189> door<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.520> going

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
pantry think about how the door is going

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.099 
pantry think about how the door is going
to<00:01:58.880> swing<00:01:59.090> there<00:01:59.240> going<00:01:59.359> to<00:01:59.389> be<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.569> collision

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
to swing there going to be a collision

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.749 
to swing there going to be a collision
right<00:02:00.409> there<00:02:00.679> and<00:02:00.859> then<00:02:01.249> at<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.459> end<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
right there and then at the end of the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.249 
right there and then at the end of the
day<00:02:01.850> there's<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.119> little<00:02:02.509> bit<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.749> space<00:02:02.929> where

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
day there's a little bit of space where

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.379 
day there's a little bit of space where
you<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.770> stand<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:04.909> there's<00:02:05.060> awkward

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
you can stand and then there's awkward

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.120 
you can stand and then there's awkward
storage<00:02:05.959> in<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.170> corner<00:02:06.469> which<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.619> really

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
storage in the corner which is really

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.800 
storage in the corner which is really
not<00:02:07.249> very<00:02:07.520> functional<00:02:07.759> right<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
not very functional right I think the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
not very functional right I think the
the<00:02:09.080> far<00:02:09.500> better<00:02:09.740> solution<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.430> this

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
the far better solution in this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.250 
the far better solution in this
particular<00:02:11.120> case<00:02:11.330> would<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.750> have<00:02:12.020> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
particular case would be to have just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.890 
particular case would be to have just
extend<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.950> counter<00:02:13.670> all<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.030> way<00:02:14.120> along

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
extend the counter all the way along

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.369 
extend the counter all the way along
then<00:02:15.079> had<00:02:15.439> a<00:02:15.739> piece<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.519> built<00:02:16.939> in<00:02:17.379> Florida

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
then had a piece of built in Florida

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.800 
then had a piece of built in Florida
ceiling<00:02:18.799> pantry<00:02:19.280> storage<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.970> way<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.659> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
ceiling pantry storage that way so that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.690 
ceiling pantry storage that way so that
you<00:02:20.930> would<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.439> had<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.650> much<00:02:22.040> storage<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
you would have had that much storage and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.280 
you would have had that much storage and
then<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:23.030> lot<00:02:23.209> more<00:02:23.239> counter<00:02:23.870> space

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
then a lot more counter space

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020 
then a lot more counter space
so<00:02:24.439> remember<00:02:24.829> corner<00:02:25.129> pantries<00:02:25.519> only<00:02:25.730> provide

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so remember corner pantries only provide

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.429 
so remember corner pantries only provide
the<00:02:26.209> illusion<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.750> storage<00:02:27.049> we<00:02:27.200> don't

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
the illusion of storage we don't

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.229 
the illusion of storage we don't
recommend<00:02:27.799> them<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.159> kitchen<00:02:28.489> design<00:02:28.519> see<00:02:29.150> you
