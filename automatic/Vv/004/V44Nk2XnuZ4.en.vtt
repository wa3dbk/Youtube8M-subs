00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
down so if somebody's down there you
know<00:03:28.709> you're<00:03:28.980> ready<00:03:29.190> instead<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.060> because<00:03:30.420> you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
know you're ready instead of because you

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.170 
know you're ready instead of because you
know<00:03:30.570> technically<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:32.400> you're<00:03:32.640> up<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.060> if

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
know technically if you're up here if

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.240 
know technically if you're up here if
you're<00:03:33.299> aiming<00:03:33.600> up<00:03:33.690> here<00:03:34.019> let's<00:03:34.799> say<00:03:34.950> in

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
you're aiming up here let's say in

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.949 
you're aiming up here let's say in
perfectly<00:03:35.700> straight<00:03:35.790> down<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.299> somebody's

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
perfectly straight down and somebody's

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.720 
perfectly straight down and somebody's
down<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.560> takes<00:03:37.739> longer<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.549> aim<00:03:38.700> down

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
down there it takes longer to aim down

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.940 
down there it takes longer to aim down
to<00:03:39.150> shoot<00:03:39.360> them<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.630> call<00:03:40.230> duty<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.709> such<00:03:40.920> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
to shoot them and call duty it's such a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.810 
to shoot them and call duty it's such a
fast-paced<00:03:41.579> game<00:03:42.170> than<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.980> time<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.579> takes

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
fast-paced game than that time it takes

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.729 
fast-paced game than that time it takes
you<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> aim<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.420> could<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.260> difference

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
you to aim down could be the difference

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.220 
you to aim down could be the difference
between<00:03:46.829> life<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.610> death<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.630> could<00:03:48.959> be<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
between life and death it could be the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
between life and death it could be the
difference<00:03:49.380> between<00:03:50.190> living<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.850> dying

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
difference between living and dying

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.270 
difference between living and dying
because<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.840> could<00:03:52.079> be<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:53.070> bullet

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
because that could be a one bullet

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.740 
because that could be a one bullet
difference<00:03:53.670> because<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.239> gunfights

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
difference because you get in gunfights

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.740 
difference because you get in gunfights
all<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.140> time<00:03:55.350> where<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.670> know<00:03:56.820> one

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
all the time where it's you know one

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.210 
all the time where it's you know one
bullet<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.829> know<00:03:58.860> make<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
bullet that can you know make a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.460 
bullet that can you know make a
difference<00:03:59.640> in<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> game<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.170> know<00:04:01.290> this

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
difference in the game so you know this

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.810 
difference in the game so you know this
is<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> Gasol<00:04:02.010> right<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:02.280> people<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.670> always

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
think about it but you want to you know

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.790 
think about it but you want to you know
trying<00:05:38.550> to<00:05:38.610> think<00:05:38.699> and<00:05:39.690> practice<00:05:40.409> kind<00:05:40.740> of

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
trying to think and practice kind of

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.580 
trying to think and practice kind of
aiming<00:05:41.039> towards<00:05:41.669> their<00:05:41.849> midsection<00:05:42.659> not<00:05:43.380> that

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
aiming towards their midsection not that

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.159 
aiming towards their midsection not that
there<00:05:43.740> are<00:05:43.860> legs<00:05:44.190> or<00:05:44.520> anything<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:45.599> but

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
there are legs or anything like that but

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.300 
there are legs or anything like that but
kind<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.409> aim<00:05:46.530> towards<00:05:46.889> our<00:05:46.979> midsection

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
kind of aim towards our midsection

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.830 
kind of aim towards our midsection
because<00:05:47.669> if<00:05:47.849> you're<00:05:48.030> both<00:05:48.270> running<00:05:48.479> at<00:05:48.750> each

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
because if you're both running at each

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.360 
because if you're both running at each
other<00:05:49.020> you're<00:05:49.199> more<00:05:49.470> than<00:05:49.560> likely<00:05:49.620> both<00:05:50.099> gonna

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
other you're more than likely both gonna

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.600 
other you're more than likely both gonna
pull<00:05:50.639> up<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:51.000> start<00:05:51.539> shooting<00:05:51.750> each<00:05:51.990> other<00:05:52.610> so

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
pull up and start shooting each other so

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.550 
pull up and start shooting each other so
it's<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:53.849> really<00:05:54.120> good<00:05:54.240> idea<00:05:54.300> to<00:05:55.110> kind<00:05:55.289> of<00:05:55.380> aim

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
it's a really good idea to kind of aim

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.320 
it's a really good idea to kind of aim
in<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.800> midsection<00:05:56.130> especially<00:05:57.090> if<00:05:57.180> you're

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
in the midsection especially if you're

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.420 
in the midsection especially if you're
sniping<00:05:58.070> let's<00:05:59.070> see<00:05:59.220> if<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.729> get<00:05:59.789> a<00:05:59.909> sniper

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
sniping let's see if I get a sniper

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.580 
sniping let's see if I get a sniper
right<00:06:02.430> here<00:06:02.610> so<00:06:03.030> like<00:06:03.180> say<00:06:03.570> I<00:06:03.630> get<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.810> sniper<00:06:04.110> a

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
right here so like say I get a sniper a

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.379 
right here so like say I get a sniper a
lot<00:06:05.340> of<00:06:05.550> times<00:06:05.729> at<00:06:05.880> this<00:06:05.940> time<00:06:06.120> because<00:06:06.300> you're

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
lot of times at this time because you're

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.990 
lot of times at this time because you're
aiming<00:06:06.720> down<00:06:06.840> you<00:06:07.020> get<00:06:07.139> shot<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.650> pops<00:06:08.039> up<00:06:08.370> so

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
aiming down you get shot it pops up so

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.070 
aiming down you get shot it pops up so
