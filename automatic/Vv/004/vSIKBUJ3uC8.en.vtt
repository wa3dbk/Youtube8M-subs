00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
nice that they have this plastic I don't

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.390 
nice that they have this plastic I don't
know<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.500> see<00:02:53.800> here<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> video

know if you can see here in the video
they<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.030> plastic<00:02:55.480> around<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
they have this plastic around the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.100 
they have this plastic around the
opening<00:02:56.200> some<00:02:56.860> power<00:02:57.280> supply<00:02:57.580> manufacturers

don't<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.620> which<00:03:00.340> basically<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.660> lead

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
don't have this which basically can lead

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.410 
don't have this which basically can lead
to<00:03:02.080> if<00:03:02.290> these<00:03:02.530> cables<00:03:03.280> get<00:03:03.430> pulled<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.209> pushed

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
to if these cables get pulled and pushed

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.180 
to if these cables get pulled and pushed
around<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:05.020> will<00:03:05.110> actually<00:03:05.290> rip<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.770> cable<00:03:06.100> so

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
around it will actually rip the cable so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.050 
around it will actually rip the cable so
it's<00:03:06.310> nice<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.820> like<00:03:06.970> little

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
plastic around there let's get to the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.420 
plastic around there let's get to the
actual<00:03:09.520> cables<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.739> come<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.160> nice

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
actual cables that do come in this nice

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.710 
actual cables that do come in this nice
package<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.920> they<00:03:17.920> use<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.730> flat<00:03:19.120> cable

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
