 talks about that is about sites 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.319
 let's build them on dzhuma estesno 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.720
 but in the first part we will see how 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.939
 check without having at hand all mobile 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.279
 devices which 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.039
 Japanese with Koreans 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.359
 filled the light 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.439
 but the Chinese have not gone far what 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 in year 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.869
 how to check how our site is imitating 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.880
 yassi or is there some kind of samsung 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.770
 but still a video if we 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.890
 problem site courts are fermenting the site on 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 Maldives will arise 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.240
 the evening of visible paleok 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.230
 and tactics there are two ways the very first and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.110
 the easiest way is to take advantage 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.230
 service 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.490
 and since 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.250
 it's called kun goma 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.579
 Well, maybe not the most successful name 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.580
 Considering 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.690
 our Russian mentality 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510
 t but still service 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.580
 work 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.590
 I will post installments 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.380
 below this video in on a blog 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.510
 can take and see 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.650
 happening 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.990
 work going is simple 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.830
 we choose 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.750
 percent button cutts trio site mini eyelet 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.400
 and here we choose to whom the meter 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.450
 gummet calculation cooler sounds 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.500
 this line appears 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.050
 percent of her offside ural that is, we are here 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.240

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 tracks and check your site trying 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.619
 try gives fruit with and click on 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.030
 the red button is the mass 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.570
 such a phone appears clearly 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.659
 there they write to us what is happening this 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.400
 moment the act is uploaded and n in the end on 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.729
 the third step we have 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.060
 there will be such a picture 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.260
 all the same, our site looks 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.670
 but also ask us in a short Keti 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.490
 Mom read there 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.420
 letters 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.130
 not fresh and pictograms kiriet 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.150
 other 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.969
 ready 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340
 loaded 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.700
 it's about like this 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.459
 looks like a site 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.620
 but on mobile devices that is 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.969
 You can even say it looks normal 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:13.590
 crushes 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.379
 window 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.639
 Apparently you can close 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.009

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.730
 that is just 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.760
 the appearance of the main page can 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.519
 look 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.279
 what do you understand 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.429
 but 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:34.820
 not very comfortable 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.569
 people who are all from then there are hands 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.680
 analyze 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.580
 they will not satisfy them as we 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.739
 times for such people 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.929
 second part of this video 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.059

 with windows operating system on macs 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.859
 but in theory should not work if 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.539

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.840
 already loaded our site 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.580

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.759
 In principle, the son looks fine, but ours 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.759
