present this in my German review of the
knife<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> sheet<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:44.910> Brisa

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.340 
knife and this is the sheet that Brisa
gave<00:02:46.200> me<00:02:46.610> as<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> replacement<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.510> one<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
gave me as a replacement for this one it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.800 
gave me as a replacement for this one it
is<00:02:49.440> actually<00:02:49.769> shorter<00:02:52.130> by<00:02:53.130> maybe<00:02:53.810> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
is actually shorter by maybe a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.100 
is actually shorter by maybe a
centimeter<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.910> part<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.930> is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
centimeter here on this part it is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.729 
centimeter here on this part it is
thicker<00:02:58.380> leather<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.980> better<00:02:59.340> constructed<00:02:59.790> but

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
thicker leather a better constructed but

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.410 
thicker leather a better constructed but
you<00:03:01.739> still<00:03:02.040> do<00:03:02.280> run<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.610> risk<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.970> cutting<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
you still do run the risk of cutting the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.070 
you still do run the risk of cutting the
stitches<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.019> inside<00:03:04.319> just<00:03:05.989> have<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
stitches on the inside just have to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.130 
stitches on the inside just have to
check<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.440> however<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.190> new<00:03:08.610> sheath<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.330> much

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
check it however the new sheath is much

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.039 
check it however the new sheath is much
better<00:03:10.349> than<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> old<00:03:10.860> one

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
better than the old one

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.240 
better than the old one
as<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.349> stands<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:14.150> feel<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.660> a

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
as it stands I feel like I have a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.080 
as it stands I feel like I have a
completely<00:03:17.250> new<00:03:17.850> knife<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:20.090> all-around

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
knife I really am then believe how much

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.470 
knife I really am then believe how much
of<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.810> difference<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.560> feel<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:27.000> having<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
of a difference in feel just having the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.630 
of a difference in feel just having the
fire<00:03:27.750> steel<00:03:28.049> on<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.980> knife<00:03:29.130> made<00:03:30.090> and
