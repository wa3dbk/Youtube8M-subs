just<00:02:53.519> look<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.940> see<00:02:54.540> how<00:02:54.720> could<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
just look at it see how could it be a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.449 
just look at it see how could it be a
little<00:02:55.260> bit<00:02:55.380> better<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.920> could<00:02:56.100> be<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> little

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
little bit better it could be a little

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
little bit better it could be a little
bit<00:02:56.640> better<00:02:56.820> right<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.630> should<00:02:57.840> take<00:02:57.930> off

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
bit better right here I should take off

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.420 
bit better right here I should take off
a<00:02:58.140> little<00:02:58.290> bit<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.650> right<00:02:58.830> here<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.190> give<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
a little bit more right here to give it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.970 
a little bit more right here to give it
a<00:02:59.459> nicer<00:02:59.790> shape<00:03:00.410> since<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.560> pretty<00:03:01.650> much<00:03:01.830> I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

pretty much any other stuff in the nail
process<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.489> takes<00:03:29.610> much<00:03:29.850> longer<00:03:30.060> than<00:03:30.269> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
this just basically helps seal it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.900 
this just basically helps seal it
so<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.300> there's<00:03:49.900> no<00:03:50.110> real<00:03:50.410> spiky<00:03:50.980> edges<00:03:51.370> or

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
so that there's no real spiky edges or

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.670 
so that there's no real spiky edges or
serrated<00:03:52.270> edges<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.900> are<00:03:53.080> going<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.380> look

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
serrated edges that are going to look

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.010 
serrated edges that are going to look
ugly<00:03:53.830> with<00:03:54.100> polish<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.550> them<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.630> super

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
ugly with polish on them this is a super

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.480 
ugly with polish on them this is a super
fine<00:03:56.320> nail<00:03:56.560> file<00:03:56.770> it's<00:03:56.980> not<00:03:57.160> going<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.370> take

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
fine nail file it's not going to take

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.830 
fine nail file it's not going to take
off<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.670> lot<00:03:57.940> at<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> time<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:58.630> gonna

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
off a lot at a time it's just gonna

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.970 
off a lot at a time it's just gonna
smooth<00:03:59.140> out<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.410> edges<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.560> does<00:04:02.680> require

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
smooth out the edges so it does require

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.410 
smooth out the edges so it does require
you<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.280> have<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.670> little<00:04:04.000> bit<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.120> nail<00:04:04.270> growth

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.390 
we're actually much longer because of
the<00:04:17.019> way<00:04:17.110> that<00:04:17.260> your<00:04:17.440> nail<00:04:17.650> naturally<00:04:18.190> grows

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
the way that your nail naturally grows

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.720 
the way that your nail naturally grows
it<00:04:18.610> grows<00:04:18.730> into<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:19.180> moon<00:04:19.390> shape<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.989> so

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
it grows into this moon shape and so

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.650 
it grows into this moon shape and so
you're<00:04:21.730> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> need<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> little<00:04:22.270> bit<00:04:22.450> more
