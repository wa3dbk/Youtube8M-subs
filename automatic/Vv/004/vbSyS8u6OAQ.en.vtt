00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
basically because you understand two

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.100 
basically because you understand two
things<00:05:38.939> one<00:05:39.330> when<00:05:39.509> you're<00:05:39.599> down<00:05:39.719> out<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.930> shape

it's not an attractive feature and to
the<00:05:42.990> big<00:05:43.259> problem<00:05:43.589> the<00:05:43.650> two<00:05:43.770> is<00:05:43.860> is<00:05:44.069> you<00:05:44.430> don't

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
the big problem the two is is you don't

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.739 
the big problem the two is is you don't
really<00:05:44.759> have<00:05:44.939> real<00:05:45.120> confidence<00:05:45.509> you<00:05:45.659> know

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:45.749 
really have real confidence you know

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.320 
really have real confidence you know
people<00:05:46.050> can<00:05:46.169> see<00:05:46.379> right<00:05:46.589> through<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.979> know

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
people can see right through you know

you<00:05:52.439> or<00:05:52.589> anything<00:05:52.770> people<00:05:53.430> can<00:05:53.580> sense<00:05:53.879> if

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
you or anything people can sense if

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.490 
you or anything people can sense if
you're<00:05:54.569> not<00:05:54.659> being<00:05:54.870> true<00:05:55.020> to<00:05:55.110> who<00:05:55.139> you<00:05:55.259> are<00:05:55.349> and
