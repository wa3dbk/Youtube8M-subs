00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 I drive 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.420
 Y 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello very good to all youtube people 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.549
 here we are one more day in the worst channel 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.400
 history until today don 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.450
 TomÃ¡s Gamer and we are going to make a boxing 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.150
 the dragon ball z budokai h of collection 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.400
 and as you can see his game for 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
 playstation 3 what this game is about 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.420
 I imagine that you will all know him because 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.540
 it came out at the end of 2012 but the one that did not 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.640
 know him is the hd version of the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.260
 version of the version the hd version of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.769
 the version this does not make good sense 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.590
 the student games z budokai and bouquets 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.170
 from tamudo that there are 3 for playstation 2 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.539
 together in the same blu ray hd version 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.640
 for playstation3 with combats in 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.250
 panoramic with is not created with a lot 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.129
 of lights and new flaws super weird 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.239
 ways but the most important thing is that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.270
 those who no longer have their 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.129
 playstation 2 or have never had and 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.149
 have play if there are three and they have 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.250
 left with the desire to play this 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.800
 game here they have it totally 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.710
 remastered with new soundtrack 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.990
 what is a point 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.100
 It is not a point in favor, of course, 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.310
 that the previous soundtrack was 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.140
 amazing but hey you can play as 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.940
 ahead as we can see here is the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.909
 title of the budokai hd gazette 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.549
 collection that on the cover of what 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.820
 would be the vulgar 3 we see something with super 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.760
 saiyan 4 and here we see something in super 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.470
 saiyan and ordinary 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.290
 from behind they say welcome, I do not know 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.620
 how sharp game the most popular game of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.770
 dragon ball z in a special collection 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.600
 remastered in hd graphics and by 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 first time for the playstation system 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.330
 3 has cost a bit to read it because 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.190
 is in perfect English 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.200
 and here we go to the gesta and here we go to 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.440
 piccolo is in English because I've 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.960
 bought the imported edition because in 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 the comments said that the game is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.320
 also with the texts in Spanish 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.740
 Japanese voices and that's how I 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.740
 I want to play 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.160
 and I went ten euros more information and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.680
 hotel, I do not care if the box is 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.250
 in English in Turkish that in German that more 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.990
 they put namcobandaigames eu 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.010
 dragonball z and dragon ball z wood or that 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.470
 there are three remastered in hd the most 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.780
 acclaimed playstation 2 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.790
 here in I do not know how many with trophies 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.490
 support for trophies in playstation 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 network includes the voices in Japanese that 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.950
 It's something that touched me eggs 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.220
 that before you had to play with the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.240
 voices in English and that can not be 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.209
 apart from that the English gary so 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.650
 very much no no no it is not so epic one is 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.230
 so ethical to hear the voices of goku in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.060
 English says one or two players does not have 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.350
 online mode is a failure would have been a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.950
 last we had online but not 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.069
 has a minimum of 5 megabytes to save 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.120
 departure is vibrating with 23 and 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.910
 can play in 720p 1080i 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.880
 I asked 12 include violence 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.120
 we're going to put in with nothing else so I'm going to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.800
 proceed to open it let's start the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.800
 plastic as we can 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.340
 and the truth is that I played this game 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.370
 many, many, many hours in 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.079
 playstation 2 I have many and I have 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.269
 the playstation 2 I still have this game 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.299
 but I do not have the playstation cables 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.099
 2 and to spend myself I see 15 euros 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.799
 in the cables because I preferred to spend 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.129
 31 euros that has cost me this I have 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.849
 requested by amazon.es sent 24 hours 31 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.469
 euros and be able to play 1 and 3 because 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.260
 is not 2 because 2 was a bit 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.900
 fraud in the system that to move as 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 if it were the goose 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 I had never seen that in my life and 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.040
 Of course I do not like much we open 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.290
 and inside we have the blu-ray dvd player 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.409
 in the three things not only in blu-ray 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.739
 with the same cover here the booklet with 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.140
 the same cover and behind the booklet what 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.170
 that puts us sign up intros of your 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.790
 code earns a thousand points and choose your gift 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.750
 thousand points for namco bandai and here 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.750
 we have the blu-ray 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.520
 with the same image as on the cover 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.639
 but super super chulÃ­n drago does not accept 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.980
 budokai hd collection if you would like 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.990

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.419
 will matter because of course I'm going to 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.020
 paste hours and hours of video now in my 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.600

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.130
 that train to be the best and of that 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.900

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.790

 record me playing against them 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.070
 whatever it is if you want me to record 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.590
