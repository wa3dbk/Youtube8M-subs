warped but it's bent and I like that

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.840 
warped but it's bent and I like that
because<00:00:18.500> is<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> point<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> brand

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
because is the point this is a brand

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.420 
because is the point this is a brand
spankin<00:00:21.210> new<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.949> has<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
spankin new one and it kind of has the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.910 
spankin new one and it kind of has the
still<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> purple<00:00:24.920> weird-looking

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
still like the purple weird-looking

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
still like the purple weird-looking
finish<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.750> means<00:00:27.930> it's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
finish on it and I think that means it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
finish on it and I think that means it's
just<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> doesn't<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:30.480> oxygen

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
just because it doesn't have the oxygen

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.319 
just because it doesn't have the oxygen
hasn't<00:00:31.320> gotten<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> yet

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
hasn't gotten to it yet

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:42.770 
hasn't gotten to it yet
let's<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.540> ahead<00:00:39.980> tie<00:00:41.390> pretty<00:00:42.390> good<00:00:42.570> because

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
let's go ahead tie pretty good because

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
let's go ahead tie pretty good because
it's<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> why<00:00:43.320> there's<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.789> more

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.890 
18 inch like a Sabian hhx China 18 inch
and<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.550> cracked<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.540> thought<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and it was cracked and I thought the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.809 
and it was cracked and I thought the
cracks<00:02:18.290> might<00:02:18.680> help<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.099> lot<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.550> let's<00:02:19.700> go

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
cracks might help a lot so let's go

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.350 
cracks might help a lot so let's go
ahead<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.060> check<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.360> out<00:02:20.480> see<00:02:20.660> how<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> sounds

about yay much and this is how made
Jeannie<00:02:37.190> stacks<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.700> himself

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.270 

well<00:02:41.410> stacks<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> same<00:02:42.860> way<00:02:43.010> every<00:02:43.040> time

well stacks it the same way every time
that<00:02:43.640> sometimes<00:02:44.030> they'll<00:02:44.180> flip<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.510> upside

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.570 
that sometimes they'll flip it upside
down<00:02:44.870> depending<00:02:45.349> on<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:46.040> don't<00:02:46.790> know<00:02:47.000> why<00:02:47.239> but

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
down depending on I don't know why but

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.820 
down depending on I don't know why but
it's<00:02:49.580> what<00:02:49.849> he<00:02:50.000> does<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.830> sometimes

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's what he does so like this sometimes

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's what he does so like this sometimes
we'll<00:02:54.980> take<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> bow<00:02:59.320> what<00:03:00.320> I've<00:03:00.470> noticed<00:03:00.739> is

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
we'll take a bow what I've noticed is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.420 
we'll take a bow what I've noticed is
that<00:03:01.340> personally<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.329> get<00:03:03.430> different

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that personally you can get different

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.949 
that personally you can get different
sound<00:03:04.670> from<00:03:04.880> hitting<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.329> side<00:03:05.570> from

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
sound from hitting this side from

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.310 
sound from hitting this side from
hitting<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.739> bow<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.600> supposed<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.109> just

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
hitting the bow and supposed to just

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.479 
hitting the bow and supposed to just
being<00:03:09.530> able<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.799> hit<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> edge<00:03:10.130> on<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.400> other

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
being able to hit the edge on the other

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.599 
being able to hit the edge on the other
side<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:12.100> something<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.160> think<00:03:13.250> about

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
side so something to think about

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.840 
side so something to think about
let's<00:03:14.180> go<00:03:14.329> ahead<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.630> test<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.079> way

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
let's go ahead and test it this way

00:03:15.850 --> 00:04:17.189 
let's go ahead and test it this way
first

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.069 

all<00:04:18.199> right<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:19.030> that's<00:04:20.030> one<00:04:20.359> direction<00:04:20.539> let's

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
all right so that's one direction let's

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.240 
all right so that's one direction let's
flip<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.440> over<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.709> see<00:04:21.889> what<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
flip it over and see what the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:34.930 
flip it over and see what the
differences<00:04:22.729> are<00:04:32.949> if<00:04:33.949> you<00:04:34.460> want<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:34.729> preserve

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
differences are if you want to preserve

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.029 
differences are if you want to preserve
your<00:04:35.180> already<00:04:35.840> cracked<00:04:36.139> China<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.620> little<00:04:36.889> bit

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
your already cracked China a little bit
