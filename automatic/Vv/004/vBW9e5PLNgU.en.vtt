00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.460

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.040

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.590
 because it would only have the objective 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.290

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.460

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.340
 Laguna is waiting for the pencils and the 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.900
