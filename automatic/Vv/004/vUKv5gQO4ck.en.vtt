00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 with 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.740
 Our government has been in Sao Paulo for almost four years. 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.769
 has been Brazilian champion twice with the tricolor shirt 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.980
 I never received the attacker playing as much of a good match with life as homicide 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.149
 first months of 2011 I'm living in the sea one phase personally 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.439
 very good reflecting 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.420
 very within the campogo has already had 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.710
 the companion of attack of the paulo players like adriano 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.470
 the taste of Victor brandão 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.870
 but his style of play never fit so well as now alongside 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.770
 fernandinho 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.570
 and democracy, I arrived in Sao Paulo 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.810
 the athletic paranaense but we have players that played this way the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.500
 jadson guy here 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 I always spoke and I say it's a guy that one day I go 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.040
 I go another option is again to play with him because he is a guy who me 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.900
 understood and today the motorcycle committee with Lucas 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.320
 with fernandinho if são paulo hired me he saw that player who 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.900
 you know today you see in a way where 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.130
 many times we did not have Alex's help resembling that quality 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.340
 so the way Sao Paulo is playing today make sure that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.770
 I just something very much and greatly facilitates my my game definitely the dagoberto 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.940
 which is at the disposal of paulo césar carpegiani 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.090
 it is not the same that was under the command of muricy streak 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 ricardo gomes de sérgio baresi 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.079
 most of the time before he had at his side a tall, heavy attacker 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.450
 with whom he always had difficulties 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.760
 to adjust 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.720
 but it was not only because it is a defensive part because always 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.899
 a very important point in Sao Paulo, it is that many times I 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.690
 I had to try to learn this however does not mean that the current team 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.740
 from carpegiani 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 do not have defensive worries 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.440
 if it is fair or not it is important to say that the team today a team more 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.410
 solid 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.140
 the team that takes very few goals the team got now people are 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.890
 due to light 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.989
 the grouping of all players the players by the commitment in the marking 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.189
 this makes it easier for us defenders, the truth is that 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.129
 will 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.859
 alongside fast and skilled players 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.859
 with characteristics similar to his 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.939
 the team is still far from being champion 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.349
 but for the attacker is playing better more beautiful 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.999
 the Brazilian three-time champion for many people is an ox if he gets out of his mind 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.739
 Nowadays it's very easy for you, the horse that knows where you're going to get 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.079
 the day ceará also treated very hopeful with 'very happy' 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.739
 What have you been doing for? 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.749
 for you come to a title you have to 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.840
 have to show a title football and that team has been showing the team comes 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.079
 showing 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.120
 I'm going to the pot, very safe, very firm. 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.619
 if you watched sao paulo 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.809
 I used to sleep 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:02.139
 the great truth is this
