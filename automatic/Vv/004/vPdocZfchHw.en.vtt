considered<00:02:32.530> dropping<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.340> after<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.910> little

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
considered dropping it after a little

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.550 
considered dropping it after a little
while<00:02:34.240> but<00:02:34.540> then<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:35.170> sort<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.380> caught

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
while but then that sort of caught

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.170 
while but then that sort of caught
myself<00:02:35.950> up<00:02:36.100> on<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.430> once<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.700> really<00:02:36.880> sit

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
myself up on it and once you really sit

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.910 
myself up on it and once you really sit
down<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.600> look<00:02:37.870> at<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.290> does<00:02:38.440> tend<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.830> make

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
down and look at it it does tend to make

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.449 
down and look at it it does tend to make
sense

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
sense

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.090 
sense
so<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> guess<00:02:40.420> Secret<00:02:41.140> Wars<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.500> gonna<00:02:41.770> be<00:02:41.950> all

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
teasing the Toni Steve I guess for cuz

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.080 
teasing the Toni Steve I guess for cuz
the<00:03:02.080> Civil<00:03:02.380> War<00:03:02.410> comes<00:03:02.830> out<00:03:03.010> next<00:03:03.190> year<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:04.060> I
