00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 in the aftermath the Atlantic but who 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.890
 have sinking into the land itself 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.569
 turns into snow and that's what will 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.610
 to happen today between the limousin 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.110
 is the Midi Pyrenees region of snow 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 also on the Pyrenees with this fort 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.380
 risk of avalanches I remind him to have 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 already on the roads are open 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.380
 it 's not safe to 100 like that so we 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.650
 share a little bit in the front that I joined 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.920
 the adventured with the Rennes wait this is 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920
 perfect 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.550
 there are some cutlery so we are good 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.730
 we will be able to go it snow 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 cool 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.940
 good little disappointing enough short 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.670
 but really nice with little of the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.530
 powder without a single trace so that 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.960
 it's really the pinnacle of snowboarding and 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 than gliding like surfing it's 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.820
 the same now we will do the same 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.820
 thing on the water
