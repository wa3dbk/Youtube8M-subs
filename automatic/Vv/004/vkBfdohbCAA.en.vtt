00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500

 I bought huskies and they did not give me a fig 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.409

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.970
 I ordered like a video about the kit

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.820

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.759

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.950
 I had about five hundred views on 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.130
 this video after he put 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.289
 Like the time passed for a couple of days came running 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.759
 more views here in this case, 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.840
 3030 97 let's say so let's 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.000
 its was further considered 3000 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 views he made me three thousand 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.350
 views he did not do for three thousand 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.040
 rubles 1 view 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.019
 1 ruble but it would not be so bad if 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.519
 would 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.330
 the number of subscribers to the same interest 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.970
 subscribers 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.000
 let's see the statistics number 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.880
 views 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.120
 3329 time passed three days quiet to know 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.400
 don't know it means framed 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.850
 subscriptions 2 subscriptions 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.060
 Stuffing mother and subscriptions from the channel 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.060
 which 2 subscribers and a half Lema 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.819
 some kind of tin is well maybe someone 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.870
 then went to the channel looked 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.299
 signed shorter i looked there for here 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.290
 these few days after which higher 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:06.060
 light stones signed jester about ten 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 whether 15 people with this fire 20 20 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.860
 and we divide thousands of rubles by 20 we get 150 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.600
 rubles for one subscriber 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.600
 our this inexplicable feeling 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.250
 explain Odessa language it seems 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.860
 it's just what not to convey to me 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
 it seems and this world seems so with my 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.840
 point of view it seems you 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.510
 imagine what tin 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.940
 in short guys like never never 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.450
 buy everything hammer what was not 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.380
 the sweet price of likes is scoring 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.600
 the only thing is that if you want 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.459
 sell to someone like you can sell 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.500
 your like making money on it but 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.410
 if you want subscribers to attract yourself 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.330
 likes does not work about it probably already 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.790
 said many bloggers and I don't 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.280
 join likes don't work them not 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.650
 buy even for such a cheap price 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.530
 guys like iwangai 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.150
 here you see more in different 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:19.780
 the statistics will show you what's above like 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:23.890
 views on this video is 700 more on 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.690
 next day heart 800 200 everything and 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.970
 went down, that is, from 1 4 5 days 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.830
 Any advertisement is active. 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.830
 peak in the first 2 days and further 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.790
 the next three four days go the same 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.270
 flying birds water is such a garbage 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.880
 again let's not confuse my opinion on 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.610
 about advertising and about creativity 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.860
 one or another blogger for and wang not 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.340
 Watching not looking easy I learned that 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.800
 sells likes therefore 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.449
 ordering as a blogger is probably good if 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.930
 has such a popularity 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.300
 if he has subscribers but he has advertising 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.419
 book will no longer his to me 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.729
 recommends want to check please 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.750
 if my video was useful somehow 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.199
 protect you from wasting money on me 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.919
 it will be nice that I even someone 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:21.520
 sent on the path of truth on this all up 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.520
 new meetings
