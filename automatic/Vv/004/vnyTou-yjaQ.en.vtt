upgrade<00:00:06.950> on<00:00:07.279> a<00:00:07.340> design<00:00:08.090> J<00:00:08.300> holders<00:00:08.950> so<00:00:09.950> before

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
upgrade on a design J holders so before

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.890 
upgrade on a design J holders so before
we<00:00:10.429> start<00:00:10.700> make<00:00:11.450> sure<00:00:11.570> we've<00:00:11.720> got<00:00:11.750> some

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
we start make sure we've got some

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.009 
we start make sure we've got some
suitable<00:00:12.590> ESD<00:00:13.220> protection<00:00:14.380> here<00:00:16.330> and<00:00:17.330> make

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
suitable ESD protection here and make

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.390 
suitable ESD protection here and make
sure<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.230> power<00:00:18.439> is<00:00:18.500> disconnected<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.249> has

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
sure the power is disconnected and has

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.370 
sure the power is disconnected and has
been<00:00:19.640> for<00:00:19.880> good<00:00:20.240> sort<00:00:20.449> of<00:00:20.480> 20<00:00:20.749> minutes<00:00:20.869> half<00:00:21.259> an

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
hour people you remove the power okay so

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.409 
hour people you remove the power okay so
we're<00:00:25.220> looking<00:00:25.669> on<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:25.999> back<00:00:26.150> of<00:00:26.300> the

the<00:01:12.530> memory<00:01:12.710> pops<00:01:13.040> up<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.370> an<00:01:13.460> angle<00:01:13.550> of<00:01:13.760> about

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
the memory pops up to an angle of about

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.930
