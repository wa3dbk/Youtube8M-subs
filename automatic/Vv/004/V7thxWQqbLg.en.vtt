that sounded like

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.060 
that sounded like
and<00:01:42.830> for<00:01:43.340> everything<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:43.970> we<00:01:44.090> did<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:45.070> decided

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and for everything that we did I decided

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.410 
and for everything that we did I decided
to<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:48.110> very<00:01:48.740> low<00:01:49.070> gain<00:01:49.490> very<00:01:49.910> low<00:01:50.119> volume

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
to do a very low gain very low volume

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.520

everything<00:01:51.050> was<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.290> 7<00:01:51.740> watts<00:01:51.979> today<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.530> we

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
everything was on 7 watts today and we

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.280 
everything was on 7 watts today and we
also<00:01:54.740> look<00:01:55.100> at<00:01:55.160> where<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> volume<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:56.290> super

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
built on the architecture of a rocker

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.449 
built on the architecture of a rocker
verb<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:08.020> no<00:02:09.020> need<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:10.010> have<00:02:10.040> something

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
that blasts at full volume because we

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.930 
that blasts at full volume because we
know<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.380> that's<00:02:12.560> all<00:02:12.680> about<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.220> know<00:02:13.760> this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
know what that's all about you know this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.300 
know what that's all about you know this
is<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.140> smaller<00:02:15.530> version

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
is really you know the smaller version

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.770 
is really you know the smaller version
of<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.459> whether<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> practice<00:02:17.420> amp<00:02:17.630> or

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
of that whether it's a practice amp or

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.140 
of that whether it's a practice amp or
for<00:02:17.930> rehearsals<00:02:18.500> or<00:02:18.709> recording<00:02:19.310> amp<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:20.060> I

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
for rehearsals or recording amp and I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.509 
for rehearsals or recording amp and I
think<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:20.480> great

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
think it's great

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.009 
think it's great
pretty<00:02:22.519> much<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.820> all<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> terrorist

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
pretty much like all of the terrorist

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.470 
pretty much like all of the terrorist
stuff<00:02:24.260> except<00:02:24.830> it's<00:02:25.730> based<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> rocker

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
stuff except it's based on the rocker

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.420 
stuff except it's based on the rocker
verb<00:02:26.780> architecture<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.860> voiced<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.280> bit

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
verb architecture so it's voiced a bit

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.550 
verb architecture so it's voiced a bit
more<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.480> everything<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.200> pretty

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
more like that so everything I pretty

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.979 
more like that so everything I pretty
much<00:02:30.680> left<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:32.360> around

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
much left it right around

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.570 
much left it right around
