00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
inflammation which in turn causes

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.760 
inflammation which in turn causes
chronic<00:00:30.939> diseases<00:00:31.449> that's<00:00:32.079> how<00:00:32.260> simple<00:00:32.320> it<00:00:32.710> is

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
chronic diseases that's how simple it is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.340 
chronic diseases that's how simple it is
but<00:00:33.280> this<00:00:33.460> is<00:00:33.670> why<00:00:33.850> they<00:00:33.930> their<00:00:34.930> claimed<00:00:35.230> a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
but this is why they their claimed a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.780 
but this is why they their claimed a
famous<00:00:35.680> this<00:00:35.860> is<00:00:35.980> what<00:00:36.160> they're<00:00:36.310> saying<00:00:36.610> to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
famous this is what they're saying to

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.300 
famous this is what they're saying to
you<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.630> reason<00:00:38.020> why<00:00:38.260> bread<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.830> so<00:00:39.100> much<00:00:39.280> more

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
you the reason why bread is so much more

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.830 
you the reason why bread is so much more
unhealthy<00:00:40.030> then<00:00:41.490> then<00:00:42.490> wheat<00:00:43.390> bread<00:00:43.660> is

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
unhealthy then then wheat bread is

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.650 
unhealthy then then wheat bread is
because<00:00:44.290> there's<00:00:45.040> no<00:00:45.250> fiber<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.910> well

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
because there's no fiber in it well

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.930 
because there's no fiber in it well
that's<00:00:46.990> true<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.650> really<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.160> because<00:00:48.550> there's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
that's true it really is because there's

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.230 
that's true it really is because there's
no<00:00:49.090> fiber<00:00:49.360> in<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.720> all<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.590> starches<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.550> all

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
no fiber in it all the starches and all

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.090 
no fiber in it all the starches and all
that<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.690> obviously<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.290> processed<00:00:53.800> more

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
that and obviously it's processed more

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.370 
that and obviously it's processed more
and<00:00:54.910> all<00:00:55.060> that<00:00:55.240> the<00:00:55.570> sugar<00:00:55.810> that's<00:00:56.020> in<00:00:56.200> there

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
and all that the sugar that's in there

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.720 
and all that the sugar that's in there
and<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.560> fats<00:00:56.830> are<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:58.500> absorbed<00:00:59.550> at<00:01:00.550> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
and the fats are are absorbed at a

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.700 
and the fats are are absorbed at a
higher<00:01:00.940> capacity<00:01:01.720> now<00:01:02.079> when<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.380> comes<00:01:02.530> to

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
higher capacity now when it comes to

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.649 
higher capacity now when it comes to
wheat<00:01:02.920> bread<00:01:03.220> because<00:01:03.490> it<00:01:03.850> has<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.119> husk<00:01:04.330> over

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
wheat bread because it has to husk over

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.750 
wheat bread because it has to husk over
the<00:01:04.750> week<00:01:04.900> there's<00:01:05.710> less<00:01:06.010> absorption<00:01:06.460> because

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
the week there's less absorption because

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.450 
the week there's less absorption because
the<00:01:07.030> week<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.750> falls<00:01:08.230> it<00:01:08.560> when<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.190> goes<00:01:09.310> into

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the week it falls it when it goes into

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.340 
the week it falls it when it goes into
intestinal<00:01:09.880> tract<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.240> week<00:01:10.420> may<00:01:10.900> not<00:01:11.110> fall

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
intestinal tract the week may not fall

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.310 
intestinal tract the week may not fall
off<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.740> grain<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:13.360> turn<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.930> passes

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
off the grain and in turn it passes

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.520 
off the grain and in turn it passes
right<00:01:14.440> through<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.909> there<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.810> starches

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
right through you but there is starches

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.760 
right through you but there is starches
there<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.970> hasn't<00:01:19.210> changed<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.810> bit<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
there and that hasn't changed a bit the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.380 
there and that hasn't changed a bit the
starches<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.310> still<00:01:21.580> in<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:22.000> wheat<00:01:22.150> bread

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
starches are still in the wheat bread

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.730 
starches are still in the wheat bread
the<00:01:22.570> starches<00:01:22.810> are<00:01:23.020> still<00:01:23.260> in<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.590> white

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the starches are still in the white

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.010 
the starches are still in the white
bread<00:01:24.010> both<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.820> starches<00:01:25.150> are<00:01:25.330> very

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
bread both of the starches are very

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.320 
bread both of the starches are very
unhealthy<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:26.680> there<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.760> no<00:01:27.909> difference

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
unhealthy to you there is no difference

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.750 
unhealthy to you there is no difference
here<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:29.049> for<00:01:29.500> them<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.770> say<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.159> wheat<00:01:30.549> bread

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
here so for them to say that wheat bread

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.850 
here so for them to say that wheat bread
is<00:01:30.850> healthy<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.659> an<00:01:31.870> absolute<00:01:32.290> lie<00:01:32.530> it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
is healthy it is an absolute lie it

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.410 
is healthy it is an absolute lie it
isn't<00:01:33.190> healthy<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:33.640> causes<00:01:34.000> inflammation

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
isn't healthy it causes inflammation

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.300 
isn't healthy it causes inflammation
which<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.350> turn<00:01:35.560> breaks<00:01:35.799> down<00:01:35.950> your<00:01:36.130> immune

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
which in turn breaks down your immune

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.670 
which in turn breaks down your immune
system<00:01:36.549> which<00:01:37.090> in<00:01:37.270> turn<00:01:37.510> allows<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.560> get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
system which in turn allows you to get

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.330 
system which in turn allows you to get
sick<00:01:39.659> both<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.840> them<00:01:40.900> do<00:01:41.110> not<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:42.100> white

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
sick both of them do not just white

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.700 
sick both of them do not just white
bread<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:43.119> does<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.450> same<00:01:43.479> thing<00:01:43.900> so<00:01:44.380> don't

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
bread it does the same thing so don't

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.740 
bread it does the same thing so don't
believe<00:01:45.100> them<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:46.030> fact<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.420> matter<00:01:46.510> is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
believe them the fact of the matter is

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.230 
believe them the fact of the matter is
that<00:01:46.869> wheat<00:01:47.799> or<00:01:48.040> white<00:01:48.130> you're<00:01:48.909> going<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.150> get

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
that wheat or white you're going to get

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.640 
that wheat or white you're going to get
inflammation<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:50.170> might<00:01:50.290> get<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.470> little

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
inflammation you just might get a little

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.070 
inflammation you just might get a little
bit<00:01:50.799> more<00:01:51.010> from<00:01:51.520> white<00:01:52.000> bread<00:01:52.240> but<00:01:52.960> you're

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
bit more from white bread but you're

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.800 
bit more from white bread but you're
still<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.470> get<00:01:53.560> inflammation<00:01:53.830> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
still going to get inflammation so
