00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.770 
game NEX and I have got a brand new
glitch<00:00:17.920> this<00:00:18.310> is<00:00:18.490> on<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.820> new<00:00:19.000> map<00:00:19.240> origins

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
glitch this is on the new map origins

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.180 
glitch this is on the new map origins
and<00:00:19.960> it<00:00:20.080> is<00:00:20.170> outside<00:00:20.620> of<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.860> map<00:00:21.010> already

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
and it is outside of the map already

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.610 
and it is outside of the map already
this<00:00:21.490> is<00:00:21.670> on<00:00:21.790> my<00:00:22.210> first<00:00:22.570> game<00:00:22.870> on<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.170> map<00:00:23.440> and

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
this is on my first game on the map and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.960 
this is on my first game on the map and
I've<00:00:23.800> managed<00:00:24.040> to<00:00:24.070> get<00:00:24.370> out<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.640> the<00:00:24.760> map<00:00:24.940> so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
I've managed to get out of the map so

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.840 
I've managed to get out of the map so
it's<00:00:25.870> reasonably<00:00:26.560> easy<00:00:26.620> to<00:00:26.920> do<00:00:27.190> I<00:00:27.430> haven't

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
it's reasonably easy to do I haven't

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.970 
it's reasonably easy to do I haven't
seen<00:00:28.120> too<00:00:28.810> many<00:00:28.840> places<00:00:29.170> wait<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.680> get<00:00:29.830> from

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
seen too many places wait and get from

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.529 
seen too many places wait and get from
it<00:00:30.070> yet<00:00:30.220> but<00:00:30.460> obviously<00:00:30.730> I<00:00:30.789> would<00:00:31.150> say<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.420> them

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
it yet but obviously I would say to them

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.319 
it yet but obviously I would say to them
up<00:00:31.690> so<00:00:31.870> you<00:00:31.990> can't<00:00:32.200> be<00:00:32.320> killed<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.910> I'll<00:00:33.910> be

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
up so you can't be killed and I'll be

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.790

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
able to show you where you can get and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.980 
able to show you where you can get and
stuff<00:00:36.130> hopefully<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:36.820> later<00:00:37.000> videos<00:00:37.420> because

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
stuff hopefully in later videos because

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.750 
stuff hopefully in later videos because
you'll<00:00:38.770> see<00:00:38.950> in<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.070> moment<00:00:39.220> I<00:00:39.430> ran<00:00:39.610> away

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
you'll see in a moment I ran away

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.640 
you'll see in a moment I ran away
because<00:00:39.880> I<00:00:40.060> got<00:00:40.180> excited<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:40.660> then<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.260> hit<00:00:41.620> a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
because I got excited and then I hit a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.590 
because I got excited and then I hit a
death<00:00:41.920> barrier<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:42.880> obviously<00:00:43.210> if<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.360> stay

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
death barrier but obviously if you stay

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.350 
death barrier but obviously if you stay
where<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.810> was<00:00:44.110> or<00:00:44.410> within<00:00:44.770> about<00:00:45.030> four<00:00:46.030> meters

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
where I was or within about four meters

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.870 
where I was or within about four meters
or<00:00:46.510> something<00:00:46.870> you're<00:00:47.110> not<00:00:47.380> gonna<00:00:47.560> die<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.399> so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880

or something you're not gonna die and so
all<00:00:49.180> you're<00:00:49.329> gonna<00:00:49.420> need<00:00:49.510> for<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:49.899> glitch<00:00:50.079> is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
all you're gonna need for this glitch is

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.690 
all you're gonna need for this glitch is
gonna<00:00:50.440> be<00:00:50.560> riding<00:00:50.860> on<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.070> tongue<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.579> then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
have enough points so you will see is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.780 
have enough points so you will see is
running<00:01:08.799> around<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.159> little<00:01:09.280> bit

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
running around a little bit

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.550 
running around a little bit
picking<00:01:10.060> up<00:01:10.120> random<00:01:10.479> stuff<00:01:10.510> off<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.290> snare

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
picking up random stuff off the snare

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.630 
picking up random stuff off the snare
because<00:01:11.799> this<00:01:11.920> was<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.340> field<00:01:12.520> as

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
because this was on the field as

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.399 
because this was on the field as
obviously<00:01:12.970> can't<00:01:13.120> see<00:01:13.299> it<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.170> will<00:01:14.200> see

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
obviously can't see it but you will see

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.660 
obviously can't see it but you will see
it's<00:01:14.530> picking<00:01:14.680> up<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:15.070> random<00:01:15.220> things

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
it's picking up some random things

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.039 
it's picking up some random things
because<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.090> was<00:01:16.180> my<00:01:16.299> first<00:01:16.450> game<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:16.720> was<00:01:16.930> just
