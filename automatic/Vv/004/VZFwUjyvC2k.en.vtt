sensor<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> thermocouple

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sensor it's a thermocouple

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
sensor it's a thermocouple
so<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> does<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> detects<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> flame

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so what it does it detects if the flame

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
so what it does it detects if the flame
goes<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.920> once<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> flame<00:01:08.610> goes<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
goes out once the flame goes out this

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
goes out once the flame goes out this
simply<00:01:09.600> turns<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> gas<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:11.159> here

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
simply turns the gas off down here

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.830
