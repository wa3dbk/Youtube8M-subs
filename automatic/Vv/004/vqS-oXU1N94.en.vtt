00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
at any injuries in the shoulders lower

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.390 
at any injuries in the shoulders lower
back<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.380> higher<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.769> handlebars<00:02:12.100> are<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
back the higher the handlebars are the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
back the higher the handlebars are the
more<00:02:12.519> upright<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:13.030> ride<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.350> little

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
more upright you ride so it's a little

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.720 
more upright you ride so it's a little
easier<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.920> get<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> shoulder<00:02:15.310> blades<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
easier to get the shoulder blades on the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.990 
easier to get the shoulder blades on the

the<00:02:19.000> further<00:02:19.180> down<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.569> handlebars<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.019> you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the further down the handlebars are you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.809 
the further down the handlebars are you
a<00:02:20.260> little<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.500> more<00:02:20.590> tough<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.519> it's<00:02:21.670> really

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
a little bit more tough so it's really

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.400 
a little bit more tough so it's really
just<00:02:21.940> preference<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.630> you're<00:02:22.750> sort<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.050> you

just preference if you're sort of you

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.050 
just preference if you're sort of you
know<00:02:23.440> I'm<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:23.950> sure<00:02:24.010> where<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.489> I'll

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
know I'm not sure where to be I'll

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.340 
know I'm not sure where to be I'll
usually<00:02:25.239> put<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.750> middle<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.080> then<00:02:26.230> if

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
usually put it in the middle and then if

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.870 
usually put it in the middle and then if
they<00:02:26.440> feel<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:27.220> too<00:02:27.400> low<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> high

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
they feel like that's too low to high

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.580 
they feel like that's too low to high
I'll<00:02:28.330> adjust<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.720> from<00:02:28.780> there

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.750 

so<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.620> know<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.100> we're<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.340> class<00:02:33.489> there

might<00:04:02.549> add<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> little<00:04:02.849> bit<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.239> resistance<00:04:03.450> at

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
might add a little bit of resistance at

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
might add a little bit of resistance at
this<00:04:03.840> point<00:04:04.079> for<00:04:04.260> more<00:04:04.409> stability<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.250> you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
this point for more stability but you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.369 
this point for more stability but you
literally<00:04:05.639> lift<00:04:06.030> right<00:04:06.209> off<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.450> saddle<00:04:06.629> we

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
literally lift right off the saddle we

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.920 
literally lift right off the saddle we
call<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.739> jog<00:04:08.010> okay<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:09.689> we<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
call it a jog okay and then we go to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.509 
call it a jog okay and then we go to
third<00:04:10.200> position<00:04:10.349> which<00:04:10.859> might<00:04:11.280> add<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> little

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
third position which might add a little

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.610 
third position which might add a little
bit<00:04:11.819> more<00:04:11.849> resistant<00:04:12.389> time<00:04:12.540> okay<00:04:12.989> again<00:04:13.379> hips

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
bit more resistant time okay again hips

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.050 
bit more resistant time okay again hips
stay<00:04:13.859> back<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.370> want<00:04:14.519> your<00:04:14.609> butt<00:04:14.790> right
