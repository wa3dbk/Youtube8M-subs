00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.059
 Hi everyone, today I'm going to talk about what 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.940
 which are the temporary colorations or 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 fleeting call coloring tone about 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.029
 tone and how important it is to work 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.420
 this coloration for people who are 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.640
 allergic and that can not be done 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.349
 technical work the good thing about the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.800
 tone on tone coloration is that no 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.500
 contains ammonia and what is important is 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.720
 know the procedure how to apply 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.420
 the color 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 the next ones already positive that I'm going to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.710
 show let's see how to perform the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.340
 tone above all 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.400
 characteristics of the colorations 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.680
 temporary tone on tone carry 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.960
 active ingredients to condition 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.480
 protect and help comb the hair 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.329
 the current ones also incorporate filters 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 solar are very simple products of 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.600
 Quick application between 5 and 15 minutes and 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.309
 with the least possible toxicity 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.470
 pretends that its effect lasts from two to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.440
 three washes and they must be resistant to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.150
 sweat moisture and rain its components 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.700
 they should keep the tone for about 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560
 how many washes the tone mechanism 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.240
 above all it is not to not penetrate the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.399
 cortex unlike tincture 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.640
 traditional that if it penetrates the cut 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.070
 They are deposited over the cuticle 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.440
 evaporate the alcoholic excipient that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.810
 contains once deposited in the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.090
 cuticle the active principle to I am cost 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.890
 oxidized by contact with air is 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 swells up and gets caught between 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.850
 cuticle scales criteria 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.820
 selection will be used in people 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.310
 allergic to the semi dyes or 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.770
 permanent when you want to give only one 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.079
 shine or nuance to the hair also we 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 It serves to qualify a little 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.380
 for those people who want a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.390
 fast dye easy to remove and not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.970
 damaged the hair I think this is the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.250
 best option and the way of application is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.340
 Very easy to apply on hair 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.619
 dry and hairstyle has to be clean 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
 that there are no remains of colored lacquers 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.690
 in spray and has and in this way the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.569
 application form is going to be rooted to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.580
 tip is going to massage and then we leave 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.190
 an exposure time depending on 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.440
 the brand that we are going to use we are going to 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 rinse, let's wash with a shampoo and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.459
 a cream and ready 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 nothing more than that is very easy too 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.440
 another important thing is that the tone 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 on tone unlike tincture 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 permanent is that a hat is placed 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.950
 to give 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.770
