00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 

I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.900> are<00:01:51.930> made<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.350> each<00:01:52.470> other<00:01:52.590> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I think they are made for each other you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.999 
I think they are made for each other you
have<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> special<00:01:54.210> clique<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:55.530> persons

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
have this special clique with persons

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
have this special clique with persons
but<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> horse<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.960> I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
but you have it also with a horse and I

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.720 
but you have it also with a horse and I
think<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.650> they<00:01:58.830> have

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.680 

you<00:02:05.360> feel<00:02:05.630> like<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.650> when<00:02:07.370> he<00:02:07.880> was<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> human<00:02:08.480> I

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you feel like it's when he was a human I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.630 
you feel like it's when he was a human I
would<00:02:08.930> take<00:02:09.110> him<00:02:09.260> home<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.740> he<00:02:10.100> can<00:02:10.280> sleep<00:02:10.400> in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
would take him home and he can sleep in

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
would take him home and he can sleep in
my<00:02:10.760> bed<00:02:10.790> there<00:02:11.270> was<00:02:11.390> no<00:02:11.540> problem<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.050> okay

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
my bed there was no problem but okay

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.680 
my bed there was no problem but okay
he's<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.100> bit<00:02:13.190> big<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.090> yeah<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
he's a little bit big for that so yeah I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
he's a little bit big for that so yeah I
don't<00:02:14.930> know<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:15.350> exactly<00:02:15.470> what<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.100> it's

difficult<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.970> explain

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
difficult to explain

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.930

he's always yeah happy and that's yeah
the<00:02:20.240> way<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> think<00:02:21.440> okay
