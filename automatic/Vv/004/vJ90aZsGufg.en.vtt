00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 I'm matheus machado and I'm going today. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.910
 teach you how to draw a rose 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 if you turn on initially make a curve 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 left in this two squares and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.390
 make another mirror to the right one 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 little like this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 the drawing is kind of a key 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 but with the tip facing down 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 try to imagine a circle that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 will guide you to draw two 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 winding curves just above now makes a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 very narrow key 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.430
 but with the longest right side without 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.739
 forget the way I get there spend a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.960
 even closer with the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.110
 long right 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.390
 finish with a trapeze just like that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.399
 still think of the type make a new one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.270
 key just below 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.129
 and cones just right having as 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 guidance an elite 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.549
 let's now make the outline and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.549
 cell irregularities 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.509
 to make the fashion fold of each party 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.159
 let's make a dash under the keys 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.040
 that they had previously drawn 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.580
 Trying to make the shift has smooth 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.610
 and well delineated each new edge 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.060
 should be narrower than the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.060
 previous 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.560
 a hint to leave the uniform stroke is 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.560
 make the stroke in a single rhythm 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.140
 base is the wheel axis starts to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.630
 to draw wheel acephalas watch out for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.630
 that points to them look fine 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.730
 to calculate the rose while the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 center of the rose and make two curves 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.110
 Famous for Down 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 the two must be parallel to each other. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.900
 excite keep pace to make 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.840
 drawn peace now 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.080
 the profile of the sheets as shown in 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080
 video 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.840
 from now on we will draw the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.480
 things 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.879
 this is the first one that will be the largest 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.939
 precisely because it is closer 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.040
 of its value 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:20.689
 this other is the one that is further away 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.879
 so it will be smaller sheet the case 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:27.790
 in the leaves is precisely to 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.790
 to simulate the irregular contour of the leaves 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.000
 we finally finished drawing on the ball 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.010
 so this is nice if you were by 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.659
 Come tell me I let it go 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.629
 if it is your first visit to our 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.629
 channel but to sign up to max
