00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.760
 how are you telling us how does the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.690
 process to bring this beer to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.250
 our country 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.440
 well the process was a process that took 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.420
 about 1 year we start first 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.790
 investigate the Peruvian set to 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.080
 understand if indeed in Peru 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.550
 he recognized German beer too 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.050
 as the best beer in the world 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.850
 and we confirm it the Peruvian consumer 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.770
 also recognized and established the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.210
 premise with this team here that was 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.220
 the product has to be produced in 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 the Peru and there began the conversation with 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.739
 the German team that also had 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.420
 interest in bringing your product to 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.430
 america latin but they did not know in what 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.680
 country and we began to show you that the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 Peru had all the credentials for 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.879
 to receive that mark to be able the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.410
 first country in latin america to receive 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.449
 the production of the female logo we do not have 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.559
 a plant with capacity we have a 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.110
 brewmaster who was the teacher 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820
 brewer best qualified in the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.890
 world contest that makes ab inbev 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.240
 sorry the third best qualified 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.420
 worldwide and the best in america 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.980
 America and also show him the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.840
 journalist is growing economically and 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.450
 had a lot of development potential for 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.250
 forward and finally we had 95 by 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.560
 percent in the market to capture and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.210
 when we achieve it 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.000
 convince them to bring the product to 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.040
 here we started a launch plan 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.700
 we started to develop with them the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.130
 launch plan to show the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.869
 consumers wants that product we are 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.149
 two commercials we want everything all the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.100
 marketing mix and we started after the 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.689
 process of plant integration with the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.670
 team from germany the most 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.100
 important of the process was to adapt the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.140
 German liquid to the palate the Peruvian 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 because the island motto of its liquid very 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.549
 bitter very strong very heavy 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 and it is a success there then what we have 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.420
 fact was we grabbed the German recipe and 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.340
 those roots we start making adjustments 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.310
 fine to be able to adapt to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.350
 Peruvian palate and there that final liquid 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.640
 I have produced 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.190
 we went to test it with the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.319
 consumers and we teach you the ligres and 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 the liquid performa very well was not very 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.769
 good except for consumers and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.530
 we are sure that we had a good 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.330
 liquid a spectacular brand a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.459
 the best quality beer 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.680
 processes in the best plant and a market 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.360
 to offer and there was to bet on the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.940
 investment the truth is that he can 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.950
 do the typical 360 plan not so 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.140
 aims to have all the points 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 contact of the covered consumer 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.410
 then we will be with television 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.300
 massive in a few weeks the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 TV commercial we are already in 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.750
 radio we are responsible for the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.550
 Soccer broadcast in Peru 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 then on weekends those that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.180
 attend football matches not going to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.980

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 beer what in brawn we have also the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 part of newspapers are already in must 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.010
 per review some newspapers 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.300
 of the Peruvian market and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.040
 we are also betting on the media 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.480
 not traditional because they are very 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.640
 important to tell stories that 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.049
 They are little longer 9 Suarez than after 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.400
 of pity a little more interaction with 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.560
 the consumer then that we're 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.989
 doing the German team as it knows well 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.579

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.160
 experience of the Germans and the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.440
 validation of the process here in Peru 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.269
 we have also done the same we sent the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.310
 brewing master for germany and a 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.349
 team of Peruvians for germany to 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.299

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.290

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.180
 all of that all this experience we are 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.030
 producing for an environment 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.470
 digital and we're going to launch some days 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.870
