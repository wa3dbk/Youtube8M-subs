00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.500
 This is the craziest story that comes to mind. 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 I was on tour with War. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.960
 Everything was going well and I really gave everything I had. 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 But Lonnie, the leader of the group, 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.680
 I was becoming more and more comfortable. 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.060
 In Seattle, Lonnie addresses the audience: 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.620
 "We are excited to be in Seattle. 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.820
 We were the last group to play with Jimi Hendrix on the night of his death. " 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.780
 It is true. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.520
 Then Lonnie adds: 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.640
 "Our guitarist wants to pay tribute to him by playing something. Go ahead, JB. " 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.640
 I was there, dying on stage. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.180
 And I went there ... 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.660
 Without refinement, almost like Lightnin 'Hopkins. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 It was raw from raw but the public liked it and it helped me. 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.620
 I was really carried by him. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 Half of the room was supposed to be guitarists who pitied me. 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 They encouraged me: 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.460
 "Yeah! Go ahead, say it. " 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 And I completely let go. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.140
 It was a great revealing moment ... I still do not know if Lonnie had calculated it or not.
