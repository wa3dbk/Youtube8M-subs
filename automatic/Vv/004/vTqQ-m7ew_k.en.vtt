00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.240
 I show him the following video tutorial 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.640
 in short how to deal with the dropbox a lot 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.469
 can create fast online gallery 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.549
 I have the standard here 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:14.950
 open pictures folder of windows 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:20.260
 with the right mouse button the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.790
 dropbox see here in the dropbox is there 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.830
 in particular folder that calls itself 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.520
 photos that sets the dropbox before 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.320
 on 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.090
 I 'll get it there already 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.590
 example album in it but we put mine 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 new folder on right mouse button 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.490
 call the super creative example album 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.050
 you see the blue of the symbols for a moment 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.000
 just synchronized the folder and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.620
 online also created in the online 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.650
 dropbox on the server, so to speak 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.040
 I put it in the click 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.200
 folder of course still empty and 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 just push the pictures over 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.579
 the folder that will be created one sees 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.720
 here too 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.649
 while slowly they are all green 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.750
 that was the pictures now 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.550
 all already uploaded now 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.790
 of course I want to watch online like 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.770
 looks now without gallery to go 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.780
 I'll go back with a flat back 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.190
 the right mouse button on the example 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.729
 album on the folder we just 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.799
 you have created the menu item dropbox 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.360
 and go to release link 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.650
 this generates a link that makes me 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.619
 I always do it too soon 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.600
 in the browser on generated me a link 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.119
 to this gallery which is newly created 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.950
 has been here is already the same 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.470
 a window on if I have one 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.049
 would like to choose anywhere right here so 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.150
 my, to whom I show something 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.799
 would like to sample applications would be 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.350
 example pictures from the last one 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.030
 company trip or photos from 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.220
 photographers who are now completely new 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.720
 I have been to customers 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 want to send or the customer wants 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
 want to send agency or as well 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.740
 always and could be right here about now 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.360
 the link Send I'm doing 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 not now but I just say 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.530
 copy link to this page copy 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 means is in the clipboard like 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.889
 the mediation is already displayed 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.840
 means I can insert by 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.069
 the link in another place again 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 use 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.620
 that's how the gallery looks like mine 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.239
 looks at the award of the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.489
 Pay attention to album titles a bit 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.959
 that this is a meaningful name because 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.659
 that is also above the gallery 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.400
 over it and the gallery works then 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.810
 also in the form that I just picture 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.310
 Click and then it will be big and me 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.519
 Of course , it's easy to do this before and 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.409
 click back 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.359
 You can also do that as original 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.030
 show that means he shows that 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.560
 image very big in the browser 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.480
 or as original also under 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.489
 That means what I have here online 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.260
 they are a bit small 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.209
 Pictures with it the gallery also fast 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.889
 works but if now for 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.349
 for example, someone from the company excursion 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.790
 in the picture he wants to download 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.139
 which can then print or 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.909
 Whatever you can do 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.290
 just use the download function that 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.750
 load on your own hard disk so 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.069
 speak the one whom I the these 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.290
 gallery ling he sends can also 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.730
 These uploaded by me and original 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 to grasp and not only to this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.010
 online gallery I'll do it again 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.469
 for now I have this link still in 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.870
 the clipboard go to my mail 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.479
 program in the case i use now 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.889
 this time google mail 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.500
 there is not much right now 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.829
 in it, actually nothing at all 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:34.659
 is just new e-mail and sends that 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:37.810
 sometimes quite Nazi to me because 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.790
 first photos super creative and use 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.169
 the right mouse button around that down here 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.750
 Of course, one could also add one 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.790
 use tax and v around the link 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.540
 insert and that is the link to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.489
 album 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.379
 if i send this link now 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.939
 can my opposite 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.979
 via the link just the online gallery 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.239
 call and look at the pictures 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.939
 and then agree with me more closely 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.310
 that 's just perfect, yes, yes 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.229
 that was the application of the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.739
 dropbox with this picture gallery of the gag 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:08.709
 I can also use video files 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 and the upload and also mp3 files 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.469
 or any other audio format I am myself 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.879
 not sure which file formats 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.599
 I will be supported 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.840
 maybe in another article 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.329
 but again show the standard 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.400
 file types what you know mp3 for 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.610
 music jpeg jpg 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.350
 gif tiff and so on will be there 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.880
 By default, that means that supports 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.139
 most of the material on the picture 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.090
 own plate is also here then 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.740
 designed in the gallery in the gallery 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.070
 Thank you for the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.070
 attention
