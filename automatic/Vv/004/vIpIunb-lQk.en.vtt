00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
easy would it be to set up first I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.640 
easy would it be to set up first I
tackle<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.970> xbox<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.990> great<00:01:33.170> thing<00:01:33.200> here

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650

is<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.250> body<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.610> your<00:01:34.790> controller<00:01:35.500> but

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
is that your body is your controller but

is that your body is your controller but
i<00:01:36.800> had<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.190> calibrate<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.880> with<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.330> center

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
i had to calibrate it with the center

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.320 
i had to calibrate it with the center
and<00:01:39.500> already<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:39.979> could<00:01:40.220> see<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:40.580> space<00:01:40.940> could

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
and already I could see that space could

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.620 
and already I could see that space could
be<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.479> problem<00:01:41.720> with<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.170> Kinect<00:01:46.030> big<00:01:47.030> fun<00:01:47.210> I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
even got Mike to measure the distance

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.000 
even got Mike to measure the distance
from<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.150> screen<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:51.110> where<00:01:51.260> we<00:01:51.409> had<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.710> stand

and<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.570> began<00:02:11.840> testing<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.470> xbox<00:02:12.950> hardware

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and I began testing the xbox hardware

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.300 
and I began testing the xbox hardware
using<00:02:13.850> our<00:02:13.940> first<00:02:14.269> game<00:02:14.570> Kinect<00:02:15.080> Sports<00:02:15.320> ray

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
using our first game Kinect Sports ray

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.310 
using our first game Kinect Sports ray
shot<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.209> entirely<00:02:17.660> different<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.110> playing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
shot it's entirely different to playing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.960 
shot it's entirely different to playing
with<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.500> controller<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.340> totally

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
with a controller that is a totally

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.680 
with a controller that is a totally
different<00:02:20.360> name<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.930> controller<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.920> is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
different name of the controller this is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.920 
different name of the controller this is
much<00:02:23.690> more<00:02:23.720> akin<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> being<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:26.209> sportsman<00:02:26.720> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
much more akin to being a sportsman is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.440 
much more akin to being a sportsman is
it<00:02:27.350> very<00:02:27.500> responsive<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.310> really<00:02:29.000> title<00:02:29.360> is

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
it very responsive is it really title is

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
this slightly layer but you don't know

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.979 
this slightly layer but you don't know
what<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.220> does<00:02:31.400> seem<00:02:31.640> very<00:02:31.970> tired<00:02:32.299> i<00:02:32.570> connect

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
what it does seem very tired i connect

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140

champions<00:03:56.569> what<00:03:57.569> I'm<00:03:57.660> noticing<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
champions what I'm noticing is the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.410 
champions what I'm noticing is the
control<00:03:59.069> method<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.489> harder<00:03:59.819> because<00:04:00.180> you

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
control method is harder because you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.440 
control method is harder because you
have<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:00.959> button<00:04:01.260> presses<00:04:01.819> combined<00:04:02.819> with

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
hitting the ball well as on a connect

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.500 
hitting the ball well as on a connect
you<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:05.700> hate<00:04:05.819> there's<00:04:06.180> nothing<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:06.480> your

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
you just hate there's nothing in your
