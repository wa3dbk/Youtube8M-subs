that I'm going to share with you are all

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.120 
that I'm going to share with you are all
about<00:00:23.750> footwork<00:00:25.869> it's<00:00:26.869> important<00:00:27.500> to<00:00:27.800> be<00:00:27.980> able

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
about footwork it's important to be able

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.480 
about footwork it's important to be able
to<00:00:28.430> get<00:00:28.730> to<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.300> smash<00:00:29.600> and<00:00:29.900> setup<00:00:30.770> most

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
to get to the smash and setup most

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.020 
to get to the smash and setup most
effectively<00:00:32.360> if<00:00:32.720> you<00:00:33.260> want<00:00:33.559> your<00:00:34.100> shot<00:00:34.400> to<00:00:34.879> be

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
effectively if you want your shot to be

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.220 
effectively if you want your shot to be
both<00:00:35.210> powerful<00:00:35.720> and<00:00:35.960> accurate<00:00:37.840> so<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.960> first

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
both powerful and accurate so the first

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.130 
both powerful and accurate so the first
thing<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:40.040> know<00:00:40.220> about<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:41.120> footwork<00:00:41.390> towards

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
thing to know about the footwork towards

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.549 
thing to know about the footwork towards
the<00:00:42.800> power<00:00:43.070> smash<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.790> what<00:00:44.540> I<00:00:44.570> call<00:00:45.019> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
the power smash is what I call the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.670 
the power smash is what I call the
spider<00:00:46.040> push<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.809> spider<00:00:48.140> push<00:00:48.470> is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
spider push and the spider push is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.189 
spider push and the spider push is
because<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.250> personally<00:00:49.909> am<00:00:50.300> NOT<00:00:50.659> a<00:00:50.690> big<00:00:50.900> fan<00:00:51.170> of

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
because I personally am NOT a big fan of

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.430 
because I personally am NOT a big fan of
spiders<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.610> while<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.269> was<00:00:53.479> coaching<00:00:53.750> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
spiders so while I was coaching the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.320 
spiders so while I was coaching the
little<00:00:54.739> ones<00:00:54.949> I<00:00:55.250> came<00:00:55.640> up<00:00:55.820> with<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.089> idea

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
little ones I came up with this idea

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.700 
little ones I came up with this idea
that<00:00:56.870> if<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.470> imagine<00:00:57.850> there's<00:00:58.850> giant

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
that if you imagine there's giant

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.369 
that if you imagine there's giant
tarantulas<00:01:00.710> under<00:01:01.370> your<00:01:01.760> feet<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.510> when<00:01:03.260> you

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
tarantulas under your feet and when you

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.890 
tarantulas under your feet and when you
move<00:01:03.559> back<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:04.309> hit<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.489> power<00:01:04.790> smash<00:01:05.210> you

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
move back to hit the power smash you

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.440 
move back to hit the power smash you
have<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.380> squash<00:01:06.860> those<00:01:07.310> tarantulas<00:01:08.060> under

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
have to squash those tarantulas under

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.480 
have to squash those tarantulas under
your<00:01:08.600> feet<00:01:08.780> or<00:01:09.049> else<00:01:09.500> they're<00:01:09.950> gonna<00:01:10.040> climb<00:01:10.430> up

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
your feet or else they're gonna climb up

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.280 
your feet or else they're gonna climb up
and<00:01:10.820> bite<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:12.909> what<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.119> does<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.750> found

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
and bite you and what that does I found

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.709 
and bite you and what that does I found
is<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.799> it<00:01:15.920> gets<00:01:16.190> people<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.030> do<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.299> very

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
is that it gets people to do a very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.190 
is that it gets people to do a very
strong<00:01:18.439> push<00:01:19.009> off<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.729> ground<00:01:20.020> towards<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
strong push off the ground towards the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.910 
strong push off the ground towards the
shot<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:22.640> initial<00:01:23.390> push<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:24.079> key

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
shot and that initial push is key

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.429 
shot and that initial push is key
because<00:01:25.549> that's<00:01:25.880> what<00:01:26.210> generates<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.259> energy

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
because that's what generates the energy

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.940 
because that's what generates the energy
that<00:01:28.189> you're<00:01:28.399> gonna<00:01:28.549> transfer<00:01:29.000> up<00:01:29.630> into<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
that you're gonna transfer up into the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.209 
that you're gonna transfer up into the
shot<00:01:31.479> so<00:01:32.479> that's<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.840> first<00:01:33.109> secret<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.979> get

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
shot so that's the first secret to get

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.230 
shot so that's the first secret to get
the<00:01:34.549> power<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.920> that's<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.280> first<00:01:37.490> secret<00:01:37.820> to

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the power so that's the first secret to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.709 
the power so that's the first secret to
get<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.689> strong<00:01:39.469> spider<00:01:40.250> push<00:01:40.640> that's<00:01:41.179> going<00:01:41.600> to

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
get a strong spider push that's going to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.499 
get a strong spider push that's going to
squash<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.619> spiders<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
squash the spiders and get you on the

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.620 
squash the spiders and get you on the
move<00:01:44.689> towards<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.799> backcourt<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:47.270> be<00:01:47.509> aware

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
move towards the backcourt now be aware

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.289 
move towards the backcourt now be aware
that<00:01:47.899> when<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.530> squash<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.249> spiders<00:01:49.729> we

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
that when you squash the spiders we

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.989 
that when you squash the spiders we
don't<00:01:50.600> want<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.990> jump<00:01:51.229> upwards<00:01:51.920> after<00:01:52.850> we

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
don't want to jump upwards after we

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.319 
don't want to jump upwards after we
squash<00:01:53.390> them<00:01:53.689> we<00:01:54.049> want<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.350> push<00:01:54.649> back<00:01:55.329> towards

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
squash them we want to push back towards

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.419 
squash them we want to push back towards
the<00:01:56.630> baseline<00:01:57.049> because<00:01:57.649> that's<00:01:58.039> where<00:01:58.310> we're

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
the baseline because that's where we're

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.440 
the baseline because that's where we're
going<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.640> need<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.969> set<00:01:59.240> up<00:01:59.499> before<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:00.530> smash

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
going to need to set up before the smash

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.239 
going to need to set up before the smash
now<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.509> second<00:02:03.079> secret<00:02:03.409> I'm<00:02:03.679> gonna<00:02:04.009> share

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
now the second secret I'm gonna share

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.290 
now the second secret I'm gonna share
with<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.460> has<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.329> do<00:02:05.539> with<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:06.380> one-legged

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
with you has to do with the one-legged

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.160 
with you has to do with the one-legged
jump<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.830> lot<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.950> people<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.850> use<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.930> one

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
jump a lot of people like to use the one

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.160 
jump a lot of people like to use the one
leg<00:02:12.440> jump<00:02:12.830> when<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.100> comes<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.640> smash

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
leg jump when it comes to the smash

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.590 
leg jump when it comes to the smash
because<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.950> two-legged<00:02:16.580> jump<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.480> a

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
because the two-legged jump is just a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
because the two-legged jump is just a
little<00:02:18.020> too<00:02:18.290> advanced<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.250> physically

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
little too advanced and physically

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940 
little too advanced and physically
difficult<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:20.989> still<00:02:21.349> want<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.709> be<00:02:21.830> able

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
difficult but they still want to be able

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.280 
difficult but they still want to be able
to<00:02:22.129> get<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.489> little<00:02:22.879> bit<00:02:23.030> higher<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.170> they

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
to get a little bit higher up so they

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.900 
to get a little bit higher up so they
can<00:02:24.500> get<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.709> steeper<00:02:25.250> shot

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
can get a steeper shot

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.930 
can get a steeper shot
so<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.570> key<00:02:27.230> component<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.430> one-legged

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
so the key component of the one-legged

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.720 
so the key component of the one-legged
jump<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.630> being<00:02:30.290> able<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.830> transfer<00:02:31.700> your
