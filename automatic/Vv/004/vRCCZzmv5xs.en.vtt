00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the doctor is with us this morning 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.370
 Luis left medical director of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.109
 ophthalmology for being with us is 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 tomorrow we will talk about a 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.580
 innovation 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.869
 technological marvel that will help 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.079
 all the people that have to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 operate for different diseases in 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.660
 the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.660
 thank you for being with us thanks 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.079
 is a team called ink the law is a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.030
 technology through laser 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.629
 very fast femtosecond that creates a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 plasma that is to say it is replacing little to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.320
 little already the scalpel that we can be 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.809
 using us 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
 like any other surgeon and everything 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.390
 done through which all that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.650
 scared by the scalpels type I know 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.150
 that the one who fears that they cut him thus be 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.120
 them to the eyes so be it under a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.309
 synesthesia with this one for everyone 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
 it will no longer be necessary to have to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.600
 use these clamps the clear and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 then many times including us 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 themselves the doctors of the first fear 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 is the injections of the truth faith and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 more to the cuts then this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.110
 technology allows us at this time 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.560
 to be able to do it without need 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.290
 be for cases of myopia and so on 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.410
 reality we do we use for myopia 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.180
 astigmatism and hyperopia for 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.580
 patient problems that can not see from 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.400
 close is given start to move away 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.460
 role of presbyopia and we use it 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.130
 even for surgeries as a transplant 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.870
 of cornea or for surgeries for patients 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.430
 as alterations of the cornea called 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.680
 keratoconus 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.380
 an example a surgery that took us 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.740
 before maybe half an hour in these 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 We are doing moments in 78 seconds 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 then it is very fast and above all 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.470
 very sure that perhaps the fundamental thing of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.479
 hold on do not lose it gross we're going to 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.649
 have images also of how it is that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.870
 applies that new technology that goes to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.940
 allow undoubtedly many people 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.120
 operations can be done in a 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.750
 much faster also if you tell them 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.580
 that surgery now to perform it 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.470
 with this system between laws can 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.960
 delay us an average between 28 thirty 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.080
 seconds nothing more 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.290
 nor the anesthesia with drops is to say no 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.420
 there is no moment no needle or cuts the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.390
 average recovery time in these 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.170
 Mine moments are between 8 to 12 hours 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.140
 complete only for vision 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.180
 but whole 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 the only fear beyond the scalpels 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.220
 and other things feel of the costs 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
 on issues like then that also the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.040
 technology that goes to the beginning always 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.069
 It can be more expensive 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.260
 but with time it becomes cheaper we are not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.170
 right now I think we have 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 access because in this system 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.370
 called while laws also exists in 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.250
 other countries we have placed it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.050
 already more than a year ago 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.520
 but every time we see more patients 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.520
 prefer by the very fact of the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.440
 security does not come to be much more 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.210
 costly than the old technology that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.020
 flame of the sic 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.120
 and how much time then is extremely 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.700
 ambulatory treatment and in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.700
 actually more delay the consultation 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.440
 previous what most delay comes until the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.220
 previous exams on aileron if you can by 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.040
 Surgery is approximately between 30 to 40 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.590
 seconds by technology only 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.390
 have you at this moment is called 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.300
 what do I say about this company that 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.180
 exhaust cement laws we have it 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.340
 but the most interesting thing is that what 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.260
 we are doing making new 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.150
 procedures that could not be performed 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.460
 now that we do with these with the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.740
 ternas more and then the one of the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.230
 application of the intervention what time 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.590
 it has to happen for this person 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.720
 which remains subject to surgery for longer 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.120
 can normally see the simple we say 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.640
 that will perform the operation by 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.110
 example today the next day we see it in 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.690
 the morning and they start with their 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.600
 activities what we avoid is water from 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.150
 Sea or pool for about 5 days 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.260
 and avoid raising your eyes but 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.849
 begin the activities of the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.709
 computer 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.539
 all you have to do reading 

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:34.399
 we have no problems with that day 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.580
 next the operation and always 

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:39.639
 use the dark glasses yes on 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.639
 everything for the sun and 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.909
 many people thought that in summer no 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.229
 It is convenient to operate or not in reality in 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.370
 summer a lot more people are operating 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.110
 because he has a little more time 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.190
 of the book leaves work earlier 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.930
 on Fridays 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.470
 and thanks for letting us know this 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.780
 novelty that certainly still look 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.210
 explaining the usual intervention 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.500
 traditional with cuts 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.819
 until this innovation goes 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.740
 extending see how everything 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.360
 procedure actually whenever you are going 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.090
 to incentivize more each time it will grow 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.060
 more currently in europe and usa the 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.620
 election procedure is this 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.419
 thank you very much for your visit tomorrow 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.800
 with us now let's know this 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.729
 novelty that will undoubtedly benefit 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.639
 those that as I said then we have 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.059
 those cuts do not differentiate between one and 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.099
 another saying in each time what is a 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.680
 approximate difference which is only 30 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.169
 seconds or the time difference 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.509
 maybe not the most important thing if it's not the 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.099
 security since with this we decrease 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.809
 greatly the complications that 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.669
 can exist with previous system not 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.080
 made an application that facilitates 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.710
 you also work nothing for 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.719
 course because by eliminating us 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.550
 increased risk of complications 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.469
 I have much happier patients 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.139
 we have ourselves we are very much 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.719
 quieter in the same time of 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.399
 operation also already adding with the 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.129
 maps always be much better things from 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:10.469
 the technology many left 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.750
 ophthalmologist director we are going to 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.470
 Make a pause 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.470
 to
