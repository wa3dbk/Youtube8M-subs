00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.840
 route ag2r the world 15th stage of this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 Tour de France 2013 between Givors and the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.680
 Mont Ventoux in the inside of the day 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 followed the relatives of the runners 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.119
 start of this 15th stage 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.550
 the debriefing will be with julien jurdie 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 and then the topic did you know this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.820
 times with the quadrille and samuel 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.460
 Dumoulin who explained to us 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.760
 the expression take the gruppetto it's 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.760
 left 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.530
 what to do then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 baptist 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.010
 2 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.370
 learn 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.930
 we came to see dad to encourage him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.580
 make departure today I think that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.020
 everyone is happy to mom the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.700
 little chicchi and cheers dad 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 usually on TV and he feels very 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.020
 happy to see him in real life and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 then hubert is happy with us 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.479
 see 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940
 it is good of his cut at best the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 race and then that's always nice 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.820
 to be towards the house also what there 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 it's true that three and a half weeks 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.300
 absence in total is long for the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.009
 kids especially end me I have a little 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 the usual now 15th big round 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.420
 so here it is my arrival then on the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.009
 turn it's always so special it's 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 in italy are hard too this year 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 but this is really something else is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.970
 sure the tour de france so and all the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.460
 show that will also cost for 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 children like it too 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.950
 I think it's especially important 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.590
 for jean-christophe he still 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 many need to see his family 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.570
 children to feel surrounded then after 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.569
 obviously for kids four 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 weeks is long so without their dad 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.660
 get involved for the moment they do not have 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.140
 necessarily the notion of the length of the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.520
 time so sometimes he may be absent 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.340
 two days and it seems very long 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.289
 three weeks much less so that's 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.649
 fluctuating claims me we have time to get 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.549
 see a half an hour in the morning 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.050
 possibly eating together the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.300
 evening if the state has not been too much 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.819
 complicated and if the next day step is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 not too hard either so he can 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.989
 recover 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 So we get to see is pretty much a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.500
 hour in the day 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.930
 we had the unpleasant surprise of 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.540
 see a eurocare team a little bit 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.840
 will say sneaky and we will not say 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.700
 necessarily good players to what it is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.470
 clear that you have to accept to lose it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.180
 had lost the race escaped 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.260
 had been at the end and risks 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.340
 escape the end but there was 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.760
 also risks the breakaway only 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.990
 not at the end 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.430
 me it is true that we are a little bit a 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.210
 little bit disappointed with the behavior when 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.560
 even of europcar to roll we will say 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.480
 for long kilometers in 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.860
 going down the quarters knowing that they 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
 had nothing to gain afterwards on 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.580
 this step then this is a small 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.260
 not very frustrating to see a team 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.140
 french rolled on his breakaway like 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 this one good they go they go I think 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 surely it was their game them 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.580
 but hey it's true it was a little bit 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.020
 of frustration compared to that after we 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.610
 made a nice even last rise 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.260
 with a very good Christophe jeans 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.610
 PÃ©raud who was able to hang on to the group 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.170
 the best for a long time has 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.800
 stalled a little bit on the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.780
 last part 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.360
 but hey a very beautiful climb of 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.670
 our leader who stabilizes his 9th place 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.610
 in the overall standings and who are nibbling 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.160
 a little bit about the competitors of 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.320
 behind is also a good good shot ah 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.460
 grouped of our climbers compared to 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.950
 team ranking we saw one 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360
 also a very good Roman bardet already 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.100
 actor on the start then who really 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.620
 we make a nice comeback that ends 19th 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.100
 and also a john dalli john gadret 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.600
 22nd who seems to have had a little bit 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.160
 less well in the first 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.110
 kilometers of ventoux but after that 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.310
 well ressaisi did the last ten 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.890
 kilometers really like it takes to 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.620
 resume a beautiful 22nd place and especially 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.750
 offer us the podium of the ranking by 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.270
 3rd team right now behind 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.060
 sax and belkin in fact it's the group 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.580
 which is not necessarily the last 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.020
 ascent but at a time when 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.340
 runners they know that here they 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.980
 can afford to regroup 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.720
 go up quietly that will allow them 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.730
 to arrive on time sometimes there is 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.620
 some steps where it's more complicated 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.750
 where there is no you do to he 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.840
 is forming quickly because I was holding 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.250
 no and not the slightest voice 50th sticks to 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.140
 start all that there is no puff rate 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.340
 which is tightening is a little bit each for 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.130
 after 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.889
 it shows more in the final kind to 60 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.169
 km the arrival to say to pass a pass 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.550
 there and then that it ends up difficult you 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.560
 even it's a collar often has it maybe 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.240
 that's where it's formulated 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.729
 gruppetto it's really the last 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.770
 group what is in front of the car 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.570
 broom that closes the race and that is 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.979
 just in time usually those 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.389
 who are released from the gruppetto it's 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.639
 that they are a jump to the sick or woman 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.680
 we do not fit it usually has to 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.699
 it's home one evening my part 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.669
 if he can not talk to himself too much 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.710
 usually a gruppetto in a little bit 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.780
 distress after there is everything in a group 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.570
 is bullish and guys who manages to a 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.979
 crossing in turn no 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.410
 a lot of me keep it a gruppetto 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.090
 nevertheless it is still we 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.280
 find but we exchange looks or 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.560
 bottom it's not giving us a can 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.820
 age but it's for anyway 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.820
 rather difficult moments
