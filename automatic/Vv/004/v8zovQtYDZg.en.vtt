00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
of the walking dead this works because

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.060 
of the walking dead this works because
during<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.869> death<00:01:22.050> animation<00:01:22.380> you're

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
during the death animation you're

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
during the death animation you're
already<00:01:23.430> classes<00:01:24.000> being<00:01:24.240> dead<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.930> cannot

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
already classes being dead so you cannot

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.910 
already classes being dead so you cannot
be<00:01:25.350> attacked

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
be attacked

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
be attacked
well<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.759> dropping<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> ground<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well you're dropping to the ground and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.540 
well you're dropping to the ground and
that<00:01:27.869> death<00:01:28.110> animation<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.800> by<00:01:28.920> breaking<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that death animation so by breaking that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.670 
that death animation so by breaking that
stall<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.600> retain<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.080> effect<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
stall you would retain the effect of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.639 
stall you would retain the effect of
being<00:01:31.890> dead<00:01:32.220> thus<00:01:32.910> making<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.509> inner<00:01:34.170> tackle

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
being dead thus making your inner tackle

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.940 
being dead thus making your inner tackle
and<00:01:34.830> essentially<00:01:35.250> invincible<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> game<00:01:36.950> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and essentially invincible in game so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.529 
and essentially invincible in game so
while<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> zero<00:01:38.520> hit<00:01:38.759> points<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.360> bug

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
while you're a zero hit points the bug

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:40.999 
while you're a zero hit points the bug
was<00:01:39.690> completely<00:01:40.140> setup<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was completely setup and it was

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
was completely setup and it was
completely<00:01:41.430> permanent<00:01:42.000> until<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.390> logged

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
completely permanent until you logged

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
completely permanent until you logged
out<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.350> character<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> essentially<00:01:44.460> dead

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
out your character is essentially dead

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
out your character is essentially dead
meaning<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> can't<00:01:45.600> teleport<00:01:45.990> anywhere<00:01:46.380> but

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
meaning you can't teleport anywhere but

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.890 
meaning you can't teleport anywhere but
everything<00:01:47.760> else<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.090> fully<00:01:48.299> functional<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
everything else is fully functional so

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.719 
everything else is fully functional so
you<00:01:49.110> could<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.350> trade<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> even<00:01:50.610> go

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you could even trade and even go

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
you could even trade and even go
