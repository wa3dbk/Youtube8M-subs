the difficulty with port forwarding and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.710 
the difficulty with port forwarding and
here's<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.040> general<00:00:51.280> idea<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.269> is<00:00:52.390> that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
here's the general idea of it is that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.329 
here's the general idea of it is that
you<00:00:53.320> go<00:00:53.440> into<00:00:53.559> your<00:00:53.769> router<00:00:53.979> you<00:00:54.879> choose<00:00:55.300> the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
you go into your router you choose the

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.000 
you go into your router you choose the
minecraft<00:00:57.339> port<00:00:57.850> which<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:59.559> your<00:00:59.800> IP

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
minecraft port which is not your IP

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.790 
minecraft port which is not your IP
address<00:01:00.280> but<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.150> secondary<00:01:01.809> port<00:01:02.229> number<00:01:02.620> and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
address but a secondary port number and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.730 
address but a secondary port number and
then<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.460> forward<00:01:04.299> that<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.900> computer

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
then you forward that to the computer

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.160 
then you forward that to the computer
that<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.520> hosting<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.390> minecraft<00:01:07.930> server

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
that is hosting the minecraft server

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.830 
that is hosting the minecraft server
that<00:01:08.770> you're<00:01:08.890> running<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.210> difficulty

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
that you're running and the difficulty

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.539 
that you're running and the difficulty
is<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.530> need<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.740> do<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.310> your

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
is that you need to do that in your

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.670 
is that you need to do that in your
router<00:01:12.760> normally<00:01:13.540> you'll<00:01:13.690> have<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> router<00:01:14.290> and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
router normally you'll have a router and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.950 
router normally you'll have a router and
a<00:01:14.799> modem<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.610> can<00:01:15.820> get<00:01:15.970> difficult<00:01:16.180> make<00:01:16.810> sure

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
a modem this can get difficult make sure

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.690 
a modem this can get difficult make sure
that<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.320> are<00:01:17.439> changing<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.009> on<00:01:18.250> your

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
that you are changing this on your

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.840 
that you are changing this on your
router<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.360> then<00:01:20.079> some<00:01:20.710> modems<00:01:21.189> have<00:01:21.520> routers

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
router and then some modems have routers

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.850 
router and then some modems have routers
built<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.329> so<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.689> also<00:01:22.960> have<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.469> do<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.740> on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
built in so you also have to do it on

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.700 
built in so you also have to do it on
the<00:01:24.310> modem<00:01:24.579> as<00:01:24.909> well<00:01:25.479> all<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.380> this<00:01:26.469> can<00:01:26.680> be

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
the modem as well all of this can be

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.679 
the modem as well all of this can be
made<00:01:27.009> even<00:01:27.399> more<00:01:27.430> difficult<00:01:27.700> by<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.539> fact

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
made even more difficult by the fact

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.569 
made even more difficult by the fact
that<00:01:28.960> there<00:01:29.170> are<00:01:29.320> tons<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:29.979> tons<00:01:30.070> of

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
that there are tons and tons of

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.490 
that there are tons and tons of
different<00:01:30.759> brands<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.570> some<00:01:31.869> brands<00:01:32.170> of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
different brands and some brands of

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.740 
different brands and some brands of
routers<00:01:33.280> called<00:01:33.909> things<00:01:34.149> different<00:01:34.689> things

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
routers called things different things

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.109 
routers called things different things
and<00:01:35.469> so<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.859> can<00:01:36.039> get<00:01:36.159> really<00:01:36.460> confusing

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and so it can get really confusing

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.840 
and so it can get really confusing
really<00:01:37.719> fast<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.680> suggestion<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.579> would

around<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> do<00:03:47.890> need<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.310> set<00:03:48.520> up<00:03:48.700> some

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
around it you do need to set up some

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.200 
around it you do need to set up some
sort<00:03:49.210> of<00:03:49.330> server<00:03:49.800> for<00:03:50.800> people<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.640> host<00:03:51.880> that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
sort of server for people to host that

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.900 
sort of server for people to host that
so<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.630> lots<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.050> people<00:03:53.110> can<00:03:53.550> connect<00:03:54.550> to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
so that lots of people can connect to

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.970 
so that lots of people can connect to
your<00:03:55.300> game<00:03:55.630> but<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:55.990> is<00:03:56.050> simple<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.830> don't

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
your game but this is simple you don't

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.370 
your game but this is simple you don't
have<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.220> setup<00:03:57.460> anything<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.420> if<00:03:59.020> you're<00:03:59.170> all

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
have to setup anything and if you're all

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.690 
have to setup anything and if you're all
at<00:03:59.620> home<00:03:59.800> like<00:04:00.070> if<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.250> want<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.490> just<00:04:00.580> play

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
at home like if you want to just play

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.310 
at home like if you want to just play
with<00:04:00.880> your<00:04:01.030> brother<00:04:01.330> who's<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> same<00:04:02.110> room

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320

with you
this<00:04:03.040> works<00:04:03.490> very<00:04:03.700> well<00:04:04.090> make<00:04:04.870> sure<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.200> are

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
this works very well make sure you are

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.960 
this works very well make sure you are
connected<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.890> some<00:04:06.130> sort<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.400> network<00:04:06.730> you

connected to some sort of network you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.040 
connected to some sort of network you
know<00:04:07.330> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.870> will<00:04:08.170> work<00:04:08.800> just<00:04:08.830> fine<00:04:09.250> okay<00:04:10.050> now

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050

onto<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.560> next<00:04:11.590> question<00:04:11.950> what<00:04:12.670> is<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.150> best

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
onto the next question what is the best

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.920 
onto the next question what is the best
food<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.440> eat<00:04:14.970> sometimes<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.150> eat<00:04:16.359> things<00:04:16.660> and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
food to eat sometimes I eat things and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.810 
food to eat sometimes I eat things and
my<00:04:16.989> hunger<00:04:17.140> goes<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.680> really<00:04:17.980> fast<00:04:18.340> and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
my hunger goes down really fast and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.630 
my hunger goes down really fast and
sometimes<00:04:19.480> it<00:04:19.780> takes<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.200> long<00:04:20.590> time<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:21.370> is

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
sometimes it takes a long time this is

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.990 
sometimes it takes a long time this is
from<00:04:21.940> Josh<00:04:22.270> C<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:24.010> true<00:04:24.520> sometimes

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
from Josh C and it's true sometimes

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.300 
from Josh C and it's true sometimes
you'll<00:04:25.420> eat<00:04:25.630> one<00:04:25.930> thing<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.620> let's<00:04:27.040> say<00:04:27.280> a

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
you'll eat one thing like let's say a

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.880 
you'll eat one thing like let's say a
melon<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.000> your<00:04:28.840> hunger<00:04:29.170> will<00:04:29.350> start<00:04:29.620> going

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
melon and your hunger will start going

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.800 
melon and your hunger will start going
down<00:04:30.070> pretty<00:04:30.610> quickly<00:04:30.850> after<00:04:31.390> you've<00:04:31.540> eaten

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
down pretty quickly after you've eaten

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.630 
down pretty quickly after you've eaten
it<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:32.860> other<00:04:33.040> times<00:04:33.370> you'll<00:04:33.550> eat

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
it and then other times you'll eat

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.430 
it and then other times you'll eat
something<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.150> pork<00:04:34.480> chop<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.290> will

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
something like a pork chop and it will

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.190 
something like a pork chop and it will
stay<00:04:35.800> you'll<00:04:36.550> stay<00:04:36.610> full<00:04:37.060> for<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.450> very<00:04:37.870> long

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
stay you'll stay full for a very long

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.870 
stay you'll stay full for a very long
amount<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.620> time<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:39.490> because

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
amount of time and that's because

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.770 
amount of time and that's because
there's<00:04:40.120> actually

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
there's actually

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.590 
there's actually
two<00:04:41.139> types<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:42.010> hunger<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.790> game<00:04:43.030> one

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
two types of hunger in the game one

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.540 
two types of hunger in the game one
that's<00:04:43.840> visible<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:44.889> see<00:04:45.070> right<00:04:45.310> on

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
that's visible that you can see right on

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's visible that you can see right on
your<00:04:45.670> HUD<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.180> one<00:04:46.600> that's<00:04:46.840> invisible<00:04:47.380> the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
your HUD and one that's invisible the

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.580 
your HUD and one that's invisible the
invisible<00:04:48.610> one<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:49.030> called

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
invisible one is called

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.580 
invisible one is called
saturation<00:04:50.590> saturation<00:04:51.280> is<00:04:52.240> sort<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.110> like<00:04:53.320> a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
saturation saturation is sort of like a

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.150 
saturation saturation is sort of like a
past<00:04:54.340> full<00:04:54.940> meter<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:56.080> have<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.530> extra

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
past full meter you have this extra

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760 
past full meter you have this extra
saturation<00:04:57.820> level<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.630> once<00:04:59.139> decreased

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
saturation level that once decreased

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.460 
saturation level that once decreased
will<00:05:00.250> then<00:05:00.490> start<00:05:00.940> taking<00:05:01.180> away<00:05:01.780> from<00:05:01.840> your

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
will then start taking away from your

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.030 
will then start taking away from your
actual<00:05:02.950> hunger<00:05:03.460> bar<00:05:03.669> which<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.540> can<00:05:05.050> see<00:05:05.410> you

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
actual hunger bar which you can see you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.940 
actual hunger bar which you can see you
can<00:05:06.220> have<00:05:06.460> up<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.389> same<00:05:07.600> amount<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:08.230> hunger

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
can have up to the same amount of hunger

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.150 
can have up to the same amount of hunger
that<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.460> have<00:05:09.810> normally<00:05:10.810> that's<00:05:10.930> around<00:05:11.230> 20

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
that you have normally that's around 20

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.190 
that you have normally that's around 20
points<00:05:12.639> but<00:05:12.820> let's<00:05:13.030> say<00:05:13.240> your<00:05:13.660> hunger<00:05:13.990> has

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
points but let's say your hunger has

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.400 
points but let's say your hunger has
gone<00:05:14.440> down<00:05:14.800> let's<00:05:15.760> say<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:15.970> only<00:05:16.450> 5<00:05:16.780> haunches

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
gone down let's say to only 5 haunches

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.980 
gone down let's say to only 5 haunches
that<00:05:17.919> set<00:05:18.190> 10<00:05:18.520> points<00:05:19.060> that<00:05:19.510> means<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:19.870> your

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
that set 10 points that means that your

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.930 
that set 10 points that means that your
saturation<00:05:20.650> can<00:05:20.919> only<00:05:21.190> also<00:05:21.700> be<00:05:22.300> 10<00:05:22.840> points<00:05:23.590> of

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
saturation can only also be 10 points of

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.750 
saturation can only also be 10 points of
saturation<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.270> your<00:05:25.540> question<00:05:26.230> was<00:05:26.490> how<00:05:27.490> what

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
saturation so your question was how what

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.690 
saturation so your question was how what
is<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:27.910> best<00:05:28.390> food<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.140> eat<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.620> that's<00:05:30.340> kind

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
is the best food to eat and that's kind

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.890 
is the best food to eat and that's kind
of<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.850> complicated<00:05:31.360> question<00:05:31.510> because

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
of a complicated question because

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.260 
of a complicated question because
there's<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.140> lot<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.530> ways<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:33.220> determine<00:05:33.970> that

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
there's a lot of ways to determine that

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.050 
there's a lot of ways to determine that
if<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.229> if<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.740> want<00:05:35.979> to<00:05:36.070> be<00:05:36.160> super<00:05:36.610> opie

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
if you if you want to be super opie

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.750 
if you if you want to be super opie
probably<00:05:37.780> golden<00:05:38.380> apples<00:05:38.860> would<00:05:39.220> be<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.550> best

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
probably golden apples would be the best

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.580 
probably golden apples would be the best
food<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.060> eat<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:40.690> those<00:05:40.810> are<00:05:40.960> really<00:05:41.110> hard<00:05:41.380> to

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
food to eat but those are really hard to

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.909 
food to eat but those are really hard to
come<00:05:41.800> by<00:05:42.040> so<00:05:42.700> what<00:05:43.330> is<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.840> easiest<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.740> get

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
come by so what is the easiest to get

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.010 
come by so what is the easiest to get
with<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.640> most<00:05:46.000> amount<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.450> hunger<00:05:46.840> and

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
with the most amount of hunger and

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.870 
with the most amount of hunger and
saturation<00:05:47.680> well<00:05:48.340> that<00:05:48.490> would<00:05:48.610> be<00:05:48.640> either

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
saturation well that would be either

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.260 
saturation well that would be either
pork<00:05:49.330> chops<00:05:49.630> or<00:05:49.870> steak<00:05:50.470> those<00:05:51.280> both<00:05:51.640> will<00:05:52.060> give

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
pork chops or steak those both will give

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.469 
pork chops or steak those both will give
you<00:05:52.510> eight<00:05:52.870> points<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.790> hunger<00:05:54.790> back<00:05:55.000> so

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
you eight points of hunger back so

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.840 
you eight points of hunger back so
that's<00:05:55.660> four<00:05:56.200> haunches<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.039> your<00:05:57.280> food<00:05:57.520> scale

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
that's four haunches on your food scale

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.480 
that's four haunches on your food scale
and<00:05:59.010> 12.8<00:06:01.200> saturation<00:06:02.200> so<00:06:02.650> that<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:02.979> can<00:06:03.190> be

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
and 12.8 saturation so that you can be

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.150 
and 12.8 saturation so that you can be
fully<00:06:03.820> saturated<00:06:04.360> after<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:05.080> have<00:06:05.260> eaten<00:06:05.410> one

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
fully saturated after you have eaten one

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.670 
fully saturated after you have eaten one
