brain octane oil so that's the MCT oil

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.740 
brain octane oil so that's the MCT oil
it's<00:03:07.560> great<00:03:07.829> for<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.099> mental<00:03:08.459> clarity

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
of videos just about that helps with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.000 
of videos just about that helps with
metabolism<00:03:15.380> helps<00:03:16.380> with<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.590> lot<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.769> things

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
metabolism helps with a lot of things

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.740 
metabolism helps with a lot of things
and<00:03:17.190> what<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.459> essentially<00:03:17.940> what<00:03:18.209> happens<00:03:18.600> is

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and what it essentially what happens is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.470 
and what it essentially what happens is
the<00:03:18.900> butter<00:03:19.170> works<00:03:19.829> as<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.130> vehicle<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:21.329> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the butter works as a vehicle to get the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.740 
the butter works as a vehicle to get the
MCT<00:03:22.400> up<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.609> your<00:03:23.700> brain<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.209> helps<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.540> brain

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
MCT up to your brain it helps with brain

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.300 
MCT up to your brain it helps with brain
functions<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:25.530> gets<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:25.950> around<00:03:26.160> your

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
functions and just gets it around your

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.550 
functions and just gets it around your
body<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.329> butter<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
body so the the butter is really the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.099 
body so the the butter is really the
vehicle<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.160> what<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.269> calls<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.930> one

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
vehicle so what this calls for is one

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.559 
vehicle so what this calls for is one
