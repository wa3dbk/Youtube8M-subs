00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.790
 stop talking about this solidarity last Sunday corinthias fans 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.990
 have shown that football can also serve as an incentive to help the 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.269
 next 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.869
 I'm 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.869
 goal 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.210
 3 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.429
 ferreira 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.039
 weak 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 a wing 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.849
 the corinthian blood campaign 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.739
 starts on this Sunday 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.130
 good public presence 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.970
 in the pro-blood foundation of the clinic hospital has many people who 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.839
 they do it 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.190
 has palm twist among the furniture 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 I looked for mothers day and fathers the feat that also does a job 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.880
 cool here in Sao Paulo I said poxa 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.170
 why can not I that it's a campaign that had all the fans I'd say 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 which for each fan performed 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.140
 both the fan only listens on the radio and the home TV and this claim has 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.499
 players going on the race 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.940
 In sacrifice I stay because the contract 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 she's going to have a bit of a story about a boy she loves to have 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 everything that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.950
 regardless of the color of the shirt 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 Many people here who are not also Corinthian the Palmeirense 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.130
 Santista 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 the black bridge had many people today that the dollar think it important that all 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.830
 people even if they are not fulfilled seeing here 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 if the hypothesis of all equal in important any amount desired 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.330
 I understand the pain full of good intervention 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.070
 defeated at the last minute by the medical department 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.520
 not two 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.770
 because it will not be a problem either 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.730
 and now 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.960
 In a month 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.630
 already the door of the year I will be here again the thing that is collaborating with 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.510
 campaign has an alternative for those who can not donate the blood 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.360
 you can not donate blood for some reason because I have a beer 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.590
 by a pass by the camera closer to you 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.940
 but I ended up not buying non-perishable food now 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.460
 this Thursday the victims in ten people who were chosen I doubt 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.430
 chains 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.560
 and the hawks of the faithful that the fans are supporting us is also the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 militia who is the idealizer of the campaign who participates knows the importance of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.010
 such campaigns as the Sao Paulines - and interestingly baked this part of the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.050
 donation because without the donation there 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 no team has no color has no distinction at an important moment in 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.809
 blood that will make you four lives is 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:27.799
 each bag containing four times each 64-bit civilian bag participate 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.159
 interesting this donation hope that these twisted ones also performs beyond 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.179
 you have blood in your vein 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.109
 so he is called up to play in the team of solidarity 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 everybody has to join have to donate have a lot of people needing 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.679
 still yesterday the guy who will know if that is curintia agencies and clients 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.519
 and how it can only 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.519
 What's going on, I saw that the most important question 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.939
 Earth 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 she 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.140
 the ark 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.230
 the goal
