00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.959
 and the legacy that she sings and we get 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.119
 found on gt5 on old gen for a 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.820
 any new video location and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.790
 secret place of course these places finally this 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.980
 place also works on pc and xbox 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.540
 live and playstation 4 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.420
 so here I'm showing you now or 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.880
 and finally where is this place so that's it 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.809
 justify in this little alley you 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.589
 can go there 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.940
 rather go with your vehicle so 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.920
 if you want to hide it there is a 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.730
 small garage that automatically deafens 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.890
 in the alley 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.359
 otherwise you have other locations 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.920
 in other small enough points enough 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.179
 nice we'll say that like that because 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.589
 that you and that allow you by 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.120
 example of hiding yourself from 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.199
 players if you put for example in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 invisible mode or even to erase your 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.210
 search clues to the police 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.250
 so there are three places like sap whose 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.080
 one with a fire extinguisher so I do not know 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.980
 why is there this fire extinguisher you have 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.050
 he was the fake 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.700
 so I do not know so high if you 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.230
 already know this place but I 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.880
 really wanted to share it because 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.720
 that just above there is also a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.370
 heliport 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.260
 so it's very handy if by 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.600
 example you want to come here with your 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.570
 helicopter you were laying and you were planing 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.740
 or even drive with the famous garage 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.780
 so that's why I wanted 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.280
 really you share this little 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.350
 video by the way I thank all the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.150
 subscribers that they participated in the video 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.040
 so that was a little bit of a mess 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.250
 but that's still very scary 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.260
 pass forgiveness so thanks to all of you and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.390
