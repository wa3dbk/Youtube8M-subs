videos video for um as you see this is
the<00:00:39.000> reason<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.629> maxed<00:00:40.410> 500<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.930> reason<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the reason I maxed 500 the reason I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.479 
the reason I maxed 500 the reason I
haven't<00:00:43.739> been<00:00:43.890> making<00:00:44.070> any<00:00:44.460> razor<00:00:44.850> videos

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
haven't been making any razor videos

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
haven't been making any razor videos
anytime<00:00:47.489> soon<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.760 

watch<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.220> hit<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.120> acceleration<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
watch as I hit the acceleration the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.689 
watch as I hit the acceleration the
wheel<00:00:56.010> doesn't<00:00:56.880> move

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.469 

see<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.420> happens<00:01:03.159> is<00:01:04.159> kind<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.059> hard<00:01:05.269> to

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
see all that happens is kind of hard to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
see all that happens is kind of hard to
reach<00:01:06.100> but<00:01:07.100> as<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.630> can<00:01:08.780> see

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.880 

see<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> chain<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.240> moving<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> wheels

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
see that chain is moving but the wheels

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.609 
see that chain is moving but the wheels
not<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.509> has<00:01:18.689> happened<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.290> about

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
not so this has happened to me about

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
not so this has happened to me about
twice<00:01:20.009> since<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.970> last<00:01:21.299> December<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
twice since I got this last December and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
twice since I got this last December and
it's<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> annoying<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.689> very

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it's kind of annoying when it's very

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's kind of annoying when it's very
fixable<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> expensive<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.000> fix

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
fixable and not that expensive to fix

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
fixable and not that expensive to fix
either<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> happened<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> me<00:01:29.189> twice<00:01:29.399> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
either so it's happened to me twice and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
either so it's happened to me twice and
my<00:01:30.090> dad's<00:01:30.330> like<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.899> with<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> stuff<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.560> he

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
my dad's like good with this stuff so he

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.430 
my dad's like good with this stuff so he
fixes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.990> need<00:01:34.200> mean

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
fixes it for me but you do need mean

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.179 
fixes it for me but you do need mean
part<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.740> reason

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
part so all you have to do is the reason

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
part so all you have to do is the reason
why<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.520> doing<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
why it's doing this is because I want to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
why it's doing this is because I want to
snowy<00:01:40.740> day<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> ice<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.030> doing

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
snowy day on the ice I was doing

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.070 
snowy day on the ice I was doing
burnouts

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
burnouts

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.450 
burnouts
and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.860> reason<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:46.050> can't<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and the reason is that it can't be the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.990 
and the reason is that it can't be the
rpm<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.360> too<00:01:48.630> high<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.409> made<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
rpm is too high it's not made for it to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.169 
rpm is too high it's not made for it to
be<00:01:51.179> like<00:01:51.420> spinning<00:01:52.289> out<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.740> long<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
be like spinning out that long so it

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.559 
be like spinning out that long so it
just<00:01:54.509> stops<00:01:54.810> grabbing<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.580> forget

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
just stops grabbing on to the I forget

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.899 
just stops grabbing on to the I forget
when<00:01:57.720> it's<00:01:57.869> cold<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> thing<00:01:59.220> moves<00:01:59.520> but

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
when it's cold so this thing moves but

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
when it's cold so this thing moves but
it<00:02:00.000> doesn't<00:02:00.299> grab<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.659> wheel<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:02.069> that's<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it doesn't grab the wheel so that's the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999 
it doesn't grab the wheel so that's the
problem<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.539> saw<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> ever<00:02:04.409> happens<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
problem but I saw if it ever happens to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.940
