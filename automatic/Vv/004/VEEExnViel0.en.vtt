00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.770
 informed by that now maxi list and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.400
 technology and the damn video games

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 postponed open world game of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 ubisoft washington even though it is one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 of the candidates for games of the year and the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 study received some criticism 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 show recent trailers that do not look 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 not nearly as well as when 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 originally revealed in e3 of 2012 the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 creative director of the game jonathan 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 morín ensures that the visual level of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 game will be very similar to that first 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
 look that gave us a soft watch dogs 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 two years ago one of the elements that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.989
 mill highlighted are the climatic effects 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 like the rain and the reflection of lights and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.620
 shadows that are going to look really good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.270
 in the final version of the game monín 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.039
 He also commented that he does not think there 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.260
 huge differences between the versions 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.539
 of the game actually said he played it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 I started as well as in playstation 4 and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.410
 they would look very similar though 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 this of course does not apply to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
 versions of play 3 and xbox 360 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 morin ensures that because of all this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.120
 type of negative comments 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.460
 and positive you notice that the game is something 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.770
 that generates a lot of curiosity that a lot 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.480
 people want to play and try it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 fortunately no longer needed for both 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.380
 its launch since it's the next 27 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 of May 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.420
 before everything falls even if you're not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.680
 very involved in the subject of technology 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.899
 surely you heard about heart 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.399
 live a server failure that generated 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.439
 a very serious security problem 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.179
 computer that forced many of the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.799
 most important services in the world to 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.229
 ask its users to change their 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 passwords was chaos was immediate and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.250
 for hours it was impossible to prevent it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 affecting companies like yahoo 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.929
 instagram and netflix the technical flaw 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 was in technology called open that is 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.310
 the axis of the last year had spent on 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.649
 less security than Google spends 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.590
 in window cleaner and yet 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.289
 open ssl is used by a quantity 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 untold of websites that's why it's 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.009
 that the linux foundation dedicated to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.450
 protect and promote the operating system 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.880
 in which the servers of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 all your favorite sites will get the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.200
 batteries will be reversed in troubleshooting 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.049
 of security of basic tools 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.180
 of software between amazon facebook google 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.340
 and several more have already contributed with almost 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
 4 million dollars to recruit a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 huge team of security experts 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.390
 finally cover all the holes 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.030
 technological problems 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.860
 all the achievements all in the world the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.280
 world of warcraft there are many things 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.380
 to do in fact there are 2057 achievements or 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.360
 trophies to get that they include all 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.310
 the expansions of the title a number that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.220
 It seems a bit complicated to reach 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.200
 but a Russian user nicknamed his peak in 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.780
 game did not achieve with a lot of dedication 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.630
 and the help of several friends not only 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 that also got to add 205 of the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.830
 300 feats of strength something that nobody 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.080
 had achieved so far for 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.030
 collect the trophies his peak was the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.370
 first to bring the maximum level of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.170
 progression to a character of each class 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.269
 of the game on your server to achieve 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.070
 this was transferred to servers with little 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.080
 population together with their peers 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.360
 group and played in multiple accounts of 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.310
 simultaneously while their peers 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.320
 they were dedicated to kill anyone who 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.239
 tried to reach level 90 number 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.650
 maximum character progression that 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.620
 has the game until the launch 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.720
 next of its expansion warlords op 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.489
 traynor clearly we can not define 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.860
 this Russian user with other words that 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.500
 Do not be diehard fans of world of 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.070
 warcraft or maybe dangerous psychopaths 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.070
 mazda is in 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 and from Monday to Friday at 19 in 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.950
 damn nerd for southern word where what 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.409
 what you hear is what you see 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.069
 misfits will inherit the earth and for 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:48.650
 that they need to be informed 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.650
 damn action the cortex löw
