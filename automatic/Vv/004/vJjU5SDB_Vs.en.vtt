00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the personal law once again leonardo to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 you to bring a glove that was 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 commemorative for the world cup in 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.780
 brazil that is the rock hauranne deluxe 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.059
 with the palm and none because I did not know 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.220
 Palm mion is a mixture of resistance 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 with flu that in fact is a very good group 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 and that I particularly compared it with 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 with g1 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 good talking about the glove of the various in 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 different parts like you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 can see is not a complete part one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.309
 single piece with 6 mm of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 thickness with the area to punch the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 ball 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.110
 the flat palm with the tensions at the tip of the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.480
 fingers and a mini finder on the thumb 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 as well as the cut in tripoli where the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.949
 indicator and the thumb touches some 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 parts of the one that helps me in breathing 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 hand and between the fingers our 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 and the negative non-domain finger that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 is complete with latex the difference once 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 the difference between the line itself , and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.680
 luxury line 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 The difference is minimal but it makes a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 bit of difference 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.950
 As I said the deluxe have this assistance 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.520
 actions at your fingertips area of 360 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 degrees to be calm and sweet and obviously 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.579
 the back of 6 mm when in the test 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.710
 is only four millimeters 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:43.110
 this year's line she came up with something 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.049
 a bit different than the lines 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 say silicone at your fingertips 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.079
 as you can see to help in a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 the flu 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.149
 we pick up the ball but this is one thing 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.350
 that in the first game I realized that 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.189
 she starts to drop 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.200
 so it's not so important because there 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.350
 some areas where it really started 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.140
 not having more in the bottom in the background no 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.069
 serves no purpose because the palm she 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.069
 has a good grip 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:24.200
 the Munich strap and latex is elastic and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 thus has an area for 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 customization if by chance I want 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.140
 put on board or put a fee 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.390
 vinyl with your name the name of your wife 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.120
 and your daughter from the car even the dog 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.350
 want to have an area to put well 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.709
 this area also to pull it is more 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.709
 resistant and I love this kind of 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.840
 Let 's say technology is stronger and more 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.030
 It helps a lot when it comes to 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.739
 because it has enough space for 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.200
 who put put can put 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.860
 finger on hand as you can see 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 quite comfortable fairly adjustable 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.910
 and but it is a glove that serves both 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.319
 training and to play but she was 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:19.010
 made more into the game and fought hard 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:21.019
 comfortable home pretty well in 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.400
 relation to size for those using the 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.280
 number 9 in the new by cry of nike 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.650
 if you want just that this sleeve 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.269
 You have to get the number 10 that was 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.269
 by any chance, my case 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.000
 the resistance side I usually say 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.859
 resistance depends very much on who 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.530
 Use this glove I already used 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.810
 approximately 56 times on the lawn 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.390
 on the site against seven 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.680
 and how can you see the palm still 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.480
 is intact 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.609
 ok some machines at the tip of the finger 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.840
 It's normal, I can not stay. 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.170
 No one can keep the glove 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 I always sat some without any mark 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.670
 us new palm has even shown in the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.069
 another paulo 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.420
 look that 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.299
 only at the fingertips that it really is 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.060
 because of the south and cone that looses more 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.549
 in that area where everyone falls that does not 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.750
 You know that you put it there when you hit the ground and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.370
 put your hands on the floor 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.250
 it is impossible for the glove to last long 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.390
 is not to train this part and it will last 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.070
 quite a long time 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.690
 any doubt 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.910
 the question and I'll answer more 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.420
 quick as possible thanks guys a hug 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.420
 and until the next
