these sensors instead if you have

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
these sensors instead if you have
multiple<00:00:55.949> vehicles<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.820> each<00:00:57.030> carry

different sensors or different payloads

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
different sensors or different payloads
and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:00.930> collaborate<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.550> their

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then they collaborate to use their

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
and then they collaborate to use their
payloads<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.050> there's<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.470> smaller<00:01:04.800> form

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
payloads but there's a much smaller form

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.220 
payloads but there's a much smaller form
factor<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.090> multiple<00:01:06.330> ways<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> use

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
factor there is multiple ways to use

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.740 
factor there is multiple ways to use
this<00:01:07.410> technology<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> capability

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
this technology and use this capability

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
this technology and use this capability
there's<00:01:09.750> military<00:01:09.930> applications<00:01:10.890> certainly

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's military applications certainly

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.430 
there's military applications certainly
with<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.240> Department<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> Defense<00:01:12.690> but

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
with the Department of Defense but

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.740 
with the Department of Defense but
there's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.940> homeland<00:01:14.940> activities

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
there's a lot of homeland activities

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.720 
there's a lot of homeland activities
that<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> work<00:01:16.410> on<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.160> for<00:01:17.310> example<00:01:17.670> if

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
that we can work on so for example if

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.100 
that we can work on so for example if
you<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.910> forest<00:01:18.270> fire<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> wanted

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you have a forest fire and you wanted

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.290 
you have a forest fire and you wanted
multiple<00:01:19.260> unmanned<00:01:20.220> air<00:01:20.400> vehicles<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> start

multiple unmanned air vehicles to start

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.050 
multiple unmanned air vehicles to start
searching<00:01:22.200> where<00:01:22.620> they<00:01:22.800> one<00:01:23.340> aircraft<00:01:23.820> may

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
searching where they one aircraft may

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.180 
searching where they one aircraft may
see<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> small<00:01:25.110> fire<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.590> may<00:01:25.740> call<00:01:25.950> another

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
see a small fire it may call another

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.980 
see a small fire it may call another
aircraft<00:01:26.430> over<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> confirm<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
aircraft over to confirm that it's a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
aircraft over to confirm that it's a
small<00:01:28.470> fire<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.010> escalating<00:01:29.580> fire

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
small fire and it's an escalating fire

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
small fire and it's an escalating fire
then<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.330> call<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:30.510> third<00:01:30.750> vehicle<00:01:30.990> over

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
then you can call a third vehicle over

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
then you can call a third vehicle over
and<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> maybe<00:01:32.190> drop<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:32.820> water<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and it can maybe drop some water on it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
and it can maybe drop some water on it
or<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> chemical<00:01:33.900> suppressant

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
or put out a chemical suppressant

farm<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.480> think<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.900> future<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.230> really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
farm I think the future is really

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.250 
farm I think the future is really
exciting<00:01:56.160> because<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.150> lot<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.080> can

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
exciting because there's a lot that can

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.440 
exciting because there's a lot that can
be<00:01:58.320> done<00:01:58.800> with<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.460> kinds<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> unmanned<00:02:00.240> air

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
be done with these kinds of unmanned air

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
be done with these kinds of unmanned air
vehicles<00:02:00.960> being<00:02:01.230> able<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> operator

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
vehicles being able to get the operator

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190

out<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.760> loop<00:02:02.910> or<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> operator<00:02:03.570> farther
