00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.920
 Bush tired of seeing this word 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.010
 it is clear that affects us all but who more submissive costs than normal 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.099
 it would be paid by those who caused it 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.900
 we live in a democracy so we can ask for responsibilities 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.820
 who do you want me to pay for this crisis 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.409
 it's up to you 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.409
 we propose you a town here we have nine stages 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.380
 it's about your signals who do you want the duck to pay 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.189
 we'll start with this one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.729
 if I will ask you to take your finger on the card and then I will start counting 1 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.330
 to each number you have to do is move your finger to a card 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.700
 adjacent 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.770
 you can move in any direction 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.110
 but never to arrive every time he stops counting saves from a card he never 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.480
 will be the one that is pointing at that moment 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 at the end there will only be one that you signal 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.480
 this will be who will pay the crisis 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.800
 we started 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.900
 put your finger on the question 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.580
 prepared 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.080
 one 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.340
 let's eliminate is to start 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.250
 second movement 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.070
 one 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.940
 two 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.960
 4 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.860
 5 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.330
 7 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.689
 I think he did not want to point out the banker 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.310
 clear the mortgage to the car loan we have only proposed 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.930
 let's keep going 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.790
 one 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.880
 two 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.100
 the extraterrestrial for therapies 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.770
 until it gives them to invade us 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 better saved us problem 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.790
 there we go again 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.630
 one 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.530
 two 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 4 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 5 6 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.560
 7 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.249
 no matter how much crisis there 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.420
 a good movie is not over 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.780
 let's keep going 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.650
 one 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.630
 4 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 5 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560
 I see where you're going 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 that your team runs out of its crack would be a catastrophe 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.670
 Let's go there 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.509
 one 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.410
 two 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.379
 4 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.199
 5 6 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.239
 8 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.619
 9 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.509
 and military spending 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.109
 in the end someone will have to defend us better the wild 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.589
 there are only three left 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.119
 prepared 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.989
 one 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.169
 two 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.180
 look 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.480
 this is not that they get paid by charging a lot but someone has to take the helm 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 from the country 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.179
 in the end there are always the same 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:40.839
 let's leave doubts 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.709
 to see who you would choose 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.379
 prepared 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.889
 one 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:46.979
 Viajero 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 one has to look for himself 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.779
 those who have least are those who are going to pay for a crisis that they are not 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.209
 guilty 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.559
 in the end 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.539
 It's your choice 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.059
 you feel cheated 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:07.429
 luckily this is a trick but unfortunately something very similar happens 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.499
 when the interests of those who have to be in danger the most 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.389
 you want to do something to avoid it 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.239
 you still have time
