00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.360
 us frequent our gotenn that summer we 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.700
 husband decided to share themselves in our 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.890
 pizza recipes come to us often 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.050
 guests love even pizza we have 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 your secret that I tell you right now 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 really a matter of honor 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.260
 so ingredients now for sauce 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.019
 is on screen for us for this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.840
 will need olive oil jar 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 tomatoes 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.030
 basil and garlic and salt 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 to taste 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.649
 best of course if you have 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.719
 opportunity to have products 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.329
 Italian origin but if not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.809
 then it is of course scary 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.170
 First, cut the garlic finely and also 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.170
 basil on these 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.600
 put the pot on the fire and a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.390
 olive oil we so fry and garlic 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.400
 garlic and fried over medium heat 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:10.159
 discretion boiled over Kiev so that it was 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.460
 so that's soft and transparent so there 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.560
 add a tomato and so they would have whole 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.560
 scapula their differences 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 the sauce is cooked on low heat 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 about an hour and i also add there 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 basil flavor ingredients for the dough you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.640
 Now you can see on the screen of any matter of fact 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 of death 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 option yeast in warm water 2 bags 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.289
 and also a tablespoon of sugar it all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.579
 stir the yeast to dissolve 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:54.390
 now the secret goes a tablespoon of salt 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:59.130
 mixed with grated semolina 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 polola as well as flour and because of this mixture 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.780
 It is precisely the flour and mana of large that turns out 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.709
 purely 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.709
 more so live so either 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.870
 Italian all mix if you 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.510
 there is a car then the car if not of course 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.380
 with arms like we used to do it in part 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.400
 we had such a helper who 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 this job is easy for us 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.560
 from the hook means she is ready then him 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 menu 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.790
 with flour, he should be given somewhere around 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 hour so she grew up in size we 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.670
 put it in the plastic wrap now 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.880
 how hard she leaves therefore 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.400
 can be covered simply with a kitchen towel 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.519
 can be in some kind of dishes that is and so 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.300
 do as you like everything mix 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.110
 then share on here are we glomeruli 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.269
 let's cook somewhere 2 3 pets and the rest 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.580
 freeze because the best is 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 orders immediately kilo freeze 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.269
 dough in the freezer 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.890
 she is always ready even if she descends 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.140
 guests, then give them capes 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.970
 the dough will be defrosted if there will be 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.739
 ready pizza 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.459
 especially since he and pizza can be put 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.000
 anything 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.230
 roll out the dough of any shape is a man 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 square rectangular round like you 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
 whatever 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.209
 the main thing is that it is quality and pizza 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.819
 turned out 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.250
 delicious such thin dough we have 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:42.209
 it turned out and now we want it on 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.939
 the lattice on top would first smear 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.609
 olive oil 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.010
 but also then he is some kind of our sauce 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.790
 which time I tried for an hour I became 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.849
 long delicious and fragrant well and how am I 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.250
 said on the pizza can put all that 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.319
 anywhere in Italy, I was even surprised that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.950
 they make pizza with potatoes so 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.069
 feel free to put everything your heart desires in this 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.889
 since we cooked one pizza 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.150
 cheese and goals and the second pizza we already 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.320
 made a vegetable 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.680
 if possible zhukila zucchini and others 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680
 vegetables 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.570
 I honestly prefer more vegetable 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:31.060
 pizza over of course a matter of taste so put 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.280
 pizza oven about 220 60 degrees 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.140
 preparing it quickly for our example 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.560
 10 minutes but of course give 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.110
 each oven guesses on its own decorate 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.680
 feel all basil tasty add 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.350

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.410
 fresh hand because it adds a 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.330
